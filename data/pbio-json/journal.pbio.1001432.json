  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nDetection of viral infection by CD8 T cells relies on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) presentation of virally derived peptides at the cell surface. Not surprisingly, a wide variety of viruses have evolved mechanisms to disrupt antigen presentation by targeting the assembly and trafficking pathways used by MHCI proteins [1],[2]. The most common immune evasion mechanism appears to be blockade of cytosol-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) peptide transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) [3]–[10]. However, other viruses target molecular chaperones to impair the quality of peptide loading without curtailing peptide supply [11],[12]. The quality of peptide loading by MHCI is initially controlled by the peptide loading complex (PLC) made up of TAP, tapasin (Tpn), ERp57, and calreticulin (CRT) [13]. Prior to binding an optimal peptide, the PLC retains in the ER nascent MHCI heavy chains (HCs) assembled with beta-2 microglobulin (β2m). Within the PLC, the MHCI-dedicated chaperone Tpn bridges the HC/β2m complex with TAP. Once a peptide of suitable affinity binds to the HC/β2m complex, the fully assembled MHCI is released from the PLC to transit to the cell surface; and perhaps not surprisingly, there are examples of viral immune evasion proteins that impair peptide loading by blocking PLC assembly [11],[12]. In addition to PLC-imposed quality control, non-PLC-associated CRT uses a KDEL-dependent mechanism to retrieve suboptimally loaded MHCI from the early Golgi to the ER to improve peptide binding [14]. This ER retrieval is dependent upon the C-terminal KDEL sequence of CRT that confers binding to the KDEL receptor (KDELR) in the early Golgi in a pH-dependent manner [15].\n\nSeveral viral immune evasion proteins appear to directly target MHCI proteins, but only adenovirus (AdV) E3-19K and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US2 have been shown to directly bind MHCI luminal domains [16],[17]. E3-19K impairs MHCI egress from the ER by either an ER-retention mechanism dependent on its cytoplasmic tail [18] or its ability to prevent Tpn bridging MHCI to TAP [11], while US2 targets MHCI for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) [19]. E3-19K and US2 both exhibit distinct class Ia allele preferences [20]–[22] that may help these viruses evade natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity on the basis of missing self [23]. Alternatively, viruses may encode separate proteins to undermine NK cell surveillance [24]. Interestingly, E3-19K has also been reported to target various MHCI assembly intermediates, and mutagenesis analyses suggest that E3-19K may interact with an MHCI surface similar to that bound by US2 [20],[22]. The only structural study of direct MHCI sabotage revealed that US2 uses an Ig-like fold to bind under the MHCI-binding platform near where the N-terminus of the peptide is anchored [25]. Although US2 was crystallized bound to fully assembled MHCI, cellular studies suggest US2 also targets HC before full assembly with peptide and/or β2m [26]. In any case, the structural basis for how US2, E3-19K, or any other viral immune evasion protein discriminates MHCI alleles and/or assembly intermediates has not been previously reported.\n\nWhile many viruses exhibit strict host specificity, some orthopoxviruses are able to productively infect a wide variety of mammalian species and encode an array of immunomodulatory genes that target both cell intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral responses [27]. Yet until recently, orthopoxviruses were not known to target antigen presentation. The orthopoxvirus cowpox (CPXV) expresses two unrelated immune evasion proteins, CPXV012 and CPXV203 (UniProt [UNP]: Q8QMP2), which use different mechanisms to block antigen presentation in both human and murine cells [28]–[30]. CPXV012 is a small type II transmembrane protein that blocks peptide transport by TAP [29],[30]. By contrast, CPXV203 is a soluble protein that prevents MHCI proteins from trafficking to the plasma membrane by a mechanism dependent upon its C-terminal KTEL sequence, a motif recognized by the KDELR [28]. To initially probe binding partners, Byun et al. (2007) showed that CPXV203 co-precipitated with MHCI and not TAP. These findings implied that CPXV203 binds MHCI lumenal domains or an associated molecule before and/or after peptide assembly [28]. Furthermore, CPXV203 was found to down regulate MHCI proteins in both murine and human cell lines during normal poxvirus infection [29],[30]. This ability to broadly inhibit MHCI by CPXV203 may help explain productive CPXV zoonotic infection of various mammalian species other than small rodents, the apparent CPXV host reservoir [27]. Indeed, mutant cowpox viruses lacking both CPXV012 and CPXV203 demonstrate attenuated virulence in a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent manner [29], in contrast to other viral proteins that target MHCI that do not appear to significantly modulate primary infection in vivo [31],[32].\n\nHere we provide a precise understanding of how CPXV203 binds to a broad array of MHCI complexes that includes both classical and non-classical molecules. Biosensor studies indicate that CPXV203 binds MHCI weakly at the pH found in the ER, but the affinity and half-life are significantly augmented at the more acidic conditions found in the Golgi. Crystallographic analysis reveals that CPXV203 adopts a β-sandwich topology reminiscent of poxvirus chemokine-binding proteins, and this domain engages evolutionarily conserved MHCI determinants available only on fully assembled MHCI. We also undertook mutagenesis analysis that supports the structural model and uncovered the critical functional role played by two CPXV203 His residues in the pH regulation of complex stability. Together these data suggest that CPXV203 works cooperatively with the endogenous KDEL-mediated Golgi retrieval process to promiscuously target fully assembled MHCI, thereby preventing T-cell killing of cowpox infected cells.\n\n      Results\n      \n        CPXV203 Downregulates Fully Assembled MHCI\n        \nTo ascertain which MHCI assembly state(s) is targeted by CPXV203, association with the HC of murine H-2Kb (UNP: P01901) was monitored by co-precipitation in wild-type and β2m-deficient cells. CPXV203 only co-precipitated with Kb HC in cells expressing β2m (UNP: Q91XJ8) (Figure 1A), suggesting that heterodimer assembly is required for CPXV203/MHCI association. To further assess whether this association was dependent upon the PLC, CPXV203 was expressed by transduction in cells lacking either TAP or Tpn, which present low levels of fully assembled MHCI. As shown in Figure 1B, CPXV203 dramatically reduced MHCI surface expression in cells lacking TAP or Tpn, whereas the TAP inhibitor CPXV012 did not affect surface expression in these PLC-component deficient cells. We also found that CPXV203 comparably downregulates MHCI expression in cells with and without CRT (Figure 1C), suggesting that CPXV203 expression does not grossly disrupt CRT-associated ER quality control as could potentially occur through KDELR competition. In further support of this conclusion, CPXV203 does not interfere with PLC assembly, as shown by normal TAP/Tpn association and normal steady-state levels of CRT (Figure 1D). Previous studies found comparable peptide loading in cells with and without CPXV203, and failed to identify association of CPXV203 with the PLC [28]. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that CPXV203 regulates the surface expression of fully assembled MHCI after dissociation from the PLC without impairing PLC function.\n\n        CPXV203 Engages MHCI in a pH-dependent Manner\n        \nWe next sought to examine whether CPXV203 directly binds to MHCI using soluble recombinant proteins in biophysical assays. We observed that CPXV203 binds Kb with an affinity of KD,Kin = 480 nM at pHER 7.4 using surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) (Figure 2A). The expansion of these studies to additional MHCI molecules revealed that CPXV203 exhibits low affinity interactions (KD,Kin = 82–10,500 nM) with five different murine Ia alleles (Db, Dq, Kb, Kd, Ld) and a primate allele (Ceat-B*12) (Table S1). We also examined a non-classical MHC Ib protein, murine thymic leukemia tumor antigen or TL (T3b), which was engaged by CPXV203 with similar affinity and kinetics at pHER 7.4 as observed for Kb. Unlike classical MHCI proteins that require peptide loading to assemble, TL pairs with β2m and is stable in the absence of ligand binding. Thus, it appears that the requirement for peptide binding to classical MHC Ia proteins for CPXV203 engagement is based on the role peptide loading plays in assembly and stability rather than direct recognition. Promiscuous CPXV203/MHCI association fits well with the previously published data that CPXV203 downregulates murine H-2D and -K alleles, though the affinities were weaker than those previously reported for the viral ER retention protein E3-19K (11–18 nM) [22].\n\nThe weaker than expected affinity of CPXV203 for MHCI led us to evaluate a variety of buffer conditions that might more closely reproduce ER/Golgi conditions (divalent cations: Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+; ATP; pH 6–8). Of these changes, only low pH augmented CPXV203/MHCI affinity with a decrease to pHGolgi 6.0 increasing the affinity ∼50-fold (KD,Kin = 10 nM, Figure 2B). This striking enhancement occurs through both an increased on-rate (ka) and a decreased off-rate (kd) for all tested murine and primate alleles (Table S1). We confirmed these results using a separate biophysical technique, biolayer interferometry (BLI), where the equilibrium response of CPXV203 binding murine (H-2Dk, -Kb,k, -Ld; TL) and primate MHCI (Mamu-A*01, Patr-B*0802) was monitored as a function of pH (7.6–6.0) (Figure 2C). These binding studies demonstrate that the stability of CPXV203/MHCI complexes is pH regulated to favor association in the Golgi rather than the ER. Importantly, similar observations have been made for the binding of KDEL bearing ligands to the KDELR [15].\n\nTo address whether enhanced binding of CPXV203 to MHCI at low pH results from changes in the stoichiometry of the complex, multi-angle light scattering (MALS) experiments were undertaken that demonstrated a 1∶1 stoichiometry that was insensitive to pH manipulation from pH 6.5–8.5 (Figure S1). We also undertook circular dichroism spectra analysis that indicated that the conformation of these proteins (alone or in complex) does not change significantly as a function of pH (unpublished data). These results support the 1∶1 binding model used in our biosensor analysis and suggest that CPXV203/MHCI pH regulation likely involves only small local effects.\n\n        Structure of the CPXV203/MHCI Complex\n        \nWe next pursued crystallographic studies of CPXV203 in complex with MHCI to better understand the nature of the interaction. Utilizing the observation that CPXV203 binding affinity increases with decreasing pH, we crystallized SeMet-labeled CPXV203 in complex with Kb loaded with SIINFEKL (OVA257–264) at pH 5.55 and determined the structure at 3.0 Å resolution (Figure 3A; Table S2). Initial molecular replacement phases using MHCI alone were greatly improved through cross-crystal averaging (Figure S2A–S2D) [33], which allowed a preliminary backbone trace of CPXV203 to be built. Subsequently, molecular replacement-single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MR-SAD) was used to identify eight SeMet sites and introduce anomalous phase information (figure of merit [FOM] 0.604) that improved map quality to the point where the complete CPXV203/MHCI complex could be built and refined. The structure reveals that CPXV203 binds below the MHCI peptide-binding platform, contacting both the HC (α2- and α3-domains) and β2m. Comparison of Kb free and bound by CPXV203 did not indicate any significant changes associated with viral protein engagement. The general footprint located below the α2-1 helix of Kb is supported by serological experiments whereby we determined whether CPXV203 competed with monoclonal antibodies specific for well-characterized epitopes. Direct binding competition was observed for two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (AF6-88.5.3 and Y-3) that have been mapped precisely to this region, and no competition was observed for three MAbs mapped outside of the CPXV203 footprint (Figure S2F–S2H). We note that while HCMV US2 also binds MHCI below the peptide-binding platform, the CPXV203 footprint is completely distinct and, strikingly, overlaps with that of Tpn, CD8, and NK cell receptors (NKRs) (Figure 3B).\n\n        CPXV203 Is Structurally Related to Poxvirus Chemokine-Binding Proteins\n        \nThe structure of CPXV203 does not resemble any structurally characterized viral or host protein known to interact with MHCI. The single domain of CPXV203 (209 aa) is a globular β-sandwich that is stabilized by five disulfide bonds conserved in all T4 poxvirus protein family members (Figures 4A, 4B, S3A). The core β-sandwich consists of two parallel β-sheets (β-sheet I: β1, β5, β6, β10; β-sheet II: β2, β3, β4, β7, β8, β9) made up of anti-parallel strands with one parallel strand interaction (β7/β9) bridging the two segments of β-sheet II (Figure 4B). Three of these disulfide bonds appear to stabilize the h4-loop-h5 arrangement used to engage the MHCI α2-domain. A search for structurally similar proteins indicates that the CPXV203 β-sandwich core resembles the structurally characterized poxvirus chemokine binding proteins (CKBPs), such as the vCCI-like protein encoded by ectromelia virus, EVM001 [34], which exhibits an RMSD of 3.0 Å for 143 aligned residues (Figure S3B; Table S3).\n\nCPXV203 and the poxvirus CKBPs engage their ligands using completely distinct binding surfaces located on opposite faces of the β-sandwich core (Figure 4C). While vCCI-like proteins use β-sheet II to bind chemokines, CPXV203 primarily uses β-sheet I elements. Interestingly, the Ectromelia virus CrmD-CTD (SECRET domain) also appears to use β-sheet I elements to bind chemokines, and it shares with CPXV203 a distinct β7–β9 junction relative to vCCI-like proteins that increases β-sheet I accessibility through the conversion of a flexible loop into a β-sheet II strand (Figure 4D). CPXV203 has further differences with the vCCI core with the replacement of vCCI β13-β14 with two α-helices (h4 and h5), a modification that also exposes CPXV203 β10 to interact with β2m. For CPXV203, these topological changes remove potential steric clashes (Figure S3C), increase solvent-accessibility of the conserved β5–β6 loop (source of nearly all α3 contacts), and create the primary sources for both α2 (h4–h5) and β2m (β8 and β10) contacts (Figure 4B; Table S4). Thus, while CPXV203 is clearly structurally related to poxvirus CKBPs, significant modifications are clearly evident that uniquely allow it to recognize MHCI.\n\n        CPXV203 Contacts Conserved Elements within Each MHCI Domain\n        \nTo understand the structural basis of how CPXV203 interacts with such diverse MHCI-family proteins, we analyzed the conservation of MHCI contacts and the similarity of these contacts to those used by other MHCI-binding proteins. CPXV203 promiscuously binds MHCI through a large, somewhat nonpolar interface divided into three distinct contact regions (α2, α3, and β2m domains) (Figures 5A, 5B, S4A, S4B). The arrangement of these contact regions is only available in fully assembled MHCI, and as such CPXV203 binds MHCI in an assembly-dependent manner that is peptide-independent as long as MHCI assembly is also peptide-independent, as is the case for TL. Comparison of the CPXV203/MHCI interface to similar interfaces reveals that the total buried surface area (BSA) is significantly larger than most other complexes, CPXV203 buries &gt;200 Å2 more main-chain (MC) than any similar MHCI-binder, and only CPXV203 divides its interface nearly equally among the platform (α1/α2), β2m, and α3 (Figure 5A; Table S5). CPXV203 recognizes MHCI elements that are extremely well conserved in all murine pMHCI: overall, 86%; CPXV203 contacts, 91%; CPXV203 side chain (SC) contacts, 95%; five invariant SC contacts. Further, CPXV203 recognizes core structural features of the MHCI fold by anchoring each of the three domain interfaces through a buried MC-MC hydrogen bond and two to three MC-SC hydrogen bonds (Figure S4C–S4E; Table S4). Through these contacts, CPXV203 recognizes seven backbone positions conserved by the MHCI fold and coordinates conserved MHCI side chains within the α3 interface (Q226, D227, E229) also required for Tpn and CD8 association [35]–[37]. Further, the presence of CPXV203 His residues opposite negatively charged α3 domain residues (H75-D227, H80-E229) suggests these may be pH-regulated interactions, though only H80-E229 is close enough to form a direct contact (3.5 Å versus 7.3 Å). Finally, we have identified that CPXV203 downregulates the non-classical MHCI molecule H2-M3, while mCD1d escapes CPXV203 retrieval (Figure S4F, S4G). Our structural results support the idea that escape by mCD1d is facilitated in part by a charge reversal at position 229 (mCD1d H233 – CPXV203 H80) and the orientation of mCD1d Q230 away from the interface due to an altered CD-loop conformation (Figure S4H). This structural investigation explains promiscuous MHCI retrieval by CPXV203, as it specifically targets a tri-domain interface of evolutionarily conserved contacts that would only be presented by fully assembled MHCI.\n\n        Critical Role of CPXV203 His-75 and His-80 in pH-Regulated MHCI Interactions\n        \nWe assessed the functional relevance of specific determinants within the CPXV203/MHCI binding interface by extensive mutagenesis of both CPXV203 and Kb. Mutants were assayed for loss of function by rescue of surface Kb expression or lack of physical association by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Single mutations in either Kb or CPXV203 from all three interaction sites (Figure 5) were tested, but only α3 interface mutations Kb E229Y and CPXV203 F76A significantly rescued Kb surface expression (Figure 6A, 6B). Furthermore, double mutations within the α3 interface (Kb D227K/E229Y, CPXV203 H75A/H80A, Kb Q226A/CPXV203 F76A, Kb E229Y/CPXV203 H75A, Kb E229Y/CPXV203 F76A) or the simultaneous mutation of interfaces α2 and α3 (CPXV203 Y161A, F76A) significantly enhanced Kb rescue, with some mutants displaying complete ablation of CPXV203 function (Figure 6A–6C). Physical association (CPXV203-HA/Kb) was impaired more dramatically than Kb rescue by single α3 interface mutations (Figure 6D), though it should be noted that the HA-tag might impair association. In any case, these experiments clearly demonstrate the functional importance of our structurally defined interface in CPXV203-mediated MHCI association and retrieval.\n\nTo extend these findings, biosensor studies were undertaken to probe the contribution of individual interface residues in binding and pH regulation. Equilibrium analysis (BLI, pHER 7.4) of CPXV203 and MHCI mutants further confirmed the three-site binding footprint (Figure 5) and clearly distinguished the CPXV203 binding site from those of E3-19K, US2, and MAb Y-3 (Table S6). Alanine mutation of several CPXV203 residues within the α3-domain interface (including His residues 75 and 80) had a pronounced deficit in binding (similar to co-IP). CPXV203 H75 and H80 were selected for kinetic analysis (SPR) based on their chemical environment (Figure S4E) and previously described sensitivity to alanine mutation (functional and association). Alanine mutation of either His ablated the off-rate (kd) enhancement at low pH, while maintaining a similar on-rate (ka) enhancement (Figure 6E; Table S7). Thus at low pH, α3 interface His residues act to extend the CPXV203/MHCI half-life (6 s–73 s), while a separate interaction appears to regulate the faster association (ka) observed at low pH. Consistent with their importance, the double mutant (H75A, H80A) displayed extremely weak affinity that prohibited accurate kinetic analysis, though equilibrium BLI assays clearly support the greater functional deficit observed for this mutant (Table S6). These investigations indicate that CPXV203 engages MHCI through critical pH-regulated interactions with conserved MHCI α3-domain determinants, while the α2 and β2m domain interfaces may enable CPXV203 to bind fully assembled MHCI with broad specificity.\n\n      Discussion\n      \nViral infection of mammalian hosts can be greatly facilitated by viral proteins that confer the ability to evade CTL detection and clearance. Not surprisingly, viruses have evolved a wide variety of strategies to reduce cell surface presentation of viral peptides on MHCI [1],[2]. The cellular, structural, and biophysical results reported here provide a complete picture of one such strategy, as CPXV203 was shown to directly bind fully assembled MHCI in a manner that is regulated via the normal pH gradient that exists between the ER and Golgi compartments (Figure 7). Though CPXV203 makes contacts to three distinct MHCI domains, pH regulation of the complex half-life is critically dependent on CPXV203 His residues that bind to an α3-domain acidic CD loop important for both Tpn and CD8 association. Thus, CPXV203 exploits a cellular pathway to target MHCI surfaces critical for immunological function in a manner that selects for those MHCI molecules most likely to present viral peptides.\n\nRemarkably, CPX203 is not related to any other MHCI-binding protein, but rather it is most structurally related to poxvirus CKBPs. To our knowledge, CPXV203 is the first member of the large T4 poxvirus protein family [38] to be structurally characterized, suggesting a previously underappreciated link between the poxvirus CKBPs and T4 protein families through similarities in their β-sandwich core. Regardless of the evolutionary history, the adaptation of this protein domain to structurally distinct ligands and unrelated functional outcomes suggests the integral role that CPXV203 plays in antigen presentation disruption may not be its only function.\n\nCPXV203 evolved into a promiscuous MHCI-binding protein by targeting MHCI determinants that are largely conserved by virtue of their roles in the recognition by host factors essential to cellular immunity (Tpn, CD8, NKRs). For instance, many α2-domain contacts (R111, Q115, E128, T134) are conserved through Tpn (α2 128–136) [37],[39] and Ly49 (R111, Q115, D122) [40] interactions, while the β2m contacts primarily involve structurally conserved backbone positions within the LIR-1/MHCI interface [41]. The direct overlap of CD8 and Tpn contact sites (Q226, D227, E229) [35]–[37] in the acidic CD loop of the α3 domain is clearly exploited by CPXV203 for MHCI binding, and this interface is precisely where we have identified two His residues in the viral protein that regulate increased kinetic stability at the lower pH of the Golgi.\n\nPrevious investigations of pH-dependent endosomal (PRL/PRLr [42], FcRn/Fc [43]) and ER→Golgi (RAP/LRP) [44] trafficking have repeatedly identified His residues as the pH sensitive component of these regulatory mechanisms. Unlike other amino acids, histidine is well suited to serve this function, as small pH shifts can drastically change the charge and hydrogen-bonding potential of this residue. As such, our investigation of CPXV203/MHCI pH regulation focused on interface histidines, which revealed a significant contribution of CPXV203 H75 and H80 to complex half-life at low pH. We suggest that these titratable His residues endow CPXV203 with the ability to regulate fully assembled MHCI in a manner that is complementary to the regulation of PLC-associated MHCI by CPXV012.\n\nThe specific binding of CPXV203 to fully assembled MHCI proteins in a pH-dependent manner clarifies mechanistically how CPXV203 coordinates with CPXV012 to effectively block antigen presentation. Previous characterizations showed the CPXV012 functions in a PLC-dependent fashion to block TAP transport of peptide into the ER [29],[30]. However, some MHCI-binding peptides in the ER are not TAP-dependent and the CPXV012 block of peptide transport is likely not absolute. The MHCI proteins that are able to bind peptide in the presence of CPXV012 are left to CPXV203, since it binds fully assembled MHCI through domain-specific conformational determinants conserved in classical and many non-classical MHCI. Among these interactions, the α3 interface is particularly important based on the presence of CPXV203 His residues that impart pH regulation to the CPXV203/MHCI interaction. This pH dependence suggests that CPXV203/MHCI interacts most avidly in the Golgi and not the ER, thus limiting the pool of MHCI that CPXV203 must retrieve.\n\nInterestingly, CRT has a C-terminal KDEL sequence conferring ER retrieval, and non-PLC-associated CRT has recently been implicated in quality control of MHCI peptide loading [14]. More specifically, CRT was shown to accumulate in the cis-Golgi and return peptide accessible MHCI proteins to the ER. Both CRT and CPXV203 retrieve MHCI proteins but with opposite goals. CRT functions in host quality control by retrieving MHCI with suboptimal peptides, whereas CPXV203 functions in immune evasion by retrieving fully assembled MHCI to block antigen presentation. Thus CPXV012 and -203 act sequentially to efficiently block MHCI expression using PLC-dependent versus PLC-independent mechanisms, respectively. As a possible consequence of efficient MHCI downregulation resulting in NK cell susceptibility, CPXV expresses the soluble class I-like protein OMCP that functions as a competitive antagonist of the NKG2D-activating receptor [24]. Indeed, the combined sabotage of both CTL and NK cell detection of virus-infected cells explains why mutant CPXV lacking CPXV012 and 203 demonstrates attenuated virulence in vivo compared to wild-type virus [29].\n\n      Methods\n      \n        Antibodies\n        \nMHCI-specific MAbs used in SPR competition assays were obtained from the ATCC (H-2Kb: 25-D1.1.6, B8-24-3, Y-3), purchased from BioLegend (Kb: AF6-88.5.3, Kb/Db: 28-8-6, Kd/Dd: 34-1-2S, hβ2m: 2M2), or provided as a kind gift (Kb: 5F1-2-14) from S. Nathenson (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) and L. Pease (Mayo Clinic, Minnesota). MAbs that were not purchased from BioLegend were purified from ascites on a Bio-Rad Profinia FPLC using Protein A or G. MAbs used in flow-cytometry and IP assays have been described previously. MAb footprints in Figure S2H are based on SPR data from this work and available literature (Text S1).\n\n        Peptides\n        \nPeptides were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry and then subjected to reverse-phase HPLC for purification. Peptides were resuspended at &gt;1 mM in ddH2O, DMSO, or 6M GuHCl, as dictated by peptide solubility. Peptides were chosen based on available MHCI crystal structures or personal suggestions by A. Stout (NIH Tetramer Core Facility). See Text S1 for a list of all peptides used in this study.\n\n        Cell Lines\n        \nMurine embryo fibroblast (MEF) B6/WT3 (WT3) and mutant MEFs including TAP1-deficient cells (FT1−), Tapasin-deficient cells (Tpn−/−), calreticulin-deficient cells (CRT−/−), β2m-deficient cells (B6.B2M−) and triple knockout fibroblasts (Kb−/− Db−/− β2m−/−; 3KO) were all derived from C57BL/6 (H-2b) embryos and have been described previously [45]. The CPXV203 and Kb mutants were stably expressed in the indicated cells by retroviral expression vectors pMXsIG [28] and pMIN [45], respectively. Cells transduced by pMIN were selected by neomycin while green fluorescent protein (GFP+) cells from pMXsIG transduced lines were enriched by cell sorting.\n\n        Immunoprecipitations, Immunoblot, and Cross-linking\n        \nFor co-IPs (TAP1/Tpn and CPXV203-HA/H-2Kb), cells were lysed in PBS with 1.0% digitonin (Wako) and protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche) for 60 min. Post-nuclear lysates were then incubated with indicated antibodies + protein A-sepharose (Sigma) or anti-HA sepharose (sigma) for HA-tagged CPXV203 for 1 h. After washes, coprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer (Invitrogen). For cross-linking treatment (CPXV203-HA/H-2Kb), cells were incubated with 1–2 mM DSP (Thermo) in PBS for 2 h at 4°C. The cross-linking was terminated with 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 before the cells were lysed in PBS with 1.0% NP-40. Following immunoprecipitation cross-linked proteins were eluted by boiling in LDS sample butter with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoblot of precipitated proteins was performed following SDS-PAGE separation. Specific proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Thermo).\n\n        Flow Cytometry\n        \nAll flow cytometric analyses were performed using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Staining was performed as described [46]. PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Pharmingen) was used to visualize MHCI staining. PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD1d (eBioscience) was used to detect surface CD1d. GFP signal representing CPXV203 transduced cells were collected in the FITC channel.\n\n        Protein Production\n        \nMammalian CPXV203ΔKTEL (aa 1–205, etgMVI-LHV), bacterial CPXV203ΔKTEL (aa 1–205, maMVI-LHV), and bacterial MHCI were produced using established methods (Text S1). Kb (aa 0–280, mGPH-PST)/H-2Kd (aa 0–283, mGPH-VSN) constructs were produced in house, while H-2Dd, H-2Dk, H-2Dq, H-2Kk, H-2Ld, Mamu-A*01, Patr-B*0802, H-2Q9-H-2Db, H-2Kb-HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0201-H-2Kb were produced by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility. H-2Db biotinylated monomer (LCMV Gp33, KAVYNFATC) was purchased from Beckman Coulter. Biotinylated constructs included a C-terminal site-specific biotinylation tag and were biotinylated by following established procedures (Avidity). Chimeric mCD1d-Fc produced in a murine cell line was obtained from R&amp;D Systems. All MHCI include human β2m (hβ2m, aa 0–99, mIQR-RDM, UNP: P61769) unless otherwise noted. Signal-peptide/cloning artifacts are indicated as lower-case aa.\n\n        X-ray Structure Determination\n        \nCPXV203 (Brighton Red strain, SeMet-labeled)/MHCI(OVA257–264:H-2Kb:hβ2m) complex was prepared for crystallization by size-exclusion chromatography purification of CPXV203/MHCI in low pH/salt buffer (50 mM NaCl, 30 mM MES pH 5.6, 0.01% Azide). Diffraction-quality crystals of CPXV203/MHCI were grown at 20°C by streak seeding into hanging drops of 0.5 µl complex (7.5 mg/ml) +0.5 µl reservoir solution (10% PEG 6000, 4% glucose, 2% ethylene glycol, 0.1 M tri-K citrate pH 5.55, 0.01% Azide). Crystals were dehydrated, flash frozen in liquid N2, and then used for X-ray data collection at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 4.2.2 (0.97909 Å wavelength). Crystals belong to space group P1 (a = 88.31 Å, b = 88.25 Å, c = 106.42 Å; α = 76.18°, β = 69.29°, γ = 66.69°) with four CPXV203/MHCI complexes per asymmetric unit (ASU) and a solvent content of 52%. The HKL2000 software package [47] was used to index, integrate, and scale the data, yielding an 87.9% complete dataset at 3.0 Å (R-sym = 16.4%) (Table S2). The structure of H-2Kbm8:mβ2m (2CLZ) [48] was used for molecular replacement (MR) using Phaser within the Phenix suite [49], with four MHCI proteins located within the ASU. Electron density for the unique CPXV203 region was improved by cross-crystal averaging [33] allowing an initial model of CPXV203 to be manually built in Coot [50]. MR-SAD using AutoSol (Phenix suite [49]) was subsequently used to identify eight SeMet sites in the four CPXV203 monomers, enabling the introduction of anomalous phase information (figure of merit [FOM] 0.604) that improved map quality allowing for complete CPXV203/MHCI model building. Phenix Refine [49] was used with global non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints to refine the CPXV203/MHCI structure to a final Rwork of 22.9% and Rfree 25.3% (see Table S2 for complete crystallographic statistics). The final CPXV203/MHCI model contains four CPXV203/MHCI complexes and 72 water molecules. Each complex contains the nearly complete CPXV203 (mature residues 5–190), Kb (mature residue 1–277), human β2m (0M-99), and OVA257–264. All structure figures were created using PyMOL [51]. See Text S1 for comprehensive crystallization, data collection, structure determination, refinement, structural analysis, and figure preparation details.\n\n        Biophysical Characterization of CPXV203/MHCI Interaction\n        \nSPR experiments were run on a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare) in either standard HBS-EP+ (pH 7.4) or low pH MBS-EP+ (pH 6.0). Kinetic and equilibrium analyses were performed using Biacore T100 Evaluation software using a 1∶1 Langmuir model. BLI experiments were performed on an Octet RED system (ForteBio) using HBS-EP+/MBS-EP+ supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) TWEEN and 1% BSA. Equilibrium BLI data was analyzed using Octet software (V7.0). All biosensor experiments were run at 25°C and followed proper biosensor experimental technique. Size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments were run on a Dawn HELEOS-II 18-angle light scattering detector (Wyatt) and Optilab rEX refractive index monitor (Wyatt) linked to a Waters HPLC system. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed on a DynaPro-801TC. Circular dichroism was measured using a Jasco-810 instrument (Jasco Inc.). Detailed methodologies for biosensor, light scattering, and circular dichroism experiments are available in Text S1.\n\n      Supporting Information"
