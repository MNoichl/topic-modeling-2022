  "abstract": "The Drosophila homolog of the Alzheimer's disease protein APP, known as APPL, regulates axon growth during brain development.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nThe Wnt Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway is a highly conserved regulator of cellular orientation within the plane of an epithelium [1],[2]. Genetic and molecular studies in Drosophila indicate Disheveled (Dsh), a cytoplasmic transducer of Wnt signaling; Frizzled (Fz), a seven-transmembrane receptor for Wnt ligands; and Van Gogh (Vang), a four-pass transmembrane protein, as core Wnt-PCP proteins. Intriguingly, the Wnt-PCP pathway regulates axon outgrowth rather than neuronal polarity during brain development of both vertebrates and Drosophila [3]–[5]. The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a member of a highly conserved family of type I transmembrane proteins that includes APP, APLP1, and APLP2 [6] in mammals and APP-Like, or APPL, in Drosophila melanogaster [7]. APP proteins show not only structural but also functional conservation, as exemplified by the ability of human APP to rescue behavioral phenotypes of APPL null flies [8]. APP is the subject of intense research because of genetic and biochemical links to Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereby the proteolytic processing of APP generates the Amyloid Beta peptide whose accumulation in the brain is widely thought to induce neurodegeneration [9]–[12]. Despite these efforts, the normal physiological function of APP in vivo in the nervous system remains elusive and highly controversial. This is due to the lack of a consensus over the neuronal phenotypes in null mutant animals and the mechanism of APP action in vivo. APP knock-out mice are viable and show developmental neuronal deficits, namely cortical migration and agenesis of the corpus callosum, at variable penetrance depending on genetic background [13]–[15]. In contrast, another in vivo report, based mainly on gain of function and RNA interference experiments, suggests that APP may be required for developmental axonal degeneration [16], although it is unclear whether APP knock-out mice show these phenotypes. Finally, initial findings proposed an axonal transport function for APP [17] but later studies strongly questioned the presence of these defects in APP knock-out mice [18].\n\nMechanistically, there is also disagreement on whether APP acts cell autonomously or non autonomously. For example, an extensive network of molecular interactions has been described for the intracellular domain of APP [19], yet a knock-in of APP lacking the intracellular domain appears to rescue physiological and learning deficits reported in APP knock-out mice, suggesting that the intracellular domain is dispensable [20]. Because current models based on Amyloid toxicity do not provide a complete explanation for the onset of neuronal dysfunction in AD, it has long been argued that greater attention needs to shift towards understanding the normal physiological function of APP in order to assess its potential contribution to AD pathology [21],[22]. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the in vivo physiological function of APP proteins is of paramount importance. To elucidate the function and mechanism of action of APP proteins in vivo, we first investigated Drosophila APPL, the APP homologue in the fruit fly, as a model system. We show that APPL is a novel neuronal-specific modulator of the PCP pathway required for the robustness of axonal outgrowth during the development of the Mushroom Bodies (MB), a Drosophila center for learning and memory. APPL carries out this function through facilitating the PCP-specific phosphorylation of the Wnt adaptor protein Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) by the Abelson kinase (Abl). Furthermore, we show that APPL is part of the membrane complex formed by Wnt-PCP core proteins. Finally, biochemical and cell biological analyses show that human APP immunoprecipitates mammalian PCP proteins and that APP proteins are necessary for Dvl phosphorylation in response to the PCP ligand Wnt5a. Therefore, the APP proteins represent a novel and conserved family of neuronal modulators of Wnt-PCP signaling required for the robustness of brain wiring during development.\n\n      Results\n      \n         APPL Is a Robustness Factor Required Cell-Autonomously for MB β-Lobe Development\n         \nDrosophila APPL is a neuronal-specific protein expressed in most, if not all, neurons throughout development and adult life. In particular, APPL is highly expressed in the developing Drosophila MB, especially the so-called αβ neurons (Figure 1A–D). Flies null for Appl (henceforth Appl−/−) are viable, fertile, and reported to show no gross structural defects in the brain [8]. While a requirement for APPL in learning and memory specifically in adult flies has been shown [23], the function of its pan-neuronal expression throughout development remains unknown, as does the in vivo mechanism of its action(s).\n\nWe began addressing the function of APPL in neuronal development by carefully examining the development of the Drosophila MB in Appl−/− mutant flies. The MB derives from two groups of four neuroblasts, one in each hemisphere, that sequentially generate three subsets of neurons: the γ-, α′β′ and αβ neurons, where APPL is highly expressed. Each αβ neuron projects an axon that branches into a dorsal “α branch” and a medial “β branch.” The fascicles generated by each of these branches are referred to as the α lobe and β lobe. The α and β lobes can be easily visualized using the anti-FascilinII (FasII) antibody. The lobes were present and morphologically normal in 97 adult control animals (Figure 1E) examined. In contrast, 26% of Appl−/− brains examined (n = 101) showed axonal defects (Figure S1). Specifically, 14% of the brains show α-lobe loss (Figure 1F), whereas 12% of the brains show β-lobe loss (Figure 1G). These defects are developmental in origin as they can be observed during αβ lobe formation at 48 h of pupal development (Figure 1H–J). To ascertain whether APPL acts cell autonomously to regulate MB axonal outgrowth, we generated GFP-marked single Appl−/− cell clones using the MARCM technique [24]. While none of the control clones showed any defects (Figure 2A), 10% of the mutant clones showed lack of β-lobe growth (Figures 2B and S2A), similar to the penetrance observed in null mutant brains. However, none of the mutant clones showed loss of α-lobe growth. Taken together, these data indicate that APPL is required for normal MB axonal outgrowth and that it is required cell-autonomously for the growth of the β-lobe and non-cell autonomously for the growth of α lobe. To verify the specificity of the Appl−/− phenotype, we rescued the defects by restoring APPL expression in αβ neurons. Expression of full-length membrane-bound APPL, but not a secreted form or a form lacking the intracellular domain (ApplΔC), strongly suppresses the β-lobe loss phenotype (Figures 2C–H and S2B). These results indicate that APPL is required as a full-length, membrane-tethered protein and that the intracellular signaling downstream of APPL is necessary for normal β-lobe outgrowth. Interestingly, secreted APPL strongly reduces the loss of the α lobe (Figure S2C and S2D), confirming that APPL acts non-autonomously in α-lobe outgrowth. All together, the results suggest that APPL is a robustness factor for an unknown axon growth signal whereby Appl−/− αβ neurons are at a phenotypic threshold that causes them to fail to grow in approximately 26% of the cases.\n\n         Abelson Kinase Is a Downstream Effector of APPL Required for MB Axon Outgrowth\n         \nTo unravel the mechanism by which APPL supports MB axon outgrowth, we chose to focus on the cell-autonomous function of APPL in the β lobe. A previous study using APPL gain of function indicates that APPL overexpression induces axonal outgrowth that is dependent on Abl kinase activity [25]. We asked whether Abl kinase also acts downstream of APPL during MB β-lobe growth. First, we tested if APPL genetically interacts with Abl. To this end we analyzed the adult MB morphology of Appl−/−; Abl−/+ flies. Loss of one copy of Abelson causes a dramatic increase (up to 51%) in complete (41%) or partial (10%) β-lobe loss, compared to Appl−/− alone (Figure 3A, 3B and 3E, 3F). As controls we analyzed the siblings heterozygous for both Appl and Abl (Appl−/+; Abl−/+) and observed no phenotypes (Figure 3F). Similarly to Appl−/− mutants alone, the phenotypes arise at early developmental stages (Figure S3A). To further confirm that Abl is the downstream mediator of APPL signaling during β-lobe growth, we tested if overexpression of Abl specifically in MB αβ neurons rescues the Appl null phenotype. We find that wild-type Abl, but not a Kinase Dead (Abl-KD) form of Abl, rescues the Appl null phenotype (Figure 3C–F) to the same extent as MB αβ expression of APPL itself (Figure S2B). Taken together these data indicate that Abl is the effector of APPL required for the β-lobe growth. Next, we further characterized the downstream pathway involved.\n\n         APPL Is a Novel Neuronal-Specific Modulator of PCP Signaling\n         \nIt has been recently shown that Abl phosphorylates Disheveled (Dsh), a core intracellular component of the Wnt pathway, on the Tyrosine 473. This modification is required for the efficient activation of the PCP signaling pathway in epithelial cells [26]. Interestingly, in the nervous system the Wnt-PCP pathway is required for robust axonal outgrowth both in Drosophila [27] and mouse [28],[29]. More recently, several PCP pathway components, like the Wnt receptor Frizzled (Fz), Flamingo (Fmi), Strabismus (Stbm or Vang), and Dsh, have been shown to play a role in the correct targeting and bifurcation of MB axons [4],[30],[31]. Indeed, we observe that flies harboring a PCP-specific mutation in Dsh (dsh1) [32] show the same MB developmental defects observed in Appl−/− flies (Figure 4A).\n\nTogether, these observations prompted us to speculate that APPL acts to facilitate Wnt-PCP pathway activation during MB development by mediating Dsh phosphorylation by Abl. To verify this hypothesis we tested if the phosphorylation of Dsh on Y473 is required for MB development. We analyzed dsh1 flies harboring one of two genomic rescue constructs: a wild-type construct (dsh-DshGFP-wt) or a Tyrosine 473 phospho-mutant construct (dsh-DshGFP-Y473F). Whereas the restoration of wild-type Dsh fully rescues the dsh1 MB phenotype (Figures 4B and S4A), DshY473F completely fails to do so (Figures 4C and S4A). To exclude that DshY473F failure to rescue the phenotype is due to a perturbation in the expression pattern resulting from the point mutation, we performed anti-GFP staining on adult brains of both transgenic lines. As shown in Figure 4D and 4E, both wild type and mutant Dsh are expressed in the MB lobes. These results clearly indicate that Abl phosphorylation of Dsh on Tyrosine 473 and the subsequent activation of Wnt-PCP signaling are required for the β-lobe growth.\n\nCollectively, the data suggest the exciting possibility that APPL may be a neuronal-specific component of the Wnt-PCP pathway. To address this issue, we first asked if APPL interacts genetically with core members of the Wnt-PCP pathway like the classical Wnt-PCP receptor Fz and the canonical Wnt-PCP protein Van Gogh/Strabismus (Vang/Stbm). We first analyzed the β-lobe of Appl−/−; Fz−/+ flies. Reduction of Fz in the APPL null background increases the frequency of the β lobe loss up to 21%, whereas no phenotype is observed in control siblings (Figures 5B, E and S5A). This interaction is specific to the MB because expression of a dominant negative form of Fz (Fz-DN) in Appl−/− αβ neurons yields similar results (Figures 5C, 5E and S5A). In both experiments described, the increase in β-lobe loss is relatively mild compared to the dramatic increase in β-lobe loss due to APPL-Abl epistasis for example, suggesting that APPL and Fz may act together for Wnt-PCP activation. To clarify this, we tested if inhibition of Fz alone is sufficient to induce the β phenotype. Overexpression of Fz-DN in αβ neurons of wild-type flies did not cause any morphological defects (Figure S5A and S5B). These data were further confirmed by the analysis of Fz mutant αβ clones of different sizes. None of the analyzed MB clones showed morphologically aberrant axons (Figure S5C). To rule out compensation by Fz2, we examined Fz2 expression in the brain and found that it is not detectable in MB (unpublished data). Furthermore, MARCM clones null for Fz2 alone or Fz and Fz2 together show no aberrant morphology (Figure S5D and S5E). Therefore, APPL function is a critical determinant of the role of PCP in the outgrowth of MB β axons. To further ascertain the interaction with the Wnt-PCP pathway, we analyzed if APPL interacts with the Wnt-PCP four-pass transmembrane protein Vang/Stbm. Reduction of Van Gogh in the Appl null background (Appl−/−;vang−/+) increases the frequency of the β-lobe loss phenotype to 33% (Figures 5D,E and S5A), whereas no phenotype is observed in control siblings. APPL is also expressed in the developing fly retina (Figure S5F), where the PCP pathway regulates the polarity of photoreceptor cells. However, we did not observe defects in photoreceptor polarity (Figure S5G–I), suggesting that the role of APPL in Wnt-PCP signaling is specific to axonal outgrowth. Together, the data above identify APPL as the first neuronal-specific modulator of the Wnt-PCP pathway's role in axonal outgrowth. Next, we analyzed if the expression pattern of Vang and APPL overlaps during MB development. For this purpose, we used a line that expresses a YFP tagged form of Vang under the control of the Actin promoter. As shown in Figure 5F, during the development of the β lobe both APPL and Vang are expressed at a high level in the growing axons. Interestingly, in adult stage, APPL expression is reduced in the rest of the brain and enriched in the αβ neurons while Vang levels are strongly reduced in these axons (Figure 5G). Moreover, in the developing fly retina, APPL and Vang do not colocalize and are found in juxtaposed domains (Figure S5L). Taken together these results suggest that both APPL and Vang are present in developing αβ axons where their genetic interaction is required for the correct development of the β axons. On the contrary, the two proteins are expressed in different compartments in the fly retina where APPL function is not required for PCP activity.\n\nFinally, to confirm that PCP signaling is indeed positively modulated by APPL and that the activation of the signaling is required for the β-lobe growth, we performed rescue experiments with Dsh. As shown in Figure 5F, overexpression of Dsh in the Appl−/− background strongly reduces (7%) the β-lobe loss but does not fully rescue the phenotype. This result indicates that the phosphorylation of Dsh by Abelson is the limiting step in the activation of PCP signaling; increasing the amount of Dsh present in the neurons improves the phenotype, but probably the endogenous Abelson is not sufficient to phosphorylate the whole pool of Dsh. To overcome this problem we decided to enhance the activation of PCP signaling by overexpressing Wnt5 in the Appl−/− background. Interestingly, overexpression of Wnt5 significantly rescues the β-lobe loss (Figure 5H), indicating that the PCP signaling activation is required for the development of the β lobe and is reduced in absence of APPL.\n\n         APP Is Required for Dvl2 Phosphorylation in Response to Wnt5 and Forms Complexes with PCP Core Proteins\n         \nThe previously described results raise two important questions. First, is the interaction between APPL and the Wnt-PCP pathway conserved in mammalian APP proteins? Second, if so, do the genetic interactions observed in Drosophila reflect a biochemical association of APPL/APP with the Wnt-PCP receptors? To address these issues, we first investigated if mouse APP proteins mediate the phosphorylation of mouse Disheveled (Dvl) in response to the Wnt-PCP ligand Wnt5a. To this end, we analyzed Dvl phosphorylation in response to Wnt5a treatment in wild-type versus APP/APLP2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast (dKO MEFs). In WT MEFs, Dvl2 phosphorylation increases dramatically upon treatment with Wnt5a. In contrast, Dvl2 in dKO MEFs completely fails to respond to Wnt5a treatment (Figure 6A). The effect on the activation of Dvl2 is a direct consequence of APP loss because upon reintroduction of APP cDNA Dvl2 phosphorylation is restored (Figure 6A). Next, we tested if APPL and APP interacts with core Wnt-PCP receptor proteins. In particular, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analyses of tagged proteins expressed in HEK-293T cells. As shown in Figures 6B and S6B, APPL immunoprecipitates Vang when the two proteins are co-expressed in the same cells. Drosophila APPL immunoprecipitates human Van Gogh 2 (Vangl2) (Figures 6C and S6C). Importantly, this multiprotein complex can only be detected when the proteins are expressed in the same cells, but not when lysates from separately expressing cells are mixed (Figure S6E). This observation also accounts for the absence of rescue observed when a form of APPL lacking the C terminal is expressed in the Appl−/− animals (Figure 2H). Similarly, the membrane tethered C-terminus of human APP (APP-C99) immunoprecipitates Vangl2 (Figures 6D and S6D). Moreover, we tested if APPL also immunoprecipitates other PCP receptors like Fz. As shown in Figures 6E and S6F, APPL immunoprecipitates Fz, suggesting that the core PCP proteins and APPL might form a multiprotein complex on the membrane, responsible for the efficient activation of the pathway. Similarly, the membrane-tethered C-terminus of human APP (APP-C99) immunoprecipitates human Fzd5 (Figure 6F).\n\n      Discussion\n      \nAD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of neurons in specific regions of the brain that correlates with progressive impairment of higher cognitive functions. A growing body of evidence identifies the APP and its metabolite the Aβ peptide as main players in the pathogenesis of AD. In particular, the accumulation of Aβ peptides in the brain seems to be the trigger of the pathological cascade that eventually results in neuronal loss and degeneration [33]. Despite efforts to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ's toxic function, it is still not clear what triggers the accumulation of the peptide and how this is correlated with the pathogenesis of the disease and the dementia. In fact, most of the work done to unveil the pathogenesis of the disease has focused on the analysis of Aβ-peptide and the search for its receptors and downstream effectors. Even though the numerous in vitro studies performed in cell culture identified several molecules that interact with Aβ peptide, the in vivo biological relevance of these interactions remains to be clarified. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has also dominated the search for AD treatments, but the promising molecular candidates developed to modulate the Aβ peptide and reached clinical trials failed [34],[35]. Finally, over the last few years many studies indicated that there is no linear correlation between the accumulation of the peptide and the cognitive decline, leading to a revision of the amyloidogenic hypothesis. Taken together, these observations suggest that the accumulation of the peptide is not the only cause of the pathology and that other factors are involved. Interestingly, under physiological conditions APP is mainly found in its uncleaved or α-cleaved form, suggesting that the shift towards amyloidogenic processing not only increases the production of Aβ peptide but also depletes the pool of APP that undergoes non-amyloidogenic processing, with hitherto unknown consequences. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the physiological role of APP and how perturbing this role could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. An important contribution to the study of the function of a protein comes from the analysis of the knock-out (KO) animals. In the case of APP, several KO models have been generated and analyzed in detail both from the morphological and behavioral point of view [13],[36]–[38]. Despite these efforts, the normal physiological function of APP in vivo in the nervous system remains largely elusive and highly controversial. This is due to the lack of consensus over the neuronal phenotypes in null mutant animals and the mechanism of action in vivo. The data collected by different labs confirmed the involvement of APPs in development and function of the nervous system, but these studies do not provide an in-depth analysis of the development of the brain during the pre-natal stages or the molecular mechanism underlying APPs' putative functions. We therefore took advantage of Drosophila melanogaster to further analyze the consequence of loss of APP Like (APPL) during brain development.\n\nIn the present study we demonstrate that APPL is involved in brain development of Drosophila melanogaster, particularly in the Mushroom Body (MB) neurons. We show that APPL is required for the development of αβ neurons. In Appl−/− flies, MB neurons fail to project the α lobe in 14% of the cases and the β-lobe in 12% of the cases (Figure 1). Further analysis of the phenotype reveals that APPL is required cell-autonomously for the development of the β lobe and non-cell autonomously for the development of the α lobe. In fact, single cell Appl−/− clones display only β-lobe loss and no α loss. The re-introduction of a full-length, membrane-tethered form of APPL, but not a soluble form, rescues β-lobe loss (Figure 2). This is of particular interest because it confirms that, similar to mammalian APPs, the physiological role of APPL is mediated both by its full-length form, required in the neurons to achieve the correct β-lobe pattern, and by its soluble form (sAPPL) that regulates the extension of the α lobe. Moreover, the rescue data indicate that, at least in this context, the function of sAPPL is mediated not by homo-dimerization with the full-length form but by some other receptor, hitherto unknown. Further experiments are required to clarify the sAPPL non-cell autonomous effect, but we hypothesize that it might be involved in modulating signaling mediated by the cells that surround the MB axons. Taken together, the analysis of the Appl−/− animals confirmed the important role of APPs during brain development but reinforced the idea that the phenotypes are present with incomplete penetrance and might be subtle. It would therefore be of interest to analyze the phenotype of the KO mice in greater detail and, in particular, to better characterize the APP's downstream pathway leading to these defects.\n\nMoreover, the results described clearly support a model of APPL as a novel, neuronal-specific positive modulator of the Wnt-PCP pathway (Figure 4). The PCP pathway was initially described because of its role in tissue polarity establishment and, in particular, of its regulation of cell orientation in plane of an epithelium. Among the different processes regulated by PCP signaling, we are interested in axon growth and guidance. It has been described that mice null for Fzd3/Ceslr3−/− genes show severe defects in several major axon tracts like thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and nigrostriatal tracts, defects of the anterior commissure, and similarly to APP KO mice, the variable loss of the corpus callosum [5],[39].\n\nThe molecular mechanism underlying the function of PCP-signaling in regulating tissue polarity has been broadly studied. The current model suggests that, upon polarized expression of the different core proteins, Dsh is recruited to the membrane via Fz and leads to the activation of a cascade of small GTPases finally resulting in cytoskeleton rearrangements. In the case of regulation of axon growth and guidance, it is less clear how the signaling is regulated and transmitted to the cytoskeleton. A recent publication suggested that during axon growth the transmembrane PCP receptor-like Vang and Fzd are localized at the growth cone area on the tip of the fillopodia, thus suggesting that in this context the asymmetric localization is not needed [28].\n\nFurthermore, Dsh needs to relocalize from the cytoplasm to the membrane to ensure the proper activation of PCP signaling, and this is dependent on its phosphorylation status. Singh and colleagues showed that Abelson is one kinase responsible for this modification, but the receptor upstream of the kinase was not identified [26]. Based on the evidence we generated, we propose that APPL is a novel regulator of Wnt-PCP pathway involved in axon growth and guidance (Figure 7). This is of interest because while the PCP core proteins are ubiquitously expressed, APPL is restricted to the nervous system, suggesting that it could be the first described tissue-specific modulator of the pathway.\n\nMechanistically, we propose that APPL-Abl complex modulates Dsh via dual protein-protein interactions. First, Abl might have an intrinsic affinity for its substrate Dsh [26]. Secondly, this interaction is strengthened or stabilized by the inclusion of APPL in a PCP receptor complex. This dual affinity complex leads to increased PCP signaling efficiency at the developing growth cone. Both biochemical and physiological data show that this function is highly conserved in mammalian APP, suggesting that it may play a similar role in the mammalian brain. The canonical-Wnt signaling pathway has already been connected to AD pathogenesis because of its link to the tau-kinase GSK-3β. Interestingly, no clear link between the Wnt-PCP pathway and this neurodegenerative disorder has been made. Previous reports [27],[28] show that, in flies and mice, Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) is the final effector of PCP in axon outgrowth and JNK was shown to be required for the effect of APP overexpression in the fly [25],[40]. Interestingly, JNK signaling has also been linked to the neuronal loss observed in AD [41]. It is therefore worth investigating whether the physiological function of APP as a neuronal PCP modulator explains the JNK-AD connection.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n         Fly Stocks\n         \nDrosophila stocks used include Appld w*, Appld,FRT19A w*, elavC155,hsFLP,w*;UAS-mCD8::GFP.,UAS-lacZ/CyO;tubP-GAL80,FRT2A/TM6,Tb,Hu, hsFlp,UAS-CD8-GFP;;FRT2A,tubGal80/TM3;OK107, hsFlp, UAS-CD8-GFP; FRT2A, tubGal80/TM3;OK107, Flp122; sp/CyO;Fz p21,ri,FRT2A/TM2, fz2C1ri,FRT2A/TM3,Sb, yw,hsflip;Fz1H51Fz2C1riFRT2A/TM2, UAS-Fz-DN/CyO;P247Gal4/TM6c, UAS-Abl-KD/CyO;P247Gal.

The samples were subsequently rinsed three times in PBT and blocked in PAX-DG for 1 h. Following these steps, the brains were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in PAX-DG overnight at 4°C. This incubation was followed by three washes with PBT and a subsequent incubation with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies for 2 h at RT. After three rinses in PBT, the brains were put in 50% Glycerol diluted in PBS and then mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) mounting medium. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, 1∶1,000), mouse anti-FasII (Hybridoma Bank, 1∶50), rabbit anti-APP-C-term (kind gift of Bart de Strooper lab, 1∶5,000), and anti-Phalloidin TRITC (1∶1,000).\n\n         Microscopy and Image Analysis\n         \nThe mounted brains were imaged either on a LEICA DM 6000 CS microscope coupled to a LEICA CTR 6500 confocal system or on a Nikon A1-R confocal (Nikon) mounted on a Nikon Ti-2000 inverted microscope (Nikon) and equipped with 405, 488, 561, and 639 nm lasers from Melles Griot. The pictures were then processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop.\n\n         MARCM Procedure\n         \nCrosses were set up at 25°C and transferred every day. We transferred 0 to 24 pupae in a fresh vial, and they were heath shocked for 45′ at 37°C and shifted back at 25°C until eclosion. The morphology of the MB clones was analyzed in flies 0–7 d old.\n\n         Cell Culture and Treatments\n         \nWT MEFs, APP/APLP2 double KO MEFs, APP/APLP2 double KO+hAPP, and HEK-293T cells were propagated in DMEM, 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin. MEFs (200,000 cells per well) were seeded in 24-well plates for biochemical analyses. MEFs were treated 2 d after seeding with rmWnt5a (R&amp;D Systems) for 2 h. Cells were harvested for immunoblotting by direct lysis in 1× Laemmli buffer followed by boiling at 95°C for 5 min. Control stimulations were done with 0.1% BSA in PBS.\n\n         Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blots\n         \nProtein from total cell lysates/samples was resolved in 10% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) under denaturing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed using polyclonal anti-FLAG M2 (F1804, Sigma-Aldrich 1∶1,000), monoclonal anti-Myc (M4439,Sigma-Aldrich 1∶1,000), anti-Dvl1 (sc-8025, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, 1∶1,000), anti-Dvl2 (#3224, Cell Signaling Technologies, 1∶1,000), anti-V5 (R960-25, Invitrogen, 1∶1,000), anti-HA (HA.11, MMS-101R, Covance, 1∶2,000), and anti-beta-actin (sc-1615, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1∶2,000). Bands were visualized using anti-IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, UK).\n\n         Co-Immunoprecipitation\n         \nFor the Co-IP of Drosophila proteins, pCDNA3-APPL-FLAG and pCDNA3-Vang-Myc were transiently transfected in HEK293T cells (4.5×106 cells per 10 cm dish) using Fugene HD (Roche). After 3 d, cells were collected in Lysis Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.4% Nonidet P-40) and cleared with Dynabeads M-270 epoxy (Invitrogen) for 45′ at 4°C. After the clearing, lysates (half volume) were incubated with anti-FLAG covalently conjugated to Dynabeads M-270 (pre-saturated with BSA) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were then washed, and bound proteins were resuspended in 6× Laemmli and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. For the Co-IP of Drosophila and human proteins, HEK293 cells grown at 50% confluency on 10-cm plates were transfected with 6 µg of each plasmid. After 2 d, cells were lysed for 15 min in 1 ml of lysis buffer ([0 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40 supplemented with 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, cat. no. 11836145001)]. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,200× g for 20 min at 4°C, supernatants were collected, and 0.4 ml of the supernatant was incubated with 1 µg of indicated immunoprecipitating antibody for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were collected on Protein G sepharose beads by overnight rotation, washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation include FLAG M2 (F1804 Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA (ab9110; Abcam), anti-Myc (M4439, Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-V5 (R960-25, Invitrogen).\n\n      Supporting Information"
