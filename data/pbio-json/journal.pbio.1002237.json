  "fullText": "The authors would like to clarify that for some of the actin RNA loading control panels in Figure 2A and those in Figure 6A, a temporary placeholder was left in inadvertently. In Figure 2A, actin RNA was not assayed for pc9, as this phage display peptide was used as a negative control that failed to inhibit cytokine mRNA induction by SEB. Since equal amounts of RNA were loaded for electrophoretic analysis, the conclusion remains valid. Figure 6A now displays the actual actin RNA panels. tk2 mutant SEB is impaired in its ability to induce cytokine gene expression; reduced cytokine mRNA levels are reflected by reduced protein levels.\n\nCorrected versions of Figs 2 &amp; 6 are included here."
