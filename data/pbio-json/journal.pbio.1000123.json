  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nWith more than 100 billion red blood cells generated every day, the erythroid lineage has the largest quantitative output of cell production in adult mammals. This impressive capability requires a pattern of cell proliferation closely related to that of embryonic cells followed by ultimate inhibition of cell division, when terminal erythroid differentiation is completed. Yet, the putative molecular pathways that coordinate cell proliferation and erythroid differentiation remain obscure. The transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for erythroid differentiation as it transactivates all the known erythroid-specific genes upon binding to specific DNA motifs [1],[2]. GATA-1 also exerts a repressive action on a subset of genes [3], and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation [4],[5]. The cofactor Friend-of-GATA-1 (FOG-1) binds to GATA-1 [6] and modulates its activity on given target genes, and mice deficient in either GATA-1 [7],[8] or FOG-1 [9] die from severe anemia. Perturbation of the cell proliferation machinery also commonly results in lethal fetal anemia, as seen in mice defective in pRb [10]–[12], the three cyclins D together [13], more than one E2F members or Cdk4/6 [14],[15]. With respect to the role of pRb in erythropoiesis during development, conflicting views persist as to its cell-autonomous (intrinsic) or nonautonomous (extrinsic) nature, the latter involving the accessory contribution of macrophages [16] or even the placenta [17] as the primary cause for embryonic lethality. Yet, other studies support the existence of a cell-autonomous component for pRb in erythropoiesis, although the underlying molecular pathways remain unknown [18]–[21]. Particularly puzzling is the phenotypic paradox of mutations of the GATA-1 gene that result in the synthesis of an N-terminally truncated GATA-1 protein (GATA-1s) [22]. In a family of patients with an inherited mutation of the GATA-1 gene that results in GATA-1s expression, a severe anemia occurs [23]. In contrast, patients with the Down syndrome (trisomy 21) are prone to cellular selection of acquired somatic GATA-1 mutations that produce GATA-1s and result in preleukemic myeloproliferative disorders [24].\n\nHere, we provide evidence of a direct physical interaction between pRb/E2F-2 and GATA-1 and document its physiological significance. We have also uncovered a potentially novel function for FOG-1 as a regulator of pRb for the control of cell proliferation. This direct interplay between GATA-1, FOG-1, pRb, and E2F sheds a new light on a constellation of mouse phenotypes and human syndromes that implicate mutations of the Rb or GATA-1 genes.\n\nResults\n\nDirect Interaction between GATA-1 and pRb Requires the Integrity of a LXCXE Motif\n\nBy examining the coding sequence of human GATA-1 (hGATA-1), we have identified an LNCME motif located at amino acid positions 81 to 85. This sequence exactly matches the consensus LXCXE motif present in many cellular or viral pRb-binding proteins [25],[26]. Peptidic alignment of all known GATA-1 orthologs shows the presence of the LXCXE or its variant LXSXE in all species (Figure 1A). Serine is structurally similar to cysteine but contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group in place of the thiol (-SH) group. Neither of these two motifs (LXCXE and LXSXE) is present in any of the other members of the GATA family (i.e., GATA-2 to -6; unpublished data). To probe for the functionality of this putative Rb-binding domain in hGATA-1 in vivo, NIH-3T3 cells, which do not express GATA-1, were transduced with retroviral vectors that encode either mGATA-1 or hGATA1. Cross coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis with GATA-1 and pRb (p110) specific antibodies (Abs) confirmed the hypothesis that pRb is associated with h/mGATA-1 in this reconstituted model (Figure S1A), thus suggesting that both LXCXE and LXSXE motifs are functional within the GATA-1 proteins for pRb binding. To demonstrate that pRb/hGATA-1 interaction is specifically dependent upon the LNCME motif, NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors that express either (1) hGATA-1, (2) a naturally occurring N-terminally truncated form of hGATA-1, referred to as hGATA-1s (“s” for “short” [24]), which is initiated at methionine 84 within the LNCM84E motif, or (3) hGATA-1 bearing two amino acid substitutions within the LNCME motif (LNCME to LNGMK; referred to as hGATA-1Rb−) (Figure 1A). Cross co-IP with GATA-1– and pRb-specific Abs showed that only wild-type (wt) hGATA-1 interacts with pRb, whereas hGATA-1Rb− and hGATA-1s do not (Figure 1B), thus establishing that the LNCME motif in hGATA-1 is required for direct association of pRb to GATA-1. In all the aforementioned co-IP experiments, potential immunoglobulin (Ig) artifacts were ruled out by analyzing IgG isotype controls for all the Abs used and for each GATA-1 variant expressed, under the same experimental conditions (Figure S1B).\n\nMolecular Composition of the GATA-1/pRb Complex: Presence of E2F-2 and Absence of FOG-1\n\nBecause pRb activity is regulated by phosphorylation, we analyzed the pRb phosphorylation status within the GATA-1/pRb complex in erythroid (UT7) and nonerythroid (NIH3T3) cells. There are 16 possible CDK phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr-Pro motifs) in pRB. By western blot analysis, Rb proteins segregate into two distinctly clustered groups of migrating bands: the more slowly migrating correspond to the so-called “hyperphosphorylated” forms, whereas the faster migrating are the “hypophosphorylated” forms, without defined species phosphorylated on specific residues among the 16 always present. Co-IP with an anti–GATA-1 Ab followed by western blot analysis with an anti-pRb Ab indicated that only the hypophosphorylated (“p”) forms of pRb were involved in the GATA-1/pRb complex, while one could detect both hypophosphorylated and (“pp”) hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb by IP of the original sample with an anti-pRb antibody (Figure 1B). Because available pRb antibodies are notoriously fastidious at differentiating hypo- from hyperphosphorylated pRb with optimal clarity, an additional experiment was performed by means of antibodies to phospho-pRb. Co-IP was first performed with specific phospho-pRb antibodies (Pser780, Pser807/811, or Pser795) before resolution by western blot analysis reacted with a GATA-1 antibody. We found that GATA-1 was not precipitated under these conditions (Figure 1C).\n\nBecause hypophosphorylated pRb is known to bind members of the E2F family and actively suppress their transcriptional activity, whereas it has been recently reported that only E2F-2—among all the E2F members present in end-stage (CD71+, TER119+) fetal liver erythroid cells—directly interacts with pRb (p110) [20], we investigated whether E2F-2 is present within the GATA-1/pRb complex. To this end, we purified CD71+ erythroid cells (&gt;90% TER119+) from embryonic day (E)12.5 mouse fetal liver. We first established that all Abs used were efficient and specific by immunoprecipitation (IP) and western blot analysis and that signals were not Ig artifacts (IgG isotype controls), especially for GATA-1 proteins that migrate at levels similar to heavy Ig chains (50 kDa) (Figure S2B). Results of co-IP experiments demonstrated that GATA-1, pRb, and E2F-2 do exist as a tricomplex in nuclear extracts from purified E12.5 mouse fetal liver erythroid cells (Figure S2C and S2D).\n\nTo further characterize the molecular composition of the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex, we performed a co-IP assay with an Ab specific for E2F-2 followed by western blot analysis reacted with Abs specific for either pRb, GATA-1, or FOG-1, the known partner of GATA-1. Whereas GATA-1 and pRb proteins could be identified within the E2F-2 immunoprecipitate, FOG-1 was not found (Figure 1D). As we previously demonstrated that GATA-1 is directly associated with pRb and that GATA-1 is not known to bind directly to E2F-2, we can thus surmise that two pRb complexes can possibly coexist in nuclear extracts from fetal liver erythroid cells: pRb/E2F-2 and GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2. To probe whether the presence of E2F-2 is required for GATA-1/pRb complex formation, we first performed an immunodepletion of E2F-2 followed by western blot analysis of the unbound fraction with GATA-1 or pRb specific Abs (Figure S2E). Results indicate that both GATA-1 and pRb could be detected in the unbound fraction (Figure 1D and S2D). The E2F-2 immunodepleted fraction was then submitted to secondary co-IPs with Abs specific for either pRb, GATA-1, or FOG-1. Secondary IP precipitates were resolved by western blot analysis with Abs specific for either E2F-2, pRb, GATA-1 or FOG-1. An association between pRb and GATA-1 could not be detected in the E2F-2 unbound fraction (Figure 1D).\n\nFrom these series of experiments, we can conclude that (1) a GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex, in which pRb is hypophosphorylated, is present in late-stage erythroid cells from mouse fetal livers, (2) the GATA-1 LXCXE motif is required for direct association of pRb/E2F-2 to GATA-1, (3) GATA-1 and pRb do not form a bicomplex in the absence of E2F-2, (4) only E2F-2, but no other form of E2F present in these erythroid cells, allows measurable GATA-1/pRb/E2F tricomplex formation, and (5) FOG-1 is excluded from the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex.\n\nFOG-1 Interferes with the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 Association and Displaces pRb from GATA-1 by Direct Protein–Protein Interaction\n\nBefore addressing the physiological relevance of these findings, we first probed the apparent paradox that FOG-1 is known to be a key cofactor of GATA-1 in erythroid cells, whereas we have now established that FOG-1 is excluded from the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex. Although the amino acid residues of GATA-1 known to interact with FOG-1 lie within a zinc finger domain located outside the LNCME motif [27],[28], we investigated whether FOG-1 could, nevertheless, regulate the formation of the tricomplex. To this end, we generated pure populations of NIH3T3 cells that express hGATA-1 after retroviral transfer, in which we subsequently transiently transfected various amounts of a plasmid that expresses human FOG-1 (hFOG-1). We chose NIH3T3 cells because they constitutively express E2F proteins, including E2F-2, although they do not naturally express GATA-1 or FOG-1 in the absence of transfection. Co-IP assays showed that hFOG-1 was able, in a dose-dependant manner, to prevent hGATA-1 from forming a complex with pRb (Figure 2A). To assess whether a direct protein–protein interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1 is required to dissociate pRb from GATA-1, we expressed relevant mutants of hGATA-1 and hFOG-1 in NIH3T3 cells following an identical experimental approach. We made use of the hGATA-1V205G mutant, which comprises a point mutation that substitutes a glycine for a valine at codon 205. This mutation, naturally found in patients and previously studied in mice, is associated with severe dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia [28],[29]. It was previously established that this mutation causes the disruption of GATA-1 binding to FOG-1 and, as a consequence, a failure of expression of genes dependent on GATA-1 for their transactivation as well as the lack of repression of the c-Myc and GATA-2 genes [30]. We thus expressed hGATA-1, hGATA-1Rb−, or hGATA-1V205G in NIH-3T3 cells by retroviral transfer followed by transient transfection of a plasmid that expresses hFOG-1. Co-IP revealed that hFOG-1 was unable to dissociate hGATA-1V205G from pRb in contrast to hGATA-1 (Figure 2B). As a corroborating demonstration, we used a compensatory hFOG-1 mutant (hFOG-1S706R) that is able to bind to hGATA-1V205G and rescue the erythroid maturation of GATA-1−/− cells expressing hGATA-1V205G [30]. Co-IP assays showed that hFOG-1S706R was able to trigger a partial dissociation of hGATA-1V205G from pRb (Figure 2B). The residual association of hGATA-1V205G to pRb in the presence of hFOG-1S706R is likely to result from the lower affinity of hFOG-1S706R for hGATA-1V205G compared to that of hFOG-1 for hGATA-1 (Figure 2B and [30]).\n\nAltogether, we thus conclude that FOG-1 is capable of displacing pRb/E2F from GATA-1 in vitro by direct GATA-1/FOG-1 interaction. An equilibrium model between GATA-1, pRb, E2F-2, and FOG-1 is proposed (Figure 2C).\n\nCell Proliferation Is Controlled by Differential Association of GATA-1 to FOG-1 or pRb\n\nAs GATA-1 overexpression is known to inhibit cell growth [4],[5], we then set out to study the putative role of the GATA-1/pRb/E2F complex on cell proliferation. Because erythroid cells naturally express both GATA-1 and FOG-1, thus making it difficult to dissect the respective contribution of each of the factors and to decouple their effects on proliferation per se versus terminal erythroid cell differentiation, we first chose to establish a reconstituted cellular model after forced expression of wt and mutant GATA-1 proteins together with their corresponding FOG-1 interacting partners in the nonerythroid NIH3T3 cell line. We monitored, every day for 4 d, the growth of NIH-3T3 cells transduced with retroviral vectors that express either hGATA-1 or hGATA-1Rb−. Because hGATA-1 and hGATA-1Rb− proteins were expressed at similar levels in transduced cells (Figure 1B) with undistinguishable transcriptional activity (Figure S3), this assay becomes relevant. Whereas hGATA-1 expression impaired NIH-3T3 cell proliferation, as previously reported [5], we found that hGATA-1Rb− had no effect on it (Figures 3A and S4). Because pRb/E2F has been shown to be necessary to the G1/S transition [25],[26], we investigated whether the cellular distribution of phases of the cell cycle would be altered by the GATA-1/pRb/E2F association. NIH3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors constitutively expressing either hGATA-1 or hGATA-1Rb−. Transduced NIH3T3 (eGFP-positive) cells were then starved in 1% serum (cell synchronization) for 72 h, and cell cycle progression was studied after stimulation in 10% serum at Day 2. As previously described [5], expression of GATA-1 blocked the cell cycle at the G1/S transition, whereas hGATA-1Rb− expression did not (Figure 3B).\n\nTo clarify the role of pRb in the observed GATA-1–dependent impairment of cell growth, we knocked down pRb expression in the transduced NIH-3T3 cells by transient transfection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against pRb. Consistent with our expectation, GATA-1–mediated inhibition of cell growth was abrogated for 2 d before cells ultimately stopped proliferating as the inhibitory effect of the siRNA vanished (Figure S5A). pRb knock-down by siRNA was concurrently assessed by western blot analysis, which indicated that complete inhibition of pRb expression occurred only during the first 2 d after siRNA transfection (Figure S5B) without interference with the expression of p107 (Figure S5C). When the same experiment was performed with the human osteogenic sarcoma SAOS-2 cell line, which does not express endogenous GATA-1 or pRb, neither retrovirally expressed hGATA-1 nor hGATA-1Rb− had an effect on cell proliferation (Figure S5D). These results together establish that direct interaction of pRb to GATA-1 through its LXCXE motif is central to the antiproliferative effect of GATA-1.\n\nWe then focused on the putative role of FOG-1 in this process. NIH-3T3 cells constitutively expressing hGATA-1 after retroviral transduction were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of a hFOG-1 expression plasmid and cell proliferation monitored for 5 d. hFOG-1 relieved the growth inhibitory effect of hGATA-1 for NIH-3T3 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). When the same experiment was performed with the non–FOG-1–interacting mutant hGATA-1V205G instead of hGATA-1, hFOG-1 was unable to counteract the inhibition of NIH-3T3 cell proliferation mediated by hGATA-1V205G at the displacing dose of FOG-1 established for hGATA-1 (Figure 3D). When hFOG-1S706R was combined with hGATA-1V205G in a similar experiment, rescue of cell proliferation was observed albeit only partially (Figure 3D), consistent with the lower affinity of hFOG-1S706R for hGATA-1V205G compared to that of hFOG-1 for hGATA-1 (Figure 2B and [30]).\n\nTo establish the relevance of these finding for erythroid cells, we made use of the erythroid cell line G1E, which is blocked at the proerythroblast stage and derives from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with complete biallelic inactivation of the endogenous GATA-1 genes (GATA-1−/−) [31]. G1E and NIH3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vector constitutively expressing either hGATA1, hGATA-1Rb−, hGATA-1V205G, or hGATA-1V205GRb−. The hGATA-1V205G mutant and the double hGATA-1V205GRb− mutant were included in this study in an effort to decouple effects on cell proliferation per se versus terminal erythroid cell differentiation, which is known to be dependant upon GATA-1/FOG-1 interaction and would here confuse data interpretation since G1E cells naturally express FOG-1. In agreement with the conclusion we reached in reconstituted NIH3T3 cells, the various GATA-1 forms behaved similarly in G1E and NIH3T3 cells (i.e., inhibition of cell proliferation with hGATA1 and hGATA-1V205G, as opposed to maintenance of cell proliferation with hGATA-1Rb− and hGATA-1V205GRb−) (Figure 4A and 4B). However, the rate of cell proliferation was lower in the G1E cell population in the presence of the hGATA-1Rb− mutant as compared to G1E cells expressing the double hGATA-1V205GRb− mutant and NIH3T3 cells expressing either of these single or double mutants, in agreement with findings discussed in the subsequent section that the hGATA-1Rb− mutant induces partial terminal erythroid differentiation of the G1E cell population through GATA-1/FOG-1 complex formation. Taken together, these findings establish a novel function for FOG-1 and point to the role of the GATA-1/FOG-1 association as a potential molecular rheostat to regulate the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by GATA-1. However, G1E cells transduced with a retroviral vector that expresses GATA-1s hyperproliferate (Figure 4C). This suggests that hGATA-1Rb−, and hGATA-1s are not functionally equivalent.\n\nForced Expression of hGATA-1Rb− Fails to Induce Proper Terminal Erythroid Differentiation of GATA-1−/− Cells\n\nSince pRb has been implicated in the differentiation processes of several cell types [16],[26], in addition to its role in cell cycle control, we then investigated whether the interaction between pRb and GATA-1 is involved in the differentiation of erythroid cells. To this end, we returned to the erythroid cell line G1E. Retrovirus-mediated expression of hGATA-1 in G1E cells induced terminal erythroid differentiation of cells positive for coexpression of vector-encoded eGFP, as evidenced by May-Grünwald-Giemsa and benzidine staining for identification and scoring of the various red blood cell precursors (Figure 5A and 5B). In contrast, forced expression of hGATA-1Rb− dramatically altered the distribution of erythroid precursors towards the more immature elements, although the initiation of erythroid differentiation was not impaired (Figure 5A and 5B). The same results were obtained with another erythroid cell line, referred to as GAK14 (M. Yamamoto, unpublished data), which was independently developed from mouse GATA-1.05 ES cells (Figure S6A). To determine more precisely the cell composition of G1E-transduced (eGFP positive) cells, erythropoietic maturation was assessed 6 d after transduction by cytofluorometry for c-Kit, CD71, and TER119 expression. Although the complete loss of c-Kit expression in both hGATA-1– and hGATA-1Rb−–transduced G1E cells indicated that erythroid differentiation was initiated normally in either case, quantification of CD71−TER119hi (41% vs. 0%) and CD71hiTER119− (2% vs. 72%), respectively, showed that terminal erythroid differentiation was impaired in hGATA-1Rb− G1E cells (Figure 5C). GATA-1Rb− G1E cells were able to progress to an intermediate (CD71hiTER119lo) stage like hGATA-1 G1E cells (25% vs. 16%, respectively, Figure 5C), but hGATA-1 G1E cells differentiated further. A similar conclusion was reached by morphological identification and scoring of the various red blood cell precursors of the retrovirally transduced GAK14 cell line (Figure S6B).\n\nTo study the potential effects of the interplay between GATA-1, pRb/E2F, and FOG-1 upon the differentiation of erythroid cells, we analyzed by flow cytometry the phenotypes of G1E cells expressing hGATA-1, hGATA-1V205G, or hGATA-1V205GRb− after retroviral vector transduction (Figure 5C). Whereas hGATA-1–expressing cells became c-Kit−, CD71+, and TER119+, both hGATA-1V205G and hGATA-1V205GRb− expressing cells failed to express TER119 and continued to express c-Kit. These data indicate that it is the GATA-1/FOG-1 association, but not the GATA-1/pRb/E2F complex, which is required for the down-expression of c-Kit during the early stage of proerythroblast differentiation.\n\nDirect Interaction of GATA-1 with pRb Is Necessary for Terminal Erythropoiesis In Vivo\n\nTo assess the putative physiological effects of the protein–protein interaction between GATA-1 and pRb in a whole animal, we performed a transgenic complementation rescue assay [32]. Because the GATA-1 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is randomly inactivated in every cell, neither homozygous GATA-1−/GATA-1− females nor hemizygous GATA-1−/Y males are viable. We thus made use of mice that carry a mutant GATA-1 allele, referred to as GATA-1.05, which expresses only 5% of GATA-1 wt levels. As previously shown, male GATA-1.05/Y mice die in utero from impaired hematopoiesis, whereas heterozygous female mice (GATA-1.05/X) spontaneously recover shortly after birth from embryonic/fetal and neonatal anemia [32]. In preparation for crossing experiments with these female mice, we generated transgenic (Tg) lines of mice that express either hGATA-1Rb− or its wt counterpart hGATA-1 under the control of transcriptional regulatory sequences referred to as GATA-1 hematopoietic regulatory domain (HRD). HRD-driven transcription is known to recapitulate the endogenous GATA-1 gene expression pattern in both primitive and definitive erythroid lineages of Tg mice [1]. We focused on two of the hGATA-1Rb−–expressing lines (Tg Lines 2 and 5), because expression of the hGATA-1Rb− transgene was at a level equivalent to that of the endogenous mouse GATA-1 gene (Figure 6A). Mouse Tg line 8 was also analyzed as an example of supraphysiologic expression of the hGATA-1Rb− transgene (level 280% that of the endogenous mouse GATA-1 gene). Males of these Tg mice were then mated with heterozygous GATA-1.05/X females, and their male progeny, referred to as 1.05/Y+hGATA-1Rb− and 1.05/Y+hGATA-1, studied. The expected and the observed pup numbers of XGATA-1.05/Y mice harboring the transgene are indicated in Figure 6B. The first observation we made is that the control hGATA-1 transgene could fully rescue GATA-1.05/Y male mice from lethality. Although some of the 1.05/Y+hGATA-1 male embryos showed a slightly anemic appearance at E13.5, most were indistinguishable from wt littermate embryos (Figure 6C). Importantly, their erythropoiesis caught up during late gestation, and viable pups were born with the expected Mendelian distribution (15 rescued out of 133 pups). In contrast, 1.05/Y+hGATA-1Rb− males from either Tg Line 5 (0 rescued out of 45 pups) or Tg Line 2 (0 rescued out of 47 pups) suffered from profound anemia and small size at E12.5–E13.5 leading to embryonic lethality for all animals around E15.5 of development (Figure 6C). In contrast and as expected from previous studies of other GATA mutants, mice from Tg Line 8, which expressed supraphysiologic levels of hGATA-1Rb−, were indistinguishable from wt littermate embryos. This observation underscores the importance of studying the phenotypic effects of mutant GATA transgenes within a physiologic range of expression for this type of transgenic mouse approach (see Discussion).\n\nFlow cytometry analysis for c-Kit and TER119 expression of liver cells from 1.05/Y+hGATA-1Rb− male E13.5 embryos generated from either Lines 2 or 5 showed a decrease in the proportion of mature erythroid cells and late erythroid precursors with concurrent increase in that of early precursors, comparatively to wt littermate embryos (24% vs. 81%− for TER119high c-Kitlow and 30% vs. 8% for TER119− c-Kithigh, respectively), indicating a severe delay in erythroid maturation (Figure 7A). No significant delay was observed in 1.05/Y+hGATA-1 embryos at E13.5 (unpublished data). The liver of E15.5 embryos also contained abnormal erythroid precursors with lobulated nuclei (Figure 7B). Staining of fetal liver sections for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed an increased number of mitotic cells (Figure 7C). Red blood cells harvested from the intracardiac space of E15.5 GATA-1Rb− embryos showed defective erythroid terminal differentiation illustrated by a significant proportion of nucleated cells with defects in nuclear condensation (Figure 7D) and a mild increase in the number of apoptotic cells (Figure 7E). Furthermore, analysis of CD71-positive cells showed a mild accumulation of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle (Figure 7F). These features share striking similarities to those observed in the fetal liver cells of pRb−/− mice [33] and with our data obtained with transduced G1E and GAK14 cell lines (Figures 5 and S6, respectively).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have shown here that (1) direct protein–protein interaction between GATA-1 and pRb is required for normal terminal erythroid differentiation in vitro and in vivo, (2) in late-stage erythroid cells from mouse fetal liver, GATA-1 associates, through a LXCXE motif, with hypophosphorylated pRb engaged with E2F-2 to form a GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tri-complex, (3) GATA-1 and pRb do not form a bicomplex in the absence of E2F-2, (4) the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex inhibits the proliferation of erythroid precursors (5) the association of GATA-1 to pRb/E2F alters G1-to-S phase progression and (6) FOG-1 is capable of displacing pRb/E2F-2 in vitro from the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex. The physiological relevance of this latter observation needs to be further investigated.\n\nA mechanism by which GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex induces cell cycle arrest during erythroid differentiation is likely to be, at least in part, by sequestering E2F within a complex in which pRb is in its hypophosphorylated form. FOG-1 is able to displace GATA-1 away from the complex, and this may then allow E2F-2 to be liberated upon subsequent phosphorylation of pRb. In parallel, the GATA-1/FOG-1 complex exerts its transcriptional effects as part of the program of erythroid differentiation, as exemplified by the extinction of c-Kit expression. Fine-tuning by exogenous inducers is likely to operate, as pRb and GATA-1 are regulated by phosphorylation [34]. This study does not yet address the possibility that the GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 tricomplex possesses specific transcriptional activity in addition to the mere sequestration of E2F-2. For instance, GATA-1/pRb/E2F-2 may activate or inhibit E2F target genes transcription by (1) displacing other pRb-associated LXCXE proteins, (2) increasing gene transactivation through the GATA-1 transactivator domain, (3) acting as a protein platform for other associated GATA-1 proteins (e.g., acetyltransferase P300/CBP, PU.1, EKLF). Preliminary chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, using a GATA-1–specific Ab for ChIP, indicate that known E2F targets genes such as Cdc6 [35] can be detected (unpublished data). Transcriptional studies and cDNA microarrays analysis would sort through these hypotheses, as previously conducted for other Rb-associated proteins that include Id2 [36].\n\nFor the past several years, conflicting reports have sparked an active debate as to whether the fatal anemia observed in Rb−/− mice was of extrinsic (cell-nonautonomous) [16],[17] and/or intrinsic (cell-autonomous) [18],[19] origin. During the revision of this manuscript, two studies have added to our understanding of the role of pRb during erythroid differentiation. The Walkley and Orkin laboratories have gathered convincing evidence for a cell-type–intrinsic and cell-autonomous role of pRb in erythropoiesis, using conditional Rb inactivation restricted to the erythroid lineage [21]. Another study from the Macleod laboratory has shed light on the interplay between pRb and E2F-2 during erythropoiesis by showing that the concurrent loss of E2F-2 and pRb is surprisingly capable of rescuing terminal erythroid maturation to Rb null red cells [20]. With the double mutants, erythroid precursors resume normal cycle cell arrest in S phase and concurrent terminal erythroid maturation, although the compensatory mechanisms remain unknown [20]. Our study brings a molecular basis for the existence of an intrinsic component by establishing a direct physical link between pRb/E2F-2 and the master transcription factor of erythroid differentiation GATA-1.\n\nOur findings also provide an explanation for the lack of full rescue of GATA-1–deficient mice by the related factors GATA-2 and GATA-3 when expressed in lieu of GATA-1, since GATA-2 and GATA-3, which share extensive functional similarities with GATA-1 [37], do not contain an LXCXE motif. The variable degree of severity of the observed phenotypes between various studies is likely to reflect the levels of expression obtained for the GATA-2 and GATA-3 factors according to the transgenic approach used, ranging from embryonic lethality by lack of erythropoiesis to viability with anemia at the adult stage [32],[37]. A similar observation has been reported with other GATA-1 mutants overexpressed in the same transgenic mouse model [38], indicating the importance of comparing GATA factors within the same range of transgene expression levels in these studies [39]. So is our observation with the supraphysiologic expression level of the hGATA-1Rb− Tg Line 8, and it is likely that pRb-independent pathways are also affected in the case of GATA overexpression. For instance, supraphysiologic GATA-1 expression levels may disturb the optimal GATA-1 to Gfi-1B cellular ratio, thus deregulating the antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) factor [40], or alter microRNA (miRNA) levels during erythroid maturation [41].\n\nIn humans, a severe anemia has been recently described in a family of patients with an inherited splicing mutation of the GATA-1 gene that results in exon skipping and expression of an N-terminally deleted GATA-1 protein (GATA-1s) [23]. GATA-1s is translated from a downstream ATG initiation codon that encodes Met84 in the full-length GATA-1. Here, we show that this mutation disrupts the association of GATA-1s to pRb because Met84 is located within the LNCM84E motif, thus deleting it from the GATA-1s form. However, our data also suggest that GATA-1s and hGATA-1pRb− are not functionally equivalent and, thus, that it is likely that the N-terminal moiety of GATA-1 has an additional Rb-independent role. hGATA-1s may thus result in a phenotype less severe than hGATA-1pRb− possibly because a double loss of function may elicit a syndrome of lesser severity than a single loss, as observed with the double-null mice E2F-2−/− pRb−/− [20] or Id2−/− pRb−/− [16]. A caveat to the interpretation of these experiments is that the mutation in the LXCXE motif may concurrently disrupt some other critical yet unknown function of GATA-1. These observations may also help understand the specific pre-leukemic syndrome associated with acquired somatic GATA-1 mutations, which also result in GATA-1s expression, in patients with the Down syndrome (trisomy 21) [24].\n\nThe interplay uncovered here between factors that regulate cell cycle and transcription factors key to the differentiation of the red blood cell lineage should be considered for the interpretation of pRb, GATA-1, or FOG-1 mutant mice and corresponding mutations associated with specific human syndromes. These findings may also form the basis for the discovery of similar pathways in other tissues during both ontogenesis and homeostatic cell production throughout life.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPlasmid Construction and Retroviral Transduction\n\nHuman GATA-1Rb− cDNA was generated by PCR and sequenced. This cDNA was then subcloned in the retroviral vector Migr. Human FOG-1 cDNA was subcloned in pRSVcDNA3 (Invitrogen). GATA-1V205G, GATA-1V205GRb−, and FOG-1S706R mutants were obtained using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with respective, previously described, plasmids as templates. Construct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Retroviral production and cell transduction were performed as previously described [34]. Two days after transduction, GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry (Epics Altra; Beckman Coulter).\n\nCell Culture and Transfection\n\nNIH-3T3 were maintained at low population doubling and density. NIH-3T3 and SAOS-2 cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Uptiblue reagent (Interchim) was used for cell proliferation assays with fluorimetric excitation at 560 nm and reading at 590 nm (Typhoon 9400; Amersham Bioscience). G1E cells were grown as previously described [34]. Cytospin samples were stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa to assess and score the various stages of erythroid differentiation. Hemoglobinization was evidenced by benzidine staining. Erythroid cells from mouse fetal livers were obtained from E12.5 C57BL/C embryos.\n\nProtein Analysis\n\nFor nuclear extract preparation, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 10 min at 4°C in buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40) containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na2VO4), phosphoserine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors (20 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate), and proteinase inhibitors. After centrifugation, nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 300 mM KCl. and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, nuclear extracts were quantified by BCA staining (Pierce), half-diluted with buffer A and subjected to IP using the appropriate Ab: hGATA-1 C-terminal region epitope C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mGATA-1 C-terminal region epitope, M-20 (sc-1234; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pRb (N° 554136; BD Pharmingen), E2F-2 (sc-633; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FOG-1 (sc-9361; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Nph (sc-6013R; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with nonimmune corresponding (control) Abs, respectively, normal goat IgG (sc-2028), normal mouse IgG (sc-2025), and normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Beads were then washed five times with buffer A and resuspended in 1× Laemmli buffer. Western blot analyses were performed as described [34] with primary Abs against GATA-1 (N1, Cat. N° sc-266; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FOG-1 (M-20, Cat. N° sc-9361; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pRb (Cat. N° 554136; BD Pharmingen; and human c-terminal pRb epitope C15, Cat. N° sc-50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phospho-specific pRbs (pRbPser780, pRbPser870/811, and pRbPser795 PhosphoPlus Rb antibody Kit Cat. N° 9300; Cell Signaling Technology).\n\nGeneration of Transgenic Mice\n\nWt and mutant human GATA-1 cDNAs were cloned 3′ to the mouse GATA-1 HRD [32]. DNA fragments were purified from vector sequences and transgenic mice generated by DNA microinjection into fertilized BDF1 eggs using standard procedures. The GATA-1.05 allele was monitored by PCR using primers corresponding to the neomycin-resistance gene in the original GATA-1.05 targeting vector.\n\nPCNA Staining\n\nWhole embryos were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution at 4°C for 16 h followed by embedding in paraffin. PCNA staining was performed using a kit from Zymed Laboratories.\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\nPhycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse TER119 (TER119-PE; BD Pharmingen, cat N°553673), APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 (c-Kit) (BD Pharmingen, cat N°553356), biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD71 (BD Pharmingen, cat N°557416) and streptavidin-PE-PC5 secondary antibodies (BD Pharmingen) were used for surface labeling of cells. Flow cytometry was performed using FACSCalibur, and data were analyzed with the Cell Quest Pro software.\n\nAnalysis of Cell Cycle Distribution\n\nCells were pelleted, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then resuspended at a concentration of 106 cells per milliliter in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes–Invitrogen). The cells were then analyzed with a LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with both the DIVA and the Flowjo 8.8.3 software using the Dean-Jett-Fox algorithm.\n\nSupporting Information"
