  "abstract": "Cyanophages (cyanobacterial viruses) are important agents of horizontal gene transfer among marine cyanobacteria, the numerically dominant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans. Some cyanophage genomes carry and express host-like photosynthesis genes, presumably to augment the host photosynthetic machinery during infection. To study the prevalence and evolutionary dynamics of this phenomenon, 33 cultured cyanophages of known family and host range and viral DNA from field samples were screened for the presence of two core photosystem reaction center genes, \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD. Combining this expanded dataset with published data for nine other cyanophages, we found that 88% of the phage genomes contain \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA, and 50% contain both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD. The \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene was found in all myoviruses and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses, but could not be amplified from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus siphoviruses or \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus podoviruses. Nearly all of the phages that encoded both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD had broad host ranges. We speculate that the presence or absence of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA in a phage genome may be determined by the length of the latent period of infection. Whether it also carries \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD may reflect constraints on coupling of viral- and host-encoded PsbA–PsbD in the photosynthetic reaction center across divergent hosts. Phylogenetic clustering patterns of these genes from cultured phages suggest that whole genes have been transferred from host to phage in a discrete number of events over the course of evolution (four for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA, and two for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD), followed by horizontal and vertical transfer between cyanophages. Clustering patterns of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD from \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus cells were inconsistent with other molecular phylogenetic markers, suggesting genetic exchanges involving \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus lineages. Signatures of intragenic recombination, detected within the cyanophage gene pool as well as between hosts and phages in both directions, support this hypothesis. The analysis of cyanophage \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes from field populations revealed significant sequence diversity, much of which is represented in our cultured isolates. Collectively, these findings show that photosynthesis genes are common in cyanophages and that significant genetic exchanges occur from host to phage, phage to host, and within the phage gene pool. This generates genetic diversity among the phage, which serves as a reservoir for their hosts, and in turn influences photosystem evolution.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nThe marine cyanobacteria \n\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus are the smallest and most numerous photosynthetic cells in the oceans [1,\n\t\t\t\t2]. The abundances of cyanophages (cyanobacterial viruses) that infect these marine cyanobacteria vary over spatial [3–6] and temporal scales [4,\n\t\t\t\t7]—patterns shaped by the dynamics of their host cells [4,\n\t\t\t\t8]. Cyanophages are double-stranded DNA viruses belonging to three morphologically defined families: Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae [3–5,\n\t\t\t\t9,\n\t\t\t\t10]. Among the cyanophages, podoviruses and siphoviruses tend to be very host-specific, whereas myoviruses generally have a broader host range, even across genera [5], and thus are potential vectors for horizontal gene transfer via transduction.\n\nThe movement of genes between organisms is an important mechanism in evolution. As agents of gene transfer, phages play a role in host evolution by supplying the host with new genetic material [11–15] and by displacing “host” genes with viral-encoded homologues [16–18]. Phage evolution is in turn influenced by the acquisition of DNA from their hosts [13,\n\t\t\t\t19–22] and by the swapping of genes within the phage gene pool [23,\n\t\t\t\t24]. Recent evidence suggests that gene flow within the global phage gene pool extends across ecosystems [25–27].\n\nCyanophage genomes bearing key photosynthesis genes \n\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\tpsbD provide a notable example of the co-option of “host” genes for phage purposes [13,\n\t\t\t\t22,\n\t\t\t\t28–30]. The \n\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\tpsbD genes encode the two photosystem II core reaction center proteins, D1 and D2 (denoted here as PsbA and PsbD, respectively), found in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. It has recently been shown that the phage-encoded \n\t\t\t\tpsbA gene is expressed during infection [31,\n\t\t\t\t32]. Because maximal cyanophage production is dependent on photosynthesis [31,\n\t\t\t\t33], and the host PsbA protein turns over rapidly [34] and declines during infection [31], expression of these phage-encoded genes likely enhances photosynthesis during infection, thus increasing cyanophage fitness.\n\nIf photosynthesis genes indeed provide a fitness advantage to cyanophages, one might expect them to be widespread among cyanophage genomes. Through whole or partial genome sequencing, \n\t\t\t\tpsbA has been documented in three \n\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus cyanophages (one podovirus and two myoviruses) and five \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses, whereas \n\t\t\t\tpsbD was found in only some of these phages [13,\n\t\t\t\t29,\n\t\t\t\t35]. Neither of these genes is found in the \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus P60 podovirus genome [36]. A survey of \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myovirus isolates revealed that at least 37 of them contained \n\t\t\t\tpsbA [29], and this gene has also been found in cyanophage genome fragments in seawater samples [37]. Thus, the presence of \n\t\t\t\tpsbA is a common, but not universal, feature in the cyanophages examined to date, most of which have been \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus cyanophages.\n\nUsing limited genomic sequence data from one \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and three \n\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus cyanophages, we suggested that both \n\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\tpsbD were transferred as whole genes from host to phage multiple times, but not from phage to host [13]. Subsequently, Zeidner et al. [37] analyzed \n\t\t\t\tpsbA data predominantly from field sequences and suggested that genetic exchanges of segments of the gene (intragenic recombination) may have occurred among host and phage copies in both directions [37]. However, this novel and controversial hypothesis requires further investigation with sequences of known organismal origin and using methodology capable of identifying the recombination partners and the directionality of such potential exchanges.\n\nTo better describe and understand the phenomenon of photosynthesis genes in cyanophage, we looked for the \n\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\tpsbD genes in 33 cultured cyanophage isolates that infect \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus or \n\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus (or both) and analyzed the sequences of these genes in the context of known host ranges of the phage. This dataset allowed us to address the following questions: (1) How prevalent are both \n\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\tpsbD in cyanophages that infect \n\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and/or \n\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus? and (2) To what extent have photosynthesis genes, or segments thereof, been moved between and among hosts and phages?\n\n      Results/Discussion\n      \n        Prevalence of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD Genes in Cyanophages\n\nThe \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene was amplified from 28 out of the 33 cyanophage isolates examined (Table 1). Combining these findings with published results (Table 1), we find that the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene is present in 88% of cyanophage isolates examined, including all myoviruses (\n\t\t\t\t\tn = 32) and all five \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses included in this study. However, this gene was not detected in \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus siphoviruses (\n\t\t\t\t\tn = 2) and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus podoviruses (\n\t\t\t\t\tn = 3), suggesting that there are some combinations of phage family and host genus that do not lead to incorporation of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene into the phage genome. Six additional phages yielded ambiguous results and were excluded from these analyses (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods for details).\n\nWhen present, the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene is likely to be functional, as there is evidence for the conservation of amino acid sequences through purifying selection [13,\n\t\t\t\t\t37], and the gene is expressed during infection [31,\n\t\t\t\t\t32], implying that this gene confers a fitness advantage to the phages that carry it [13,\n\t\t\t\t\t22,\n\t\t\t\t\t29,\n\t\t\t\t\t31]. Sustained photosynthesis is necessary for maximal phage production [31,\n\t\t\t\t\t33,\n\t\t\t\t\t38], and the long latent period of many freshwater and marine cyanophages (8 h or more; [9,\n\t\t\t\t\t31,\n\t\t\t\t\t33,\n\t\t\t\t\t38]) presumably results in energy- and/or carbon-limitation for phage replication. Thus, cyanophage-encoded \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA likely serves to boost the photosynthetic performance of the host during infection, thereby increasing phage production. It is perhaps not coincidental that one of the phages that lacks \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA, \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus podovirus P60 (Table 1), has a latent period of only 1 h (K. Wang and F. Chen, personal communication), which may be too short for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA expression to be beneficial. Latent period information for marine cyanophages, however, is sparse. It is not known for the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus siphoviruses that lack \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA, and it has only been shown to be &gt;8 h for a single phage strain from each of the \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses [39] and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses [31]. Further, theory [40–43] and experiments [44] suggest that latent period length may be a transient property that rapidly evolves in response to changes in host cell densities. Thus, further exploration of this hypothesis requires analysis of the latent period of many more phage isolates under variable host cell concentrations.\n\nThe \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene was amplified from 15 out of the 33 cyanophage isolates examined (Table 1). Again, combining our data with published findings, we observe that \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD is found only in isolates that contain \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and only in myoviruses, but not in all \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA-containing myoviruses. Only four of 12 \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses (as defined by original host strain of isolation; \n\t\t\t\t\tTable 1) contained \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD, whereas this was the case for 17 of 20 \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses. Although it is possible that differences in the photosystem II reaction center between \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus exist (such as differences in the rate of PsbD degradation) and could explain the biased distribution of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene among the myoviruses, there is no evidence that this is the case. The breadth of phage host ranges (as operationally defined in \n\t\t\t\t\tTable 1), however, appears to be a reasonably good predictor of whether a phage will contain \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD: 17 of 18 broad-host-range phages encode it\n\t\t\t\t\t, whereas only one out of 21 narrow-host-range phages do so (Table 1). Perhaps broad-host-range phages have co-opted both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD to better ensure the formation of a functional PsbA–PsbD protein complex in the host during infection.\n\n        Origins and Evolutionary History of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD in Cyanophages\n\nTo investigate the origins of photosynthesis genes in phages and their hosts, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (using measures to minimize systematic errors; see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods) of host and phage \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences, including new sequence data for nine \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus hosts \n\t\t\t\t\t(psbA), 19 \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts \n\t\t\t\t\t(psbD), and 33 phages (both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD). Phylogenetic reconstructions of host \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes in \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus showed that well-supported sequence clusters contain only one organism type (Figures 1 and \n\t\t\t\t\t2), with sequences from high-light adapted (HL) and low-light adapted (LL) \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus [45] forming discrete clusters. These well-supported \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus clusters are similar to those observed using other host genes such as \n\t\t\t\t\trRNA, rpoC1, and \n\t\t\t\t\tntcA [46–49], indicating that \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD have not been transferred between \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus lineages. In contrast, the \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus clusters for both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD are poorly supported, a finding different to that obtained using other highly conserved genes [46–49] and thus may have resulted from genetic exchange between \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus lineages.\n\nThe \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences from \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses, \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses, and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses generally formed discrete clusters consistent with their host ranges (Figure 1), suggesting that the transfer of photosynthesis genes from host to phage has been largely limited by host range (but see exceptions discussed below). Although many of these phages are capable of infecting both host genera (denoted as “Δ” in all figures), we designated each cyanophage isolate as a \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus or \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus cyanophage based upon its original host strain of isolation (as mentioned above and in \n\t\t\t\t\tTable 1). Given this designation scheme, it appears that transfers were predominantly from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus to their phages and from \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus to their phages. This suggests host-range-limited host-to-phage transfer events, with subsequent horizontal and vertical transfers occurring among viral lineages.\n\nTwo isoforms of the PsbA protein are often found in cyanobacteria [50]. The PsbA.1 (D1.1) isoform is constitutively expressed, whereas the PsbA.2 (D1.2) isoform is upregulated in response to high light and UV stress [51,\n\t\t\t\t\t52]. Many of the differences between the isoforms are found in ten amino acids between position 121 and 312 [50]. Based on which isoform the majority of these ten amino acids were identical to (including glutamine/glutamate at position 130), we determined that PsbA from both \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorocococus myoviruses and podoviruses are more similar to PsbA.1, the only isoform found in \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorocococus hosts so far [53] (unpublished data). Although \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus hosts encode both isoforms (unpublished data), \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses encode the stress-responsive PsbA.2 isoform exclusively (unpublished data), which may be particularly beneficial during the stress of infection. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of host-range-limited transfers of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene (but see exceptions below).\n\nHost-to-phage transfers appear to have occurred at least four times for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and twice for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD, as seen from the number of discrete clades containing phage-encoded genes in each case (Figures 1 and \n\t\t\t\t\t2). The four \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene acquisitions by phage appear to include two transfer events for the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses (\n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myovirus group 1 and 2 in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 1) and a single event for \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses all from their \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts, as well as a single event for \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses from their hosts (Figure 1). The \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene appears to have been acquired once by both \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses from their respective hosts (Figure 2). Interestingly, the three \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses that contain \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD all encode \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myovirus group 1 \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences, suggesting that this gene was acquired only once by a subset of these myoviruses. Although the specific source is difficult to determine from phylogeny alone, the placement of the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myovirus sequence clusters suggests that \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA was derived from either HL \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts or LL NATL2A-type hosts, while the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes could have been acquired from any of the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts other than MIT9313/9303. The placement of the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podovirus (\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA only) and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myovirus sequence clusters at the base of the host and virus clades provides little further information about the source of these phage genes.\n\nWe found three exceptions to the above host-constrained evolutionary scenario—i.e., cases where phage \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes did not cluster with those of their hosts (Figure 1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tFigures S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2) and did not have PsbA isoforms consistent with that of their hosts (unpublished data). These include two narrow host-range \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses (S-ShM1, S-SSM1), which encode \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences most similar to \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses (Figure 1) even to the extent that they encode the PsbA.1 isoform, as well as a \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myovirus (P-SSM1) with a \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequence that is most similar to those from \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses (Figure 1) and encodes the PsbA.2 isoform as expected for a \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myovirus. Although the latter can cross-infect across \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus ecotypes, it has not been shown to infect \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus [5]. The P-SSM1 phage also encodes \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD, which, like its \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene, is more similar to \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus psbD sequences than those of the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus host upon which it was isolated (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S2; note that this sequence does not appear in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 2 because it was a candidate for intragenic recombination; see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). It is likely that these exceptions to the rather consistent host-phage sequence clustering resulted from horizontal transfer events between a broad-host-range donor phage and a limited-host-range recipient phage during coinfection of a single host, i.e., swapping of genes within the phage gene pool [24]. Whole gene transfers within the phage gene pool are likely to be more common than this, but undetectable when occurring within phages that form a discrete phylogenetic cluster. These observations call for caution when using clustering patterns of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences from uncultured phage (obtained from environmental genome data) to identify potential hosts.\n\n        Intragenic Recombination within Core Reaction Center Proteins\n        \nThe lack of well-supported clade structure in phylogenetic reconstructions for \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus host strains when using both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD differs from those constructed using other genes [46–49], which led us to wonder about underlying mechanisms that could be responsible for such a blurred phylogenetic signal. In a recent study, Zeidner et al. [37] showed that \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus-phage-like \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences from the environment had a patchy %G+C distribution, which they suggest is due to intragenic recombination [37]. Their analyses demonstrated that such recombination had occurred within the inferred-phage clusters and within clusters spanning both phage and host \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences. They could not discern, however, whether the signal was caused only by phage-to-phage exchanges, or included phage-to-host exchanges, because the majority of their sequences were of unknown origin (i.e., they were derived from environment clone libraries), and the test employed does not assess the directionality of intragenic recombination events. Our cultured hosts and phages provide an opportunity to assess recombination partners without ambiguity regarding the source of the genes. In addition, the known host ranges of these phages [5] (Table 1), together with the types of recombination tests we have used (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods), allow us to assess the directionality and the pathways through phages and hosts that these recombination events are likely to have taken.\n\nAs a first assessment for potential intragenic recombination, we analyzed the %G+C patterns in all of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes (Figures 3 and \n\t\t\t\t\t4, respectively). \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus phage genes had similar average %G+C contents to those from their \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts (39%–46%), whereas those of \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus phages had %G+C contents that were lower than those from their \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus hosts (46%–51% versus 56%–62%), but not as low as those from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts and phages\n\t\t\t\t\t. This intermediate %G+C could be the result of intragenic recombination between variants of the two host lineages. Alternatively, it may reflect the current state of mutational amelioration of the acquired gene from a high %G+C source towards the low genome-wide %G+C of the virus (\n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses S-PM2 and Syn9 both have low genome-wide %G+C; [28]; P. Weigele, W. Pope, G. Hatfull, R. Hendrix, personal communication). If the latter is the case, we might expect such amelioration to be constant across the gene, resulting in an even %G+C distribution pattern.\n\nTo help differentiate between these hypotheses, we mapped the %G+C variation across the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes using the methodology developed by Zeidner et al. [37]. We detected patchiness of %G+C in \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myovirus \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences dispersed along the length of the gene (Figure 3), confirming the findings reported by Zeidner et al. [37]. We also detected %G+C patchiness among \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses, but not from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses, despite overall similarity of their %G+C content with their \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts. This suggests that intragenic recombination has occurred among the podoviruses\n\t\t\t\t\t. In addition, patterns of %G+C were not uniform and even markedly clumped across the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene from \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses (Figure 4), with the first segment resembling \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus hosts and the last segment resembling \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts and their phages. Thus, intragenic recombination is likely to be at least partly responsible for the intermediate %G+C content in \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myovirus \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences.\n\nStatistical methods for detecting intragenic recombination (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods) revealed strong evidence for its presence in both the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequence sets (\n\t\t\t\t\tTables S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2), but the relative frequency of recombination events was not equal for different groups of hosts and phages. Recombination appears most common among the cyanophages, and more so for \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus than \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus phages. Exchanges were detected between phages that infect both \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus as well as within myoviruses that infect a single genus \n\t\t\t\t\t(Synechococcus). Note that exchanges within a single phylogenetic phage cluster, such as within the \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses, were undetectable by our previous phylogenetic analyses. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed exchanges between \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus-specific podoviruses and broad-host-range \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus myoviruses, with the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses serving as the donors (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S1). Marine cyanobacterial podoviruses contain integrase genes and are thought to have the ability to integrate into the genomes of their hosts as prophages [30] (P. Weigele, W. Pope, G. Hatfull, R. Hendrix, personal communication). If true, genetic exchange could occur between the \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus prophage and a \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus lytic phage—a scenario well accepted in other phage-host systems for genetic exchange [14,\n\t\t\t\t\t15].\n\nIntragenic recombination involving host genes appears less common than phage-to-phage recombination events (\n\t\t\t\t\tTables S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2). Exchanges between \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and their viruses are evident, however, and appear to have occurred both from host to phage and phage to host for both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD. Although such events were not detected between \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and their phages, there were cases where \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses were the recipients of external DNA from an unknown source (i.e., recombination events possibly involving donors outside of our dataset). Thus, phages may be contributing to the intragenic recombination of portions of these genes in \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus, perhaps explaining the lack of phylogenetic structure observed in \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD trees for \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus clusters (but not for \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus clusters) relative to those obtained when using other phylogenetic markers [46–49]. Presumably, phage-host intragenic exchanges occur via homologous recombination during infection. Clearly, the transfer of DNA will be retained in host lineages only if infection fails to lyse the host (e.g., abortive infection [54]).\n\nFinally, intragenic exchanges among hosts were also occasionally detected, particularly among \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus (\n\t\t\t\t\tTables S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2). This may also play a role in the lack of clade structure among \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus strains in the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD trees. Although two possible intragenic recombination events between \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorocococus were identified, they were resolved as small regions (15–16 bases) and may be false positives. Host-to-host transfers may have occurred through the uptake of DNA directly from the environment (e.g., via transformation) or through viral intermediates [37]. Such host-to-host intragenic exchanges via viral intermediates presumably occur through generalized transduction [55].\n\nIn summary, our findings suggest that the shuffling of segments of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD within the cyanophage gene pool has generated significant photosynthesis gene diversity and serves as an extended reservoir of genetic diversity for their hosts, influencing photosystem evolution.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD Gene Diversity in Cultured Isolates Captures Most of the Field Diversity\n\nWe next sought to determine how well \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequence diversity observed in culture collections represents that observed in wild phage populations, and whether additional whole-gene host-to-phage transfer events could be identified from these wild sequences from the phage gene pool. Zeidner et al. [37] had previously examined field diversity of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene sequence from environmental samples where \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus strains were the dominant phototroph [37]. Thus, we sought to examine genetic diversity of this gene, as well as that of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD, from an environment where \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus cells commonly outnumber \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus cells by orders of magnitude [56]. To this end, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene sequences obtained from the viral-sized fraction (0.02–0.2 μm) of two seawater samples within (25 m) and below (75 m) the mixed layer in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii (Figures 5 and \n\t\t\t\t\t6, respectively). The \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences from these viral-fraction samples clustered with cultured \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus cyanophage isolates (with varying levels of support; \n\t\t\t\t\tFigures 5 and \n\t\t\t\t\t6), but not with \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus cyanophages. There was not a notable difference in the phylogenetic placement of the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA or \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD clones obtained from within or below the mixed layer. Although this suggests a lack of vertical structure in diversity among the sequence types, we did not sequence these samples to saturation; thus, such conclusions are preliminary.\n\nMore than half of the wild \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences (42 of 81) form a large cluster with cultured \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus podoviruses (Figure 5). Within this group, all but one cluster of wild sequences contain cultured podovirus sequences (Figure 5). The extensive microdiversity in this cluster (labeled “unrepresented 1”) was probably derived from within the podovirus gene pool, as evidenced by the presence of podovirus phage isolates in the more basal branches of the cluster. Other \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences from the field samples form subclusters that contain cultured \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus myoviruses and form a large group that also contains \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts (Figure 5). One cluster (“unrepresented 2” in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 5) within this group also lacks sequences from cultured hosts or phages. The basal position of this cluster suggests that these sequences may belong to phages that infect as-yet uncultured \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus hosts [57] and may represent an additional host-to-phage transfer event. Thus, our work here, together with that of Zeidner et al. [37], suggests that cyanophage culture collections represent much of the naturally occurring \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus cyanophage \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene sequence diversity [37].\n\nAll \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences from wild phages fall into a single well-supported cluster that includes a representative cultured \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus cyanophage P-SSM4 (Figure 6). This cluster reveals significant microdiversity within the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD Prochlorococcus phage gene pool in the viral-fraction from this Pacific Ocean site and suggests that phages that encode \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus-phage-like \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD genes are perhaps not rare in this environment. The four \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus cyanophages that contain the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene in our culture collection originated from either the Sargasso Sea or the Red Sea; thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the viral-fraction microdiversity from the Pacific Ocean is largely unrepresented in this collection.\n\n        Conclusions\n        \nThe phage genomic repertoire evolves through the exchange of genetic material from other phages [24] and by co-opting metabolic genes from their hosts [13,\n\t\t\t\t\t20,\n\t\t\t\t\t22]. The prevalence of photosynthesis genes in cyanophages strongly suggests that the capture of these genes provides a significant fitness advantage among certain cyanophage types. Previously, we have shown that the horizontal transfer of \n\t\t\t\t\thli genes from cyanophages to their hosts has likely played a role in driving host niche differentiation [13]. More recently, cyanophages were hypothesized to be involved in partial gene exchanges even for the core photosystem gene \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA of their hosts [37]. Here, we show that genetic exchanges involving cyanophages may have influenced the make-up of both of the core photosystem II genes \n\t\t\t\t\t(psbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD) in \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus, whereas this was less apparent for \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus. Therefore, mounting evidence indicates that host-like genes acquired by phages undergo a period of diversification in phage genomes and serve as a genetic reservoir for their hosts. Thus, a complex picture of overlapping phage and host gene pools emerges, where genetic exchange across these pools leads to evolutionary change for host and phage. Fully understanding the mechanisms of microbial and phage coevolution clearly requires an improvement in our ability to quantify horizontal gene transfer at the whole and partial gene level and in our ability to accurately estimate the relative fluxes into and out of these pools.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        DNA isolation from cultured hosts and phages and environmental samples.\n        \nEleven strains of \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus, ten strains of \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus, and 38 phages of \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus (seven podoviruses, 29 myoviruses, and two siphoviruses) were screened for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences for this study. We report here on new \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequences from nine \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus hosts and new \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD sequences from 19 \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus hosts (including two from unpublished \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus genomes for strains CC9605 and CC9902; available from \n\t\t\t\t\thttp://genome.jgi-psf.org/mic_home.html. The 38 phages screened included seven phage templates for which genome sequences are now available (P-SSM2, P-SSM4, P-SSP7, S-PM2, S-WHM1, Syn5, Syn9), enabling us to validate our PCR amplification findings. Host genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). Filtered (0.2 μm, Acrodisc supor membrane syringe filter) phage lysates in Pro99 medium were used as DNA templates for subsequent PCR amplification experiments.\n\nEnvironmental samples were collected from the Hawaii Ocean Time Series (HOT) on 15 October 2003 at 45°N 158°W from depths of 25 m and 75 m. These samples were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Osmonics, Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States, Poretics polycarbonate 25-mm filter) to remove cellular material and substantially enrich for environmental phages. A 100-ml volume of 0.2-μm filtrate was then filtered onto a 0.02-μm filter (Whatman Anotop 25) to collect phage particles and resuspended in 7 ml of a modified SM storage buffer (600 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4-7H2O, 50mM Tris [pH 7.5], 0.04% gelatin).\n\n        Overview of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD screening strategy.\n\nPCR screening for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD across a diverse set of samples presented several challenges. These included variable amplification efficiencies, uncertainty about whether amplicons derived from phage or host, and multiple gene copies in hosts. The amplification strategy was as follows: for each virus and host strain, four PCR reactions were carried out, pooled, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis; if the amplification product was not visible, it was diluted 10-fold and used as template for nested or semi-nested PCR and the resulting products analyzed; if still no product was visible, multiple phage stocks were rescreened. Multiple copies of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA in \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus strains were identified by sequencing many clones and were distinguished from sequencing errors as described below. We did not screen for multiple copies of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus or multiple copies of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD from either \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus or \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus, as when present, they are generally indistinguishable from each other [58–60].\n\n        Amplification of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD\n\nPCR reactions were performed with \n\t\t\t\t\tTaq DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates from New England Biolabs (Beverly, Massachusetts, United States) or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, United States) and carried out with a PTC-100 or PTC-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) or a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States). Template amounts were 10 ng of genomic DNA for \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus, 1 μl of lysate for cyanophages, and 2 μl of filtrate for environmental samples. PCR primers and amplification reaction conditions are shown in \n\t\t\t\t\tTables S3 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS4.\n\nThe \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene from all sources was amplified using primer pair \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA-F/R [61] and PCR protocol A (\n\t\t\t\t\tTables S3 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS4). Four reactions were conducted with each template, and the products were pooled and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primer \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA-R falls on the intron region in S-PM2 [29]. Therefore, for efficient amplification of phage \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA genes that may contain introns, and for increased sensitivity, we used the Pro-\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA-F/R primer set and protocol B in nested PCR reactions when no PCR product was visible from cyanophage lysates and environmental filtrates. To reduce the incidence of heteroduplex formation, amplification products from environmental samples were subjected to reconditioning PCR [62]: initial PCR products were diluted 1:10, then amplified using protocol A but for only three cycles.\n\nThe \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD gene from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus, Synechococcus, and cyanophages was amplified using primer pair \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-54F/\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-308R and protocol D. However, when product yield was low or absent, semi-nested PCR was carried out as follows. Amplification was first conducted using primer pair \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-26F/\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-308R and protocol C. Four reactions were conducted with each template, the products were pooled, diluted 1:10, and used as templates for a second round of amplification using primer pair \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-54F/\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-308R and protocol D. \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD from environmental samples was amplified using primer pair \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-26F/\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD-308R and protocol C and subjected to reconditioning PCR as for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA (see above).\n\nIn preparation for sequencing, PCR products were either purified directly using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) or separated on an agarose gel and then purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).\n\nTo confirm that the absence of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA or \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD PCR products from phage was not simply due to a lack of amplifiable phage DNA, we screened phage lysates for known phage genes: \n\t\t\t\t\tg20 (for myoviruses) and \n\t\t\t\t\tDNApol (for podoviruses). \n\t\t\t\t\tg20 was amplified using primer pair g20-F/R and protocol E, and \n\t\t\t\t\tDNApol using primer pair DNApol-F/R and protocol F, both with 1 μl of lysate. In all cases, a product was obtained, suggesting the phage template DNA was present and amplifiable by PCR (unpublished data).\n\nSix phage lysates yielded PCR products with sequences identical to those of a known host. These six phage lysates include five cyanophages previously described (P-RSP1, P-SSP1, P-SSP2, P-ShM1, P-ShM2; [5]), as well as one cyanophage not previously reported in the literature (P-SSP9; M.B.S. and S.W.C., unpublished data). In these cases we could not eliminate the possibility that the amplicon resulted from host DNA, the amplification of which may be more likely to occur when there is no phage template for this gene. Thus, we excluded these phages from further analyses. In contrast, phages with amplicon sequences identical to those of other phages (indicated as “ID to X” in \n\t\t\t\t\tTable 1) were passed through multiple lysates, and a “fingerprint” phage gene \n\t\t\t\t\t(g20) was used to confirm that there was a single phage in the lysate. The \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA sequence was then re-assayed, increasing our confidence in these results. Even with this precaution, we cannot rule out the possibility of PCR contamination for those few cases where identical sequences were amplified from different phage lysates.\n\n        Cloning and sequencing of PCR products.\n        \nThe \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene is often found in multiple distinct copies in marine \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus [59], whereas in \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene is either single copy per genome or encodes multiple copies that are nearly identical to each other [60,\n\t\t\t\t\t63,\n\t\t\t\t\t64]. Among cyanophages, the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene has only been found in a single copy per genome [28,\n\t\t\t\t\t30]. To allow for the identification of multiple \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene copies in \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus strains, PCR products from \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus templates were cloned prior to sequencing. Cloning was performed using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen) with the pCR4-TOPO vector. Ligation products were transformed into TOP10 competent cells. Plasmid purification and sequencing were conducted by Genaissance Pharmaceuticals (New Haven, Connecticut, United States). Inserts were sequenced from both forward and reverse directions, using the M13F and M13R primer binding sites in the pCR4-TOPO vector.\n\nApproximately ten \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA clones were sequenced for each \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus strain. The published genome of \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus WH8102 provides an example of natural \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA diversity in a given strain, as it contains four copies of \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA: two copies that are 99.8% identical and a third and fourth copy that are 99.4% and 88% identical, respectively, to the above two \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA copies [59]. Considering a \n\t\t\t\t\tTaq polymerase error rate of 3 × 10−5 per nucleotide per duplication [65], at most one error could be expected in each \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene sequenced. Thus, sequences were considered identical, and removed from the analysis pool, if they were more than 99.8% identical, to avoid data issues stemming from possible PCR error (sequencing error should be nonexistent because consensus sequences were obtained from forward and reverse sequencing of the clones). Sequence identity levels for nonidentical clones from the remaining dataset ranged from about 60% to 99.0%.\n\nPCR products from genes presumed not to have multiple distinct copies per genome (\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA from \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and cyanophage; \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD from all organisms) were generally sequenced directly (Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility [Boston, Massachusetts, United States], Davis Sequencing [Davis, California, United States], or Genaissance Pharmaceuticals). The absence of multiple significant-height peaks at single nucleotide positions in chromatograms from this direct sequencing (unpublished data) confirmed that single products were amplified during PCR. Each strain was sequenced in both forward and reverse directions, using the same primers used for PCR amplification.\n\n        Sequence analyses.\n        \nPrevious analyses have raised important concerns about using \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA gene sequence datasets that may suffer from large %G+C variability and conflicting phylogenetic signals in phylogenetic reconstructions [37]. To minimize such errors, we followed these steps.\n\nWe first performed phylogenetic analyses using sequences from all taxa (80 for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and 50 for \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD) and all codon positions (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigures S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using distance and maximum likelihood. Neighbor-joining [66] was used to reconstruct a distance tree under the HKY85 model [67]. Maximum likelihood analysis was performed under HKY85 combined with a gamma model for among sites rate variation, assuming eight rate categories with model parameters estimated from the data [68]. Maximum likelihood trees were obtained by quartet puzzling, as implemented in the program TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 [69]. Bootstrap resampling (1,000 pseudoreplicates) was used to measure the relative support for internal branches of the neighbor-joining trees. For quartet puzzling, support was estimated from 25,000 (\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD trees) or 50,000 (\n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA trees) pseudoreplicates.\n\nThese analyses resulted in trees with high bootstrap support at many critical nodes (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigures S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2). However, fitting a single tree to large datasets containing conflicting phylogenetic signals can lead to reconstruction artifacts (i.e., systematic errors) that result in high bootstrap support [70,\n\t\t\t\t\t71]. We found, using neighbor-nets [72] constructed by using the SplitsTree2 program [73], within-gene conflicting phylogenetic signals in both the \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD datasets as indicated by the box-like structures in neighbor-nets graphs (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigures S3 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS4). Specifically, networks for both genes revealed substantial conflict involving splits between \n\t\t\t\t\tSynechococcus strains, their myoviruses, and a complex of sequences comprised of \n\t\t\t\t\tProchlorococcus and their viruses.\n\nWe further investigated whether these large datasets could suffer from systematic errors related to: (i) substitution rate variation among lineages [74], (ii) heterogeneous compositional bias among lineages (e.g., %G+C; [75]), and (iii) within-gene heterogeneity in phylogenetic signals [76]. We found significant substitution rate variation among lineages (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S5) using likelihood ratio tests. In addition, nucleotide frequencies were nonstationary across these data, with significant differences in equilibrium frequencies for clades defined according to organism types (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S6; [77]). Not surprisingly, the largest divergence in %G+C across taxa was at the 3rd codon positions of both \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA and \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbD.\n\nZeidner et al. [37] hypothesized intragenic recombination in \n\t\t\t\t\tpsbA [37]. We attempted to identify this qualitatively through graphical analysis of %G+C and quantitatively using four different tests for intragenic recombination. The %G+C distribution was examined within overlapping sequence windows (a sliding window of 30 nucleotides with a five-nucleotide step) using the GCViz script [37] (available upon request from Dr. Shmoish of Technion–IIT; E-mail: \n\t\t\t\t\tmshmoish@cs.technion.ac.il) written in the R-language (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.r-project.org). Three of the four different tests for within-gene recombination are based on the distribution of substitutions (\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneConv: [78]; \n\t\t\t\t\tMaxChi: [79]; \n\t\t\t\t\tChimaera: [80]), while the fourth used a phylogenetic approach (“RDP,” as implemented in [81]). We considered only those recombination events that satisfied all of the following criteria: (i) results were significant after application of Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, (ii) regions were detected by two or more different methods, and (iii) consensus breakpoints could be estimated for a given region identified using different methods. Once a putative recombination event was detected, we inferred the best candidate donor sequence (that most similar to the recombinant segment) using RDP [81].\n\nIn summary, to minimize systematic errors in the ultimate phylogenetic analyses, we first processed the dataset as follows: (i) excluded those sequences having a strong signal for intragenic recombination, (ii) excluded 3rd codon positions, which display the largest differences in %G+C and substitution rates among lineages, and (iii) employed LogDet distances [75] to accommodate compositional heterogeneity (variable %G+C) in the remaining data. These measures proved to be important. The uncorrected dataset grouped lineages according to evolutionary rates and %G+C bias (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigures S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2), whereas the ultimate analysis did not (see \n\t\t\t\t\tFigures 1 and \n\t\t\t\t\t2). Statistical analysis of the processed dataset under nonhomogenous evolutionary models [77] revealed that the ultimate phylogenetic hypotheses (see \n\t\t\t\t\tFigures 1 and \n\t\t\t\t\t2) provided a significantly better fit to the data (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S7). Prior to processing the data, the alternative phylogenies were indistinguishable (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S7).\n\n      Supporting Information\n\n        Accession Numbers\n        \nNew sequences from cultured cyanobacteria and cyanophages are deposited in GenBank (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank) under accession numbers DQ473647–DQ473719, whereas new environmental sequences are deposited under accession numbers DQ473720–DQ473847.",
