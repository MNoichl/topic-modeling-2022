  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nApicomplexa are protozoan parasites responsible for numerous human and veterinary diseases. Human pathogens in this phylum include Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, Toxoplasma, an opportunistic pathogen that causes encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals and congenital toxoplasmosis, and Cryptosporidium one of the most important causes of severe early childhood diarrhea around the world. Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites that follow a stereotypical propagation cycle. A motile zoite stage seeks out and invades a suitable host cell and in this process establishes a novel compartment, the parasitophorous vacuole, that houses the parasite during its intracellular development [1]. Parasites replicate and ultimately produce a new generation of zoites that destroys the host cell upon egress and fan out to infect new cells. Apicomplexans have adapted to tissue and host cell niches as varied as red blood cells, intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, or neurons.\n\nThe budding mechanism used by apicomplexans appears to be the key to their ability to scale their reproductive output to the size and biology of the specific host cell [2]. In this process, many species including the malaria parasite, deviate from the conventional cell cycle and pass through DNA synthesis and nuclear mitosis numerous times amassing a large number of genomes. Coinciding with the last round of mitosis, daughter buds are assembled and each nucleus is packaged into a new zoite. It is not understood how the parasites match the number of nuclear genomes with emergent daughter buds and how buds are placed and assembled correctly. The bud is scaffolded by microtubules that emanate from a newly formed apical microtubule organizing center (MTOC) (shown in blue in Figure 1A for T. gondii) [3]. These microtubules anchor the inner membrane complex (IMC, purple), an assemblage of membranous and cytoskeletal elements that establishes cell shape and is critical to the parasite's gliding motility [4]. The MTOC is thought to be a ring structure and can be further elaborated by additional elements including the conoid [3],[5],[6]. The MTOC also organizes the specialized apical secretory machinery that delivers proteins for host cell invasion and modification. Secretion of these organelles occurs at the extreme apex and through the ring [7],[8].\n\nThe centrosome has been demonstrated to organize parasite chromosomes and some organelles. Interestingly, both in T. gondii and P. falciparum chromosomal centromeres are constantly tethered to the centrosome [9],[10]. A similar physical association with the centrosome has been described for the apicoplast and the Golgi [11]–[13]. We hypothesized that a second tether linking the centrosome to the daughter bud MTOC and the associated invasion machine could provide a robust mechanism for cell assembly. In this study we use T. gondii, which divides using the simplest internal budding process in the phylum known as endodyogeny [14] as a model. We find that in T. gondii striated fiber assemblin (SFA) proteins, whose orthologs are found in the rootlet associated with flagellar basal bodies of single celled algae, assemble into a highly dynamic fiber during cell division. The SFA fiber links the centrosome and daughter MTOC, and ablation of SFA by conditional knock out results in multinucleated cells that fail to initiate the formation of daughter cells.\n\n      Results\n      \nDuring cell division T. gondii assembles two daughter cells with a complex microtubular cytoskeleton and secretory apparatus within the mother cell (Figure 1A). This process has to be coordinated with mitosis and organelle segregation to ensure that the emerging daughter cells not only are competent to invade new host cells, but also carry the genetic and metabolic machinery required to propagate. It is not well understood how each daughter cell inherits a complete set of essential organelles. SFA is the main component of striated rootlets associated with basal bodies in green algae [15]–[17]. In previous work, Lechtreck and colleagues identified genes encoding homologs of SFA in Apicomplexa, including T. gondii [18]. This finding was surprising because, with the exception of the male gamete, Apicomplexa lack flagella. Nonetheless, antibodies raised against SFA from the green alga Spermatozopsis similis revealed a spot in proximity of the centrosome in T. gondii [18]. Transcription of the T. gondii SFA genes is cell cycle dependent with peak expression coinciding with DNA synthesis and mitosis (Figure 1B) [19],[20]. We therefore hypothesized that SFAs may function during division of apicomplexan parasites.\n\nTo define the function of SFA proteins in T. gondii, we first determined their localization. We focused on TgSFA2 and TgSFA3, two proteins that are expressed in the tachyzoite stage maintained in tissue culture. We engineered parasites in which the native TgSFA2 is tagged with a triple hemagglutinin (3×HA) at its C terminus. Southern blot analysis with a probe complementary to the 3′ end of TgSFA2 confirmed the insertion of the tag into the locus (Figure S1A). Western blot showed a single band of the mass predicted for TgSFA2-3HA (30 kDa) to be recognized by anti-HA antibodies (Figure 1D). To study TgSFA3, we expressed the gene in Escherichia coli, and raised antibodies against the recombinant protein. Independently, we also generated a strain in which TgSFA3 is endogenously tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) at its C terminus. A Western blot with anti-GFP antibodies showed a fusion protein of expected mass in the TgSFA3-YFP cell line, but not in the parental cell line (Figure 1D). This band is also recognized by the anti-SFA3 antibody, which in wild-type parasites recognizes native TgSFA3 (35 kDa) and the recombinant protein in bacterial lysates (rSFA3, Figure 1D). We next performed immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) on TgSFA2-HA parasites using HA and anti-SFA3 antibodies to detect both proteins simultaneously. TgSFA2 and TgSFA3 largely co-localize and both reveal two short fiber-like structures per parasite cell (Figure 1E).\n\nWhile observing endogenously tagged TgSFA2 or the labeling by the TgSFA3 antibody by immunofluorescence we noticed that only a fraction of the parasites showed staining. At a given time 24% of the parasites express TgSFA2, while 76% do not (Figure 1C). These percentages closely match those previously reported for interphase and dividing parasites in asynchronous populations of T. gondii [21]. Next, we co-stained cells for TgSFA2-HA and with antibodies that detect markers of T. gondii cell cycle progression including centrin and IMC1. Centrin is a marker of the centrosome (Figure 2A–2C, red), IMC1 (blue) is part of the cytoskeleton of the IMC of the pellicle and outlines the mother cell as well as the forming daughters [22],[23]. Most parasites appear to be in G1 or early S phase, as determined by the presence of a single centrosome per parasite. Consistent with our prediction, no SFA labeling is discernible in these interphase cells. After centrosome duplication, SFA labeling becomes apparent as small punctuate structures that are very close to or overlap with centrosome labeling. In parasites that show anti-IMC1 stained daughter buds, TgSFA2 labels a long structure, extending away from the centrosome (Figure 2C). Notably, the SFA fiber is arched with a spiraling hook shape at its distal end. This pattern is also apparent in immuno-gold labeled cryosections of SFA2-HA parasites. Figure 2D shows the intra-nuclear mitotic spindle of T. gondii, an early step in the budding process [2],[14]. A short series of gold particles is visible at the bottom spindle pole. In parasites progressed further in division, gold particles form an arched line that climbs into the apical end of the daughter bud (Figure 2E). We conclude that SFA2 and 3 form a structure early in mitosis, that extends into a fiber during budding, but is absent in interphase.\n\nTo test whether SFA proteins have a functional role in parasite division we generated mutants in which their expression can be manipulated (Figure 3A). We constructed a strain, iΔSFA3, in which the native promoter of SFA3 is replaced by a tetracycline-regulatable promoter [24],[25]. The targeting construct was derived from a cosmid clone carrying the SFA3 locus by recombineering [24],[26]. A corresponding strain for SFA2 (iΔSFA2) was also made. In this case we used a plasmid that was designed to introduce both a regulatable promoter and a transactivator into the locus (both strategies and the specific parental strains used are described in detail in the Materials and Methods section and Figure S2). Disruptions of the targeted loci were confirmed by PCR (Figure S2B and S2D). Mutant parasites were cultured in the presence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc) and targeted protein levels were measured by Western blots using anti-SFA3 antibodies or by reverse transcription-PCR for the SFA2 mRNA. We noted a marked decrease in the levels of the targeted SFA proteins or mRNAs after 2 d of ATc treatment (Figure 3B). In both mutant strains parasite growth was severely impaired in the presence of ATc, as documented by their inability to form plaques in a fibroblast monolayer (Figure 3C, note that plaque formation of the parental strains is not affected by ATc). We conclude that SFA2 and SFA3 are non-redundant and both are required for parasite viability.\n\nWe hypothesized that the growth arrest of mutants deficient in SFAs is caused by defects in cell division. We cultured the mutant parasites for 24 and 48 h in ATc and stained using anti-IMC1 antibody to outline cells and DAPI to visualize nuclei. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, for both mutants ATc treatment resulted in excessively large cells bearing multiple nuclei. We quantified this phenotype in the iΔSFA3 strain (Figure 4D), 59% of parasite cells are multinucleated (≥2 nuclei per cell) after 24 h of ATc treatment. Parasites with numerous apparently normal nuclei are also readily observed by electron microscopy (Figure 4C). To evaluate nuclear division and chromosome segregation more rigorously we stained mutants with a monoclonal antibody that we developed against the T. gondii centromeric histone variant 3 (CenH3). In Apicomplexans, centromeres are sequestered at the nuclear envelope in a centrosome-dependent manner and haploid and diploid nuclei have a single or duplicated CenH3 spot, respectively [9],[10]. We quantified the nuclear ploidy and note that ATc-treated mutants and controls are indistinguishable (Figure 5B). Moreover, we observed that every nucleus is associated with one or two centrosomes and that the centromere–centrosome association appears undisturbed (Figure 5A).\n\nWe next monitored daughter cell formation. Normally, IMC1 outlines the pellicle of both the mother and daughter cell (see Figure 2A and 2B). Strikingly, mutant parasites containing multiple nuclei showed aberrant or no daughter cells when stained with anti-IMC1 (Figure 4A). To test whether SFAs are required for the initiation or elaboration of daughters we stained mutants for the early marker of budding IMC subcompartment protein 1 (ISP1). ISP1 labels the apical cap of the IMC and can be detected prior to IMC1 [27]. In ATc-treated parasites ISP1 is visible in the mother cell pellicle but no daughter structures are discernible (Figure 5C). Taken together, these results suggest that loss of SFA proteins does not affect centrosome duplication and mitosis but severely impedes budding.\n\nTo better understand the mechanistic basis of the mutants' inability to bud, we monitored the localization of SFAs in relation to structures important for daughter cell assembly throughout division. Daughter cells are formed on a stereotypic scaffold of 22 sub-pellicular microtubules that arise from a circular apical organizing center, the apical polar ring [28]. In Toxoplasma this structure also includes the conoid, a motile structure thought to be involved in host cell invasion [5],[6]. We examined the localization of the SFA fiber relative to that of alpha-tubulin, Ring1 (RNG1), a component of the apical polar ring [29] and ISP1 [27]. We observed that the apical end of the SFA fiber consistently extends beyond the end of tubulin staining corresponding to the sub-pellicular microtubules (Figure 6A) and terminates at the apex of developing daughters, extending through the RNG1 staining and to the very tip of the ISP1 staining (Figure 6B and 6C). To unravel this complex architecture we imaged serial sections of dividing parasites by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 7A and 7B shows two consecutive sections through a daughter bud in which the conoid (Cn) and centrosome (Ce) are clearly identifiable. Spanning the area between them is an arching electron dense fiber (black arrowheads). The fiber terminates at a pair of microtubules that extend through the center of the conoid (arrow, [3]). Figure 7C–7E show a series of perpendicular sections through the conoid of a daughter cell. An electron dense fiber (arrowheads) curls up through the conoid coming into close contact with the apical rim of the structure and ending in the proximity of the central microtubule pair (arrow). A series of sections through a very early daughter bud shows the fiber to be already present at this stage (Figure 7F–7I). Note that it again makes contact with the apical rim of the conoid (Figure 7G, arrowhead) and that it emerges from in between the two centrioles of the centrosome (Figure 7F and 7G, arrow). Our light and electron microscopic observations suggest that the SFA fiber physically connects the centrosome to the tip of the forming daughter cell.\n\nTo visualize the dynamic development of the SFA fiber we inserted a YFP coding sequence into the genomic locus of SFA3 creating a C-terminal fusion protein. We time lapse imaged the SFA3-YFP strain and determined that SFA3 is visible for 2 h and 20 min (n&gt;5), a time frame consistent with the duration of mitosis in T. gondii under imaging conditions [21]. Moreover, we observed that the SFA structure is dynamic and its morphology changes with time (Video S1). In order to have a spatial reference for the transition events of the SFA fiber we imaged SFA3-YFP in combination with Centrin1 fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP). This allowed us to concurrently monitor the position of the SFA fiber and the centrosome [30],[31]. In time-lapse imaging the YFP signal appears right on the centrosome (Figure 8A; Video S2). The fiber then elongates away from the centrosome. When the fiber reaches about half of its final length a “hook”-like shape at the tip away from the centrosome can be resolved (Figure 8A, 100′). The fiber reaches a maximum length of about 1 µm, at which point it appears to break close to its distal end (Figure 8A, 140′–160′). This leaves a small dot (presumably associated with the tip of the daughter cell). The longer centrosome associated portion shortens from the distal end and finally, SFA3-YFP is no longer detectable leaving only the centrosome visible (Figure 8A, 200′).\n\nPolarized polymerization of subunits similar to microtubules or actin filaments could be a model for the growths of the SFA. To test this idea and to determine the direction of fiber extension we used fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. We chose SFA3-YFP parasites exhibiting two fibers of medium length (0.45 µm) and selectively bleached one of the two fibers using a diffraction limited 488 nm laser spot (Figure 8C). Figure 8B shows the target fiber prior to bleaching, note that the second fiber is not in the same focal plane as the target fiber and does not appear in this series of images. Figure 8C shows that after the laser pulse, the target fiber is no longer visible. We monitored the fluorescence of the bleached fiber after 1 h, and found reappearance of the YFP signal (Figure 8D). While the unbleached fiber had practically doubled in size to 0.85 µm, the YFP signal on the bleached fiber was only 0.35 µm (Figure 8D and 8E). For reference we also imaged the apicoplast labeled with ferredoxin/NADPH reductase-RFP (FNR-RFP). During division the apicoplast shows close apposition to the centrosome (see Figure 8F) [12]. When compared to the control fiber SFA3-YFP labeling of the bleached fiber appeared to be polar and proximal to the apicoplast. Thus, it appears that the fiber grows out by polymerization and that the new subunits are added at the end proximal to the centrosome which could be considered the “plus” end of the fiber. We note that we currently do not have a suitable probe to observe the bleached segment of the fiber, and thus cannot measure its entire length. We therefore cannot formally exclude proximal labeling due to laser induced stunting or breakage of the fiber.\n\nRootlet fibers are typically found in intimate contact with basal bodies or microtubules [15],[32]. Our observations are consistent with a polar SFA fiber that places and potentially governs the formation of the daughter cell and/or its MTOC. Alternatively, newly formed microtubules, for example, the central pair, could be recruiting the fiber to the MTOC, tethering the daughter in a secondary fashion. To distinguish between these two alternatives we tested whether daughter cell microtubules are required for SFA fiber formation or vice versa. We stained microtubules in the iΔSFA3 mutant using different tubulin antibodies. In Figure 9E, 9F. we show antibody 6–11B directed against acetylated alpha tubulin as this antibody recognized daughter cell microtubules particularly well [33]. In mutants treated with ATc for 48 h no daughter microtubules are detectable. Note that these particular cells (Figure 9F) are already multinucleated and undergoing another round of mitosis as indicated by the presence of two centrosomes per nucleus. Microtubules of the mother cell are readily detected. Conversely we treated SFA3-YFP or SFA2-HA parasites with 2.5 µM of the microtubule disrupting agent oryzalin [34]. As previously reported [35] oryzalin-treated parasites fail to produce daughter cells; note the lack of daughter IMC1 staining in Figure 9B. However, in these parasites SFA fibers are still detected (Figure 9A and 9B, green). In fact fibers are noticeably more abundant; 60% of vacuoles exhibit SFA fibers after 24 h of oryzalin treatment while only 25% of the control parasites do (Figure 9C). We further noticed that in oryzalin-treated parasites SFA fibers remain shorter and show a more uniform size distribution when compared with untreated parasites (Figure 9D). We conclude that daughter cell microtubules are not required for SFA fiber formation but that microtubule elongation may be required for the fiber to extend to its full length, break, and disappear. Alternatively, fiber elongation might require licensing by a checkpoint controlled by daughter cell growth.\n\n      Discussion\n      \nFlagella provide motility and sensory functions to a large variety of single and multicellular eukaryotes. They are anchored in the cell by the basal body [36]. Flagellar basal bodies are embedded within a complex cytoskeletal system known as the flagellar rootlet system or basal body cage, which has been studied in most detail in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [32]. There is evidence that these structures not only position the flagella but also define cellular axes of symmetry and asymmetry [37],[38]. The rootlet is composed of several types of biochemically and structurally distinct fibers some of which are made of microtubules. In Chlamydomonas, centrin-based fibers (also known as contractile fibers) interconnect basal bodies and connect the basal bodies to the nucleus [39]. Sinister fibers, first described in S. similis, connect the basal bodies to two of the four microtubules of the flagellar rootlet and to cytoplasmic microtubules [40]. Striated fibers are made up from a single SFA protein and run along microtubules, emerging close to basal bodies in post mitotic cells, and are thought to guide and stabilize their associated microtubules (Figure 10A) [17],[18]. It has been proposed that the mechanism by which SFA binds microtubules is related to the structure of a rod domain found in the protein which consists of 29 amino acid repeats. The periodicity of this repeat confers the characteristic striation pattern found in SMAFs, and also fits the spacing between tubulin subunits in microtubules [18]. Striated fibers are also found in association with basal bodies in mammalian cells (e.g., various receptor cells), but the proteins isolated from these fibers do not appear to be homologous to SFA proteins [41].\n\nIn this study we show that SFAs play a critical role in the cell division of the apicomplexan parasite T. gondii. We identified a fiber that is made up of at least two proteins, TgSFA2 and 3. This structure becomes apparent as soon as the centrosome is duplicated; it emerges from in between the two centrioles and grows away from the centrosome. Its distal end is intimately associated with the apical tip of the daughter cell (Figure 10D summarizes our current ultrastructural understanding). Interestingly, the SFA fiber is not only a tether between centrosome and the daughter; it is required for daughter assembly. In conditional mutants lacking the SFA fiber we do not detect daughter buds even using the earliest markers available. The “birth” of the daughter is the establishment of the apical MTOC. We propose that the distal end of the SFA fiber initiates and thus positions the daughter MTOC. Could the fiber itself be an MTOC? Several studies have demonstrated the ability of algal rootlet complexes to initiate microtubule assembly in vivo and in vitro [42],. It is tempting to note the peculiar shape of the end of the Toxoplasma fiber in the context of the circular MTOC found in these organisms and to speculate that the structure of the fiber may template the microtubule arrangement of the daughter pellicle. Further biochemical work is required to test this hypothesis in vitro. Chlamydomonas SFA has been demonstrated to have the intrinsic ability to self-assemble and self-organize; recombinant SFA forms striated fibers in vitro [44].\n\nWhy does a cell in a stage lacking flagella use a budding system that depends on elements of the flagellar rootlet? We believe this to be a consequence of the evolutionary history of Apicomplexa. The assembly of the flagellum and the mitotic spindle share deep evolutionary roots. The centrioles, which are at the core of many, but not all mitotic spindle poles, are homologous to the basal bodies [36]. In fact, in many cells the very same structure performs both functions. In Chlamydomonas, during interphase two closely apposed basal bodies organize the organisms' two flagella [32]. These flagella are resorbed upon entry into cell division and the basal bodies become associated with the poles of the mitotic spindle. Following division both daughters assemble a transition zone onto the centrioles and reform flagella. The rootlet (shown schematically in white in Figure 10B) appears to be important in both roles setting up division and symmetry planes and positioning the centrosome and the flagellum relative to each other as the cells move through their replicative cycle [37],[38]. Apicomplexa are believed to have an evolutionary past as photosynthetic aquatic algae. They are part of the Chromalveolata, a large branch of the eukaryotic tree of life that emerged from the endosymbiosis between a flagellated protist and a red alga [45]. The most conspicuous holdover of this past is a chloroplast-like organelle [46]. We hypothesize that the ancestors of Apicomplexa, as their present day kin likely depended on the rootlet to organize the relationship of their flagellar and mitotic MTOCs. As they adapted to intracellular parasitism they developed specialized cytoskeletal and secretory organelles that allow them to attack other cells [1]. Some precursors of these organelles are found in closely related flagellated protists that are fully or partially symbiotic, predatory or parasitic—in all these cases the organelles are found in close proximity to the flagellar basal body [47]–[49]. We propose that Apicomplexa subsequently abandoned the flagellum for most stages yet retained the organizing principle of the MTOC. Instead of ensuring that daughter cells have appropriate numbers of flagella the system now measures out and positions the apical invasion complexes (Figure 10C). Overall this suggests that elements of the invasion apparatus may be derived from flagella- or flagellum-associated structures.\n\nIn combination with the recently described tethering of the nuclear genome and other organelles [9],[10],[12], a remarkably hard-wired model for the assembly of infective parasite stages emerges. The role of the SFA fiber is crucial in this context, a self-organizing polar fiber that will initiate a daughter in the proximity of each centrosome once its components are expressed. The elegance of this mechanism is its scalability and independence of ploidy. It satisfyingly explains how T. gondii can form two daughters per round of budding, while P. falciparum forms ten to 20 in the red cell, and many thousands during liver cell infection. Direct evidence for the control of zoite formation by the flagellar rootlet is currently limited to the experiments with T. gondii presented in this study. However, we note that SFA homologs are encoded in the genomes of all apicomplexans for which sequence is available (and many other chromalveolates [50]). Furthermore electron dense structures comparable to those identified as SFA fibers in this study have been observed in previous ultrastructrual reports in Eimeria and Plasmodium [51]–[53]. Many mechanistic questions remain, some of them directed towards the relationship between the structure of the fiber and its function. There are also intriguing problems associated with the spatial and temporal control of initiation and breakdown of the structure, and how they are integrated into the parasites mechanisms of cell cycle control, which remain to be deciphered.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Construction of Tagged Reporter Parasites\n        \nT. gondii RH strain parasites were maintained by serial passage in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells and genetically manipulated as previously described [54]. To tag the genomic locus of TgSFA2 (GenBank accession XM_002367757) with a 3×HA tag, 585 bp of the open reading frame ending before the stop codon was amplified from the T. gondii genomic DNA. All primer sequences used are shown in Table S1. Similarly, 3,000 bp upstream of the stop codon of XM_002370621.1 were amplified to tag TgSFA3 with YFP. These amplicons were cloned via ligation-independent cloning (LIC) [55] into the pLIC-HA-CAT or pLIC-YFP-DHFR vector, respectively, to create in-frame fusions [56]. Transgenic clones were established by transfection of ΔKu80 parasites and chloramphenicol or pyrimethamine selection, respectively, as previously described [56]. Integration was confirmed by PCR or Southern blotting as previously described [57]. A probe complementary to the 3′ region of the SFA2 gene was amplified by PCR. Cen1-RFP [30] was introduced into SFA3-YFP parasites by transient transfection. FNR-RFP [57] was transfected into SFA3-YFP parasites and stable transgenics were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting [54].\n\n        Construction of Conditional SFA2 and SFA3 Knock Out Parasites\n        \nTo target SFA2, 1,500 bp immediately up- and downstream of the start codon were amplified and introduced into vector piKO in order to flank an HXGPRT selectable marker [58], a transactivator (TaTi) and the tetracycline regulatable T7S1 promoter (this plasmid was a kind gift of Dominique Soldati, University of Geneva). The final construct was linearized using NcoI/SpeI and transfected into ΔKu80 parasites. Clones were obtained after mycophenolic acid selection and screened for locus insertion by PCR screen (see Figure S2C and S2D). Mutants were grown in 0.5 µg/ml of ATc (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1–4 d, total RNA was isolated (RNAeasy, Qiagen), reverse transcribed (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription-PCR was performed using SFA2 specific and control primers (Table S1).\n\nFor SFA3 a cosmid (PSBLE51) was modified by recombineering [26] to replace the native promoter by a regulatable promoter. A suitable cassette was constructed by inserting a gentamycin marker [26] into the promoter replacement plasmid pDT7S4_087270 [24]. The resulting plasmid (pGDT7S4_087270) was used as template to amplify the modification cassette using 50-bp homology flanks for insertion into SFA3 (Figure S2A). The modified cosmid was isolated by double selection on gentamycin and kanamycin [26] and transfected into TATiΔKu80 parasites [24], clones were isolated after pyrimethamine selection and tested for promoter replacement by PCR (Figure S2A and S2B).\n\n        Protein Expression and Antibody Production\n        \nThe complete coding region of TgSFA3 was amplified from the T. gondii genomic DNA and inserted into plasmid pAVA-421 6xHis [59]. Recombinant fusion protein was purified on Ni2−-NTA resin (Qiagen) [60]. Rabbits were immunized with 1 mg of purified protein, and serum was collected after 10 wk (Cocalico Biologicals). The sequence encoding for amino-acids 1–110 of TgCENH3 [9] was amplified and cloned into the same expression vector and purified in a similar fashion as SFA3. Mice were immunized with 0.4 mg of purified protein, and serum was collected after 10 wk.\n\n        Fluorescence Microscopy\n        \nFor IFAs, host cells (HFF) were inoculated onto coverslips and infected with parasites. Coverslips were fixed 24 h after infection with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS/3% BSA. Coverslips were then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS as previously described [61]. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-alpha tubulin at a dilution of 1∶1,000 (12G10, a gift of Jacek Gaertig, University of Georgia), rabbit anti-Centrin1 at 1∶1,000 (gift of Iain Cheeseman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), mouse anti-GFP at 1∶1,000–1∶400 (Torry Pines Biolabs), rat anti-HA at 1∶1,000 (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-IMC1 mAb 45.15 [62] at 1∶1,000 (gift of Gary Ward, University of Vermont), rabbit anti-IMC3 [63] at 1∶500, mouse anti-ISP1 mAb 7E8 [27] at 1∶1,000 (gift of Peter Bradley, University of California, Los Angeles), rabbit anti-MORN1 [30] at 1∶250, anti-aceytlated tubulin (Sigma) at 1∶1,000, and rabbit anti-SFA3 at 1∶1000 (generated in this study). The secondary antibodies used were AlexaFluor 350, AlexaFluor 488, and AlexaFluor 546 (Invitrogen), at a dilution of 1∶2,000. Images were collected on an Applied Precision Delta Vision inverted epifluorescence microscope using a UPlans APO 100×/1.40 oil lens. Time-lapse imaging was performed on the same Delta Vision microscope in a climate controlled chamber at 37°C. Cells were grown and imaged on glass bottom Wilco culture dishes (Wilco Wells). Images were obtained every 10 min for 4 h, and processed to correct for cell drifting. Photobleaching of SFA3-YFP was performed on a Delta Vision microscope using a single 600-ms pulse with a 488-nm laser set at 20% power, on a specified, diffraction-limited, region. Images were subjected to deconvolution and contrast adjustment using Applied Precision software (Softworx). For quantitative image analysis (presence/absence of fibers and number of nuclei/cell or centromeric clusters/nucleus, as described in the Results) a minimum of 50 vacuoles were scored for each out of at least three repeats. Averages and standard deviations were calculated and plotted using Graph Pad Prism Version 5.0c. Fiber length measurements were done using Volocity (Perkin-Elmer) on images taken of SFA3-YFP parasites under oryzalin or DMSO control treatment. Each point represents the average fiber length in one imaging field. Measurements were done for at least 18 fibers (and up to 81) per image. Four images from three independent replicates were used.\n\n        Electron Microscopy\n        \nCells infected with SFA2-HA parasites were fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde/0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, blocked with 1% FBS in PBS (all RT), followed by overnight infiltration in 2.3 M sucrose/20% polyvinyl pyrrolidone at 4°C. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned with a Leica UCT cryo-ultra microtome. Sections were blocked with 1% FBS and subsequently incubated with rat anti-HA (1∶100), followed by incubation with rabbit anti-rat (1∶400), and finally 10 nM colloidal gold conjugated protein A. Washed sections were stained with 0.3% uranyl acetate/2% methyl cellulose and viewed with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope. Controls, omitting the primary antibody, were consistently negative at the concentration of colloidal gold conjugated protein A used. Infected cells were also fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer 0.1 M, pH7.4, followed by post-fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide in sodium phosphate buffer, alcohol dehydration, and Epon resin embedding. Serial sections were obtained with a Leica UCT cryo-ultramicrotome and collected in carbon-coated single hole grids.\n\n        Western Blotting\n        \nWestern blotting was performed as previously described [57]. We used anti-HA antibodies at a dilution of 1∶1,000, anti-tubulin at 1∶1,000, anti-GFP at 1∶500, and anti-SFA3 antibodies at a dilution of 1∶1,000. Pre-immune sera for anti-SFA3 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1∶1,000. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rat or anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) was used at a dilution of 1∶20,000.\n\n      Supporting Information"
