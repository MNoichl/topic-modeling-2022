  "fullText": "We, the authors, would like to correct aspects of the manuscript text and Fig 2, in order to clarify some issues that have been raised by readers.\n\n1\nAfter reanalysis, we accept that the small differences in Fig 2H between Col-0 and med19a-1 are not significant. We accept we therefore now cannot claim significance for differences between Col-0 and med19a-1 but the claimed significance for med19a-2, OE-Med19a #1 and OE-Med19a #2 remain valid. The weaker phenotype observed for med19a-1 mutant in response to Hpa (compared with med19a-2) is consistent with the RT-PCR displayed in fig 2B, where transcript for Med19a could still be observed in the med19a-1 mutant and with the discussion of the paper where we also point out that it should be borne in mind that the phenotype observed for med19a KO mutants may be only partial, because MED19a and MED19b could have redundant functions.\n\nWe therefore would like to correct the following in the manuscript:\n\nIn the Results section subheading HaRxL44 targets MED19a, a Positive Regulator of Plant Immunity to Hpa, the second sentence of the fifth paragraph should read: The med19a-2 mutant was more susceptible to Hpa than wild type, similar to a med15 mutant, which has impaired SATI (med15[37]; Fig 2H).\n\n2\nWe’d like to correct Fig 2 in order to remove the asterisk from the graph in panel H showing the sporulation of Hpa on med19a-1, and to correct the legend for Fig 2. The corrected legend and figure are provided here.\n\nThe reanalysis of the data also showed that the differences in Fig 2H between Col-0 and med21 and med25 KO mutants are not significant. We used these well described regulators of plant defence as control for the experiment. We acknowledge that the number of observations is not sufficient to claim that there is a difference between Col-0 and med21 and med25 KO. However, this result does not impact the overall message of the paper which shows that HaRxL44 interferes with Mediator function by degrading MED19, shifting the balance of defence transcription from SA-responsive defence to JA/ET-signalling, and enhancing susceptibility to biotrophs by attenuating SA-dependent gene expression.\n\nWe therefore correct our interpretation of the Hpa susceptibility of med21 and med25 KO mutants in the manuscript, as follows:\n\nIn the Results section, subheading JA/ET Signalling Is Induced in the Presence of HaRxL44, the Absence of MED19a, and 3 d After Hpa Infection, the penultimate sentence of the final paragraph should read: We did not observe in either med21 RNAi line and med25 knock out (KO) mutants that Hpa growth was reduced compared with WT (Fig 2H)”. The final sentence of the paragraph should be removed.\n\n3\nWe would also like to add the following sentence to subheading Protein Extraction, Co-Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot of the Methods section: Blots were stained with Coomassie (Instant Blue, Expedeon) to visualize protein loading in the figure.\n\n4\nWe would like to correct an error in the legend for Fig 3 to show the correct panels: A, B &amp; C. The corrected legend is provided here.\n\n5\nFinally, we would like to add the follow sentence to the Acknowledgements section: We acknowledge Dan MacLean (TSL, Norwich) for help improving the quality of the statistical analysis."
