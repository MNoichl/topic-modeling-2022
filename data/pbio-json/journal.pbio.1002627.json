  "fullText": "Notice of republication\n\nThis article was republished on March 28 2018, to correct the following figure errors that were introduced during the final publication preparation stages:\n\nFig 1B contained a satellite image that was not available for publication under the Creative Commons Attribution License (creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Fig 1B has therefore been replaced with an image created by the author. The figure legend for Fig 1 has been updated to reflect this change.\n\nFig 6C, Fig 11C, Fig 11E and Fig 11F contained an incorrect scale bar. This has been corrected.\n\nFig 20 contained a typographical error which has been corrected.\n\nPlease download this article again to view the correct versions of the figures."
