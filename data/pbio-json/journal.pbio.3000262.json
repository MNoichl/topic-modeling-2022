  "abstract": "Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expressing CD8αα on αβ T cells (TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs) have suppressive capabilities in enterocolitis, but the mechanism that maintains homeostasis and cell number is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs was severely reduced in mice lacking recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (Rbpj) or Notch1 and Notch2 in T cells. Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs expressed low levels of Atp8a2, which encodes a protein with flippase activity that regulates phospholipid asymmetry of plasma membrane such as flipping phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of plasma membrane. Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs cannot maintain phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, depletion of intestinal macrophages restored TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj-deficient mice, suggesting that exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane in Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs acts as an “eat-me” signal. Together, these results revealed that Notch–Atp8a2 is a fundamental regulator for IELs and highlighted that membrane phospholipid asymmetry controlled by Notch-mediated flippase expression is a critical determinant in setting or balancing the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nThe intestines face various foreign antigens on their mucosal interface and thus possess an integrated immunological system that can prevent the dissemination of both commensal and pathogenic microorganisms [1][2][3]. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are a population of lymphocytes that reside within the intestinal epithelium. IELs are classified into multiple subsets including TCRαβ+CD8αβ+, TCRαβ+CD8αα+, TCRαβ+CD4+, or T-cell receptor (TCR)γδ+ cells [4]. Previous studies have revealed that IELs have various roles in homeostasis of the intestine, including recovery from tissue damage and regulatory roles in suppressing colitis [5][6]. One study showed that TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IEL could prevent colitis induced by the transfer of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice [5], suggesting a regulatory role for TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in the mucosal immune system.\n\nThe developmental pathway of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IEL is still poorly understood. TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IEL precursors develop by recognizing high-affinity self-antigen agonists [7][8]. Two thymic precursors of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IEL were reported among TCRβ+CD4−CD8− thymocytes, defined by dependence on transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and other markers [9]. The further differentiation of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs is regulated by interleukin 15 (IL-15) or TGF-β [10] [11]. TGF-β signaling regulates the CD8α expression in thymic precursors of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs [11]. The production of IL-15 from intestinal epithelial cells is required for maintaining TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs [12]. However, the molecular pathways that control the development or number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs remain largely undetermined.\n\nNotch receptors interact with specific ligands that cleave the transmembrane domain of Notch [13]. The cleaved Notch translocates into the nucleus and binds to recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (Rbpj), which recruits mastermind-like 1 and p300, resulting in the up-regulation of Notch target genes [14]. Notch regulates various effector functions and development of T cells [13, 15, 16], as well as the survival of dendritic cells (DCs) and the development of macrophages [17].\n\nIn this report, we investigated whether Notch regulates the survival of intestinal immune cells. We found that the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs is severely reduced in mice in which Rbpj is deleted by a CD4-Cre transgene. Atp8a2 is regulated by Notch signaling, and its overexpression in Rbpj-deficient T cells restored the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs to levels that are comparable to those seen for wild-type mice. As Atp8a2 exhibits flippase activity that flips phosphatidylserine (PS) to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and thus helps keep the phospholipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane, Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs had more exposed PS in their outer membrane than control cells had. Thus, Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs were likely to be engulfed by intestinal macrophages. These data illustrate the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism that sets or balances the number of immune cells through flippase-mediated symmetry of membrane phospholipids.\n\nResults\n\nRbpj in T cells is required for TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs\n\nIn order to assess how Notch signaling affects the number of IELs, we analyzed IELs in the small intestine of Rbpjflox/flox mice crossed with CD4-Cre transgenic mice (Rbpj−/−) and control Rbpj+/+ mice crossed with CD4-Cre transgenic (Rbpj+/+) mice aged 8–10 wk. TCRαβ+ IELs are classified into CD4+, CD8αβ+, or CD8αα+ cells [4] (S1 Fig). The relative and total cell number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs was about four times less in Rbpj−/− than in Rbpj+/+ mice (Fig 1A). CD90 expression is lost during maturation of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs [18]. More than 80% of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice express CD90, compared to 50% in Rbpj+/+ mice. Although TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs acquire granzyme B expression during maturation, Rbpj−/− TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs have a smaller number of granzyme B–positive cells. However, the total cell number of TCRαβ+CD4+ and TCRαβ+CD8αβ+ IELs was unaffected by deleting Rbpj (Fig 1B). The reduction in the frequency of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice was analyzed by histological examination (Fig 1C). Sections of small intestine from Rbpj+/+ or Rbpj−/− mice were stained with anti-TCRβ, CD8α, CD8β, and laminin, which allowed us to detect TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs as TCRβ+CD8α+CD8β- cells. The number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs was reduced in Rbpj−/− mice (Fig 1C). The number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ T cells in the lamina propria was not decreased in Rbpj−/− mice compared with control mice (Fig 1D). Although the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs was reduced in Rbpj−/− mice, the Rbpj−/− and Rbpj+/+ mice showed comparable body weight loss after induction of colitis by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (S2 Fig).\n\nIntrinsic Rbpj in T cells is required for TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs\n\nTo delineate whether the defect of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs by Rbpj deficiency is cell-intrinsic, we made bone marrow chimeric mice by transferring an equal ratio of bone marrow from Rbpj−/− (CD45.2) and Rbpj+/+ (CD45.1) mice into irradiated (CD45.1/CD45.2) mice. The ratio of total IELs was comparable between Rbpj−/− and Rbpj+/+ mice (Fig 2A). In contrast, the relative ratio of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice was lower than that for Rbpj+/+ mice (Fig 2B). Furthermore, the number of CD90+TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs was higher in Rbpj−/− than Rbpj+/+ mice. Thus, cell-intrinsic Notch signaling is required for maintaining TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.\n\nNotch1 and Notch2 in T cells are required for TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs\n\nThere are four Notch receptors in mice [14], and Notch1 and Notch2—but not Notch3 and Notch4—are expressed on TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs (Fig 3A). We next sought to evaluate which Notch receptors control TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs by using Notch1flox/flox or Notch2flox/flox or by using Notch1flox/flox and Notch2flox/flox crossed with CD4-Cre transgenic mice (Notch1−/−, Notch2−/−, Notch1/2−/−, respectively). Both Notch1−/− and Notch2−/− mice had a reduced number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs (Fig 3B). Notch1 and Notch2 double deficiency further decreased the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs compared with Notch1 or Notch2 single deficiency (Fig 3B). We also tested the expression of CD90 and granzyme B in TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. Deficiency of either Notch1 or Notch2 disturbed the down-regulation of CD90 and acquisition of granzyme B expression in TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs (Fig 3B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Notch1 and Notch2 cooperatively regulate the number or final differentiation of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs through Rbpj.\n\nRegarding the ligands for Notch signaling that regulate the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs, Delta-like 1 (Dll1), Delta-like 4 (Dll4), Jagged1, and Jagged2 are expressed in intestinal epithelial cells [19]. Therefore, we deleted Dll1, Jagged1, or both genes in intestinal epithelial cells by crossing Dll1flox/flox or Jagged1flox/flox with Villin1-Cre transgenic mice (Dll1−/−-Villin or Jagged1−/−-Villin) (Fig 3C). However, the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs of Dll1−/−-Villin or Jagged1−/−-Villin mice was not significantly different from that of control mice (Fig 3C). The double-deficient mice (Dll1/Jagged1−/−-Villin) also showed similar numbers of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. As DCs also express Dll1, Jagged1, and Jagged2 [20], we deleted Dll1, Jagged1, and both genes in CD11c-positive cells by crossing Dll1flox/flox or Jagged1flox/flox with CD11c-Cre transgenic mice (Dll1−/−-CD11c or Jagged1−/−-CD11c) (Fig 3D). Deficiency of Dll1, Jagged1, or both genes in DCs did not affect the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. These data suggest that Dll1 and Jagged1 on intestinal epithelial cells or CD11c-positive cells are not required for Notch-mediated TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IEL differentiation.\n\nRbpj is not required for the development of the precursors of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs\n\nThe TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs are derived from CD1d-tetramer−CD25−CD4−CD8α−TCRβ+CD5+ thymocytes [9] (S3 Fig). This precursor is further divided into programmed death-1 (PD-1)+ and PD-1− cells [9]. We evaluated whether Rbpj deficiency affects the number of precursors of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. The frequency and total number of CD1d-tetramer−CD25−CD4−CD8α−TCRβ+CD5+ thymocytes were similar between Rbpj+/+ and Rbpj−/− mice (Fig 4A). The frequency of PD-1+ and PD-1− was also equivalent between Rbpj+/+ and Rbpj−/− mice.\n\nThe CD4−CD8α−TCRβ+CD5+ thymocytes reexpress CD8α following stimulation with IL-15 [21]. We tested if stimulation of Rbpj-deficient NK1.1−B220−CD4−CD8α−TCRγδ−TCRβ+CD5+ thymocytes with IL-15 increased the reexpression of CD8α in vitro. The culture of NK1.1−B220−CD4−CD8α−TCRγδ−TCRβ+CD5+ thymocytes from Rbpj+/+ and Rbpj−/− mice exhibited similarly enhanced reexpression of CD8α (Fig 4B). The expression of activation markers of IELs (CD69 [22]), a molecule required for retention of IELs within epithelium (CD103 [23]), and a molecule required for the migration of IELs to the intestine (α4β7 [24]) was similar between TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj+/+ and Rbpj−/− mice (Fig 4C). These data suggest that Rbpj is not required for the development of precursors of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs or for the further migration of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.\n\nRbpj-deficient cells express low Atp8a2\n\nWe used DNA microarray analysis to evaluate the target genes for Notch signaling that are associated with the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs by isolating these cells from Rbpj+/+ and Rbpj−/− mice. We performed gene ontology analysis (FuncAssociate 3.0) and found the expression of genes within three distinct categories was reduced (Fig 5A). Out of those genes, the expression of Atp8a2 was mostly affected by deleting Rbpj. The reduced expression of Atp8a2 as well as known Notch target genes Heyl and Dtx1 in TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj−/− mice was confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig 5B). Overexpression of the intracellular domain of Notch1 in DO.11.10 T-cell hybridoma cells markedly up-regulated the expression of Atp8a2 together with Dtx1 compared with control cells, suggesting the direct regulation of Atp8a2 by Notch signaling (Fig 5C). Atp8a2 acts as a flippase [25]. Although Atp11a and Atp11c also have flippase activity at the plasma membrane [25], the expression of Atp11a and Atp11c was not reduced in Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs compared with control cells (Fig 5D).\n\nIn order to assess whether low Atp8a2 in Rbpj−/− mice is attributable to the reduced number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs, we transduced Atp8a2 using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing retrovirus into the bone marrow cells of Rbpj−/− mice and transplanted the transduced cells in irradiated wild-type mice. Six weeks after transplantation, we analyzed TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IEL in bone marrow chimeric mice. The overexpression of Atp8a2 restored the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs by Rbpj-deficient bone marrow cells (Fig 5E), demonstrating that low expression of Atp8a2 by Rbpj deficiency is responsible for the reduced number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice.\n\nSince we saw no reduction in the number of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells in the absence of Rbpj, we next tested whether Atp8a2 mRNA expression levels were reduced in Rbpj-deficient splenic CD4 or CD8 T cells. Depleting Rbpj did not affect Atp8a2 mRNA expression in splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells or TCRγδ+CD8αα+ T cells (Fig 5F). In addition, expression levels of Atp11a and Atp11c in splenic CD4 or CD8 T cells or TCRγδ+CD8αα+ T cells were similar to those for TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs and were not affected by the absence of Rbpj (Fig 5F). The number of natural killer T (NKT) cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells also was not affected by the absence of Rbpj (S4 Fig), which suggests that Atp8a2 has a specific role in controlling the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.\n\nLow flippase activity in Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs enhances macrophage engulfment\n\nAtp8a2 functions as a flippase that translocates aminophospholipids, including PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic leaflet [25]. We examined the flippase activity of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj−/− and wild-type mice with a fluorescence-conjugated phospholipid (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl [NBD]-PS, NBD-PE, or NBD-phosphatidylcholine [PC]). The Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs showed lower incorporation of NBD-PS and NBD-PE compared with wild-type TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs (Fig 6A). In contrast, the incorporation of NBD-PC was comparable between Rbpj-deficient and wild-type cells (Fig 6A). The incorporation of NBD-PS and NBD-PE in membranes of splenic CD4+ or CD8α+ T cells isolated from Rbpj−/− and Rbpj+/+ mice was equivalent (Fig 6A). The exposure of PS by annexin V staining showed increased numbers of annexin V–positive cells among TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs isolated from Rbpj−/− mice compared to that for Rbpj+/+ mice. However, this difference was not seen for either TCRαβ+CD8αβ+ IELs or TCRαβ+CD4+ IELs from Rbpj−/− and Rbpj+/+ mice (S5 Fig).\n\nThe expression of cleaved caspase3/7 was similar between TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj−/− and Rbpj+/+ mice. Cell survival, B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Ki-67 expression was also equivalent between TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj−/− and Rbpj+/+ mice (S6 Fig). Thus, these data indicate that increased exposure of PS on TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs due to Rbpj deficiency does not affect apoptosis and cell proliferation.\n\nExposure of PS on the extracellular leaflet is detected by macrophages, which results in engulfment of cells [26]. We cocultured sorted TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj+/+ or Rbpj−/− mice with peritoneal macrophages and found increased engulfment of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj−/− mice compared to Rbpj+/+ mice (Fig 6C).\n\nWe then evaluated if the depletion of intestinal macrophages increased the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice. The treatment of mice with anti–colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) antibody (Ab) effectively depletes intestinal macrophages (CD11c+MHC class II+CD11b+F4/80+), as determined by flow cytometry (Fig 6D) and histological study (CX3C chemokine receptor 1 [CX3CR1]+) (Fig 6E). The depletion of intestinal macrophages increased the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice, although the frequency is a little bit lower than control mice (Fig 6F). As acidic phospholipids such as PS are known to regulate TCR phosphorylation via ionic interactions with the CD3 cytoplasmic domain [27][28][29], we evaluated whether Rbpj deficiency affects tonic TCR signaling. We found that the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase (p-ERK) in TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj−/− mice were equivalent to those seen for Rbpj+/+ mice (S7 Fig). These data demonstrate the contribution of intestinal macrophages to balancing the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study provides clear evidence for the involvement of Notch signaling in regulating the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. The results from rescue experiments indicated that Notch controls the expression of Atp8a2, since overexpression of Atp8a2 could restore the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj-deficient mice. The low levels of Atp8a2 reduced flippase activity in Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs, which increased the engulfment of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs by macrophages. Those data demonstrate that Notch-Atp8a2 is a fundamental suppressor that protects TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs from engulfment by intestinal macrophages. Furthermore, those data suggest that membrane phospholipid asymmetry promoted by Notch-mediated flippase expression is a crucial determinant for maintaining the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.\n\nThe lipid bilayers of cellular membranes show asymmetric lipid distributions. PS and PE are enriched in the cytoplasmic leaflet, and PC and sphingomyelin are major components in the exoplasmic leaflet. The flippases with type IV P-type ATPase activity are essential for the maintenance of phospholipid asymmetry in lipid bilayers. The loss of flippase function during apoptosis causes PS to be exposed in the exoplasmic leaflet, which provides an “eat-me” signal to the resident macrophages. Although Atp11a and Atp11c are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis, Atp8a2 is not, suggesting that Atp8a2 retains activity even in cells undergoing apoptosis. The naturally occurring Atp8a2 mutant mice [30], wabbler-lethal mice, showed progressive ataxia with pronounced neurodegeneration in the central and peripheral nervous system and die in the early life period. Thus, it would be interesting to analyze the IELs from T cell–specific Atp8a2-deficient mice.\n\nThe depletion of macrophages in Rbpj−/− mice led to the recovery of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs, suggesting enhanced engulfment of Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs by macrophages. Our in vitro coculture experiments supported increased engulfment by macrophages. Intestinal epithelial cells also have a role in clearing cells undergoing apoptosis. Bail1 is a phagocytic receptor, and Bail1-deficient mice showed pronounced colitis with many uncleared apoptotic corpses and inflammatory cytokines [31]. As the TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs are localized between intestinal epithelial cells, those cells should directly contact intestinal epithelial cells. However, our macrophage depletion experiments led to the recovery of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs to the level of control mice. Therefore, intestinal epithelial cells might not be involved in the engulfment of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice. This raises an important question about where Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs are engulfed by macrophages. Macrophages in the small intestine are localized in the lamina propria as well as crypts. Even in the lamina propria, CD169+ macrophages reside close to the muscularis mucosa of lamina propria [32]. Furthermore, CX3CR1-positive macrophages that reside in lamina propria can access the intestinal lumen through forming transepithelial dendrites [33]. Two-photon microscopic analysis revealed that CD8α+ IELs move up and down the lateral intercellular junctions of epithelial cells and migrate between epithelial cells via the subepithelial space while occasionally accessing the lamina propria [34]. As we did not detect any reduction of CD8α+ in the lamina propria in our study, we speculate that at this stage, TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs were engulfed by macrophages after migration into the interepithelial area by the transepithelial dendrites of macrophages residing in the lamina propria.\n\nWhy is membrane asymmetry of T cells linked to TCRαβ+CD8αα+ number? One possibility is that Notch signaling is crucial for the differentiation or acquisition of effector functions of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs, and cells that fail to receive the Notch signal are nonfunctional and thus removed. Indeed, Rbpj deficiency disturbs the differentiation from the CD90+ to CD90− stage, which is accompanied by fewer granzyme B+ cells than control cells. Thus, a better understanding of the role of Notch in the acquisition of effector functions by TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs is needed. TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs have suppressive effects on naïve T-cell transfer–mediated enterocolitis. In our studies, Rbpj-deficient TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs express lower levels of granzyme B, suggesting the impairment of effector functions of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in the absence of Notch signaling. However, the reduction of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in Rbpj−/− mice does not result in the spontaneous development of enterocolitis or other intestinal diseases, even in mice older than 7 mo. Notch in CD4 as well as CD8 T cells regulates crucial effector functions in multiple distinct cell types [13, 15, 16] [35–37], which might mask the development of enterocolitis in Rbpj−/− mice.\n\nIt remains unclear from our studies which Notch ligands or which cells provide the Notch signal to TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. Previous papers reported that Dll1, Dll4, Jagged1, and Jagged2 are expressed in epithelial cells in the small intestine. In this study, however, the deletion of Dll1 and Jagged1 in intestinal epithelial cells or CD11c-positive cells did not affect the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs. Those data suggest that other Notch ligands or other cells are required for stimulating Notch in TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs.\n\nA previous study reported that TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs have suppressive activity in naïve T cell–induced colitis [5]. We did not observe distinct clinical scores for DSS- or TNBS-induced colitis in control and Rbpj-deficient mice, even though the colon is the main target organ in these colitis models. We also did not observe any alterations in the degree of small intestine inflammation in Rbpj-deficient mice even when the mice were 30 wk old. Deficiency in Rbpj or Notch1 and Noth2 reduced the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs, but residual CD8αα IELs were still detectable and could maintain intestinal homeostasis at least when the animals are relatively young. In future studies, changes in the small intestine of aged mice should be analyzed.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the essential contribution of Notch in controlling the number of TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs and identified Atp8a2 as the crucial target gene for this regulation. The flippase activity of Atp8a2 was required for TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs to prevent engulfment by gut macrophages. This novel type of regulation of IEL number might be active in other types of cells and suggests that flippase activity contributes to the control the immune cell populations.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics statement\n\nAll animal studies were approved by the ethics committee for animal use and welfare in Tokushima University (H26-142).\n\nMice\n\nEight- to 10-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (CD45.2) were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan).

After incubation, medium and intestines were separately collected. Intestines were further washed twice with 25 ml of 5% FBS, 2 mM HEPES, 25 μM NaHCO3, and 40 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin containing RPMI 1640. After washing, there samples were collected and centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended with EDTA-RMPI medium, filtered through 190-μm nylon mesh, and then centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for 10 min. Percoll (GE Healthcare, England, United Kingdom) was diluted with 10x HBSS (SIGMA) to make 1x Percoll. Cells were resuspended with 16 ml of 40% Percoll containing EDTA-RMPI medium per 1 intestine and separated into four 4-ml samples in 15-ml tubes. Two milliliters of 75% Percoll containing EDTA-RMPI medium was added into the lower layer of 40% Percoll in each 15-ml tube. IELs were collected by harvesting the center layer between 40% and 70% Percoll after being centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min at 20°C with free-brake and low-accelerator condition.\n\nIn vitro differentiation of IEL precursors\n\nThymocytes from Rbpj+/+ or Rbpj−/− mice were purified by incubating in anti-CD4 and anti-CD8α Ab followed by BioMag goat anti-Rat IgG (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).

The 20-μm frozen sections were fixed with ice-cold acetone (Kishida Chemical, Osaka, Japan) for 10 min and blocked with 5 mg/ml BSA/PBS. Sections were stained with Armenian hamster anti-mouse TCRβ mAb, rat anti-mouse CD8β.2 mAb, and rabbit anti-mouse laminin polyclonal Ab (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific), biotin-conjugated goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA), and DyLight 405-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing, sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti-mouse CD8α mAb and streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 546 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For detection of intestinal macrophages in CX3CR1gfp/+ mice, sections were stained with anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated anti-Rat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, sections were enclosed with fluorescent mounting medium (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Fluorescence in stained sections was observed by confocal laser microscopy (Nikon A1R+, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nMeasurement of flippase activity\n\nTotal IELs were isolated from small intestine and washed twice with PBS. IELs (2 × 106) were suspended in buffer (2.5 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 containing HBSS from WAKO) and then incubated in buffer for 10 min at 37°C with 1.5 μM NBD-labeled PS (18:1–06:0 NBD-PS), PE (18:1–06:0 NBD-PE), or PC (18:1–06:0 NBD-PC) from Avanti Polar Lipid (Alabaster, AL, USA). After incubation, 5 mg/ml fatty acid–free BSA (SIGMA)-containing HBSS was added, and IELs were incubated for 5 min on ice. IELs were washed with fatty acid–free BSA containing HBSS. Flippase activity was assessed by measuring fluorescence in the IELs.\n\nBone marrow transplantation\n\nC57BL/6 mice (CD45.1/45.2) were irradiated at 9.5 Gy. A one-to-one ratio of total bone marrow cells (1.5 × 107 each) from Rbpj+/+ (CD45.1) or Rbpj−/− (CD45.2) mice were administered into irradiated C57BL/6 mice 1 d after irradiation. The chimeric mice were analyzed 6 wk after transplantation. In some experiments, lineage-negative bone marrow cells were isolated with Lineage cell depletion kits (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The resultant cells were infected with a retrovirus carrying Atp8a2 or a control virus three times. The bone marrow cells were administered into 9.5 Gy–irradiated C57BL/6 mice.\n\nMacrophage depletion\n\nMice were administered intraperitoneally with anti-CFS1R Ab (clone AFS98) or Rat IgG2a Isotype control (clone 2A3) from Bio X Cell (West Lebanon, NH, USA) (400 μg/mouse) every other day, and mice were analyzed 1 d after final treatment.\n\nIn vitro macrophage engulfment assay\n\nA total of 1.5 ml of 4 mg/ml thioglycolate medium was injected into CD45.1/CD45.2 mice. After 4–6 d, 6 ml of ice-cold PBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity, and then macrophages were collected in PBS. Peritoneal macrophages (1.5 × 105) were preincubated at 37°C in U-bottom 96-well plates. After 2 hr, sorted TCRαβ+ CD8αα+ IELs from Rbpj+/+ or Rbpj−/− (CD45.2) were added, mixed, and then centrifuged at 600g for 5 min. Cells were stained with CD45.1, CD45.2, CD8α, CD8β, TCRβ, TCRγδ, CD4, and 7AAD. Live TCRαβ+ CD8αα+ IELs were counted by flow cytometry.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nFor all experiments, the significant differences between groups were calculated using Student t test for unpaired data.
