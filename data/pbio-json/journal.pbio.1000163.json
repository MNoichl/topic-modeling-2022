  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nThe ability of retroviruses to utilize and manipulate cell–cell contact for the purpose of efficient transmission contributes to the spread of infection and the progression to diseases such as leukemia and AIDS. In vitro, cell-to-cell transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 100–10,000-fold more efficient under conditions of direct cell–cell contact as compared to cell-free virus [1]–[4]. The spread of the human T cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) depends on contacts between lymphocytes, and little cell-free infectivity is released into the culture supernatant [5]. The enhancement of infectivity by cell–cell contact has been suggested to reflect the proximal coupling of virus assembly and entry machineries [6]–[9]. Indeed, morphological analyses have revealed HIV and HTLV-1 antigens clustering at cell–cell contact zones between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, as well as between infected and uninfected T cells [6],[10]–[13]. These cell–cell contacts are specifically enriched in microtubules, actin, and adhesion factors, and are designated as “virological” or “infectious” synapses due to their resemblance to the immunological synapse [10]–[12]. In addition to broad synaptic contacts, thin filopodial connections called cytonemes or nanotubes are utilized by retroviruses for the purpose of cell–cell spread [14]–[17]. Importantly, live-cell imaging has confirmed the direct transfer of retroviruses from one cell to another via both, thin filopodial connections and broad virological synapses [14],[18].\n\nHere, we have applied live four-dimensional (4D) imaging in order to dissect the sequential stages of retroviral assembly, release, and transmission in real time for the model retrovirus murine leukemia virus (MLV). Our data reveal that after the establishment of contacts between infected and uninfected cells, the majority of virus particle assembly is initiated at sites of cell–cell contact. This bias in the site of virus production did not reflect any changes in particle assembly kinetics. Instead, contact-polarized assembly was dependent on signaling from the cytoplasmic tail of viral Env. In sum, we provide evidence that the initiation of retroviral assembly is directed towards infectious cell–cell interfaces, and identify the cytoplasmic tail of Env as a critical viral determinant for efficient intercellular spread.\n\nResults\n\nViral components and fully assembled virions are known to accumulate at sites of contact between infected and uninfected cells, but the underlying details of this polarization are not well understood. According to one model, virus assembly is initiated at random at the cell surface. Following completion of assembly, viral particles would subsequently be recruited towards sites of cell–cell contact [13],[19] (Figure 1, Model I). Alternatively, virus assembly may be polarized and specifically initiated at zones of cell–cell contact. Following completion of assembly, viruses would spread and infect neighboring cells [7] (Figure 1, Model II). In order to distinguish between these models, we visualized and quantified de novo assembly of MLV in the absence and presence of cell–cell contact.\n\nVisualizing De Novo Assembly and Release of MLV in Living Cells\n\nWe used spinning disc confocal microscopy to visualize individual budding and cell-to-cell transmission events of retroviruses in three-dimensional space over time (4D). Compared to conventional confocal microscopes that contain a single pinhole, the Yokogawa SCU10 scan head used in our system contains about 20,000 microlenses that rotate at 1,800 rpm and allow the capture of confocal images at high speed and with little photobleaching. This allows the fast acquisition of Z-stacks of images over a long period of time, thereby recording the spatial information (3D) over time (4D). The 4D imaging allowed us to monitor the dynamics of virus assembly and release, as well as to follow the cell-to-cell transmission of viral particles. For these studies, we monitored the assembly and spread of the model retrovirus MLV because it allowed us to perform precise single-particle tracking (Figure 1) [14]. We have also made attempts to apply single-particle tracking to the transmission of HIV-1, but these have been impeded by the greater tendency of HIV-1 particles to aggregate at sites of cell–cell contact into big button or ring-shaped clumps of Gag punctae (unpublished data) [17],[18].\n\nWe first tested the ability of 4D imaging to detect de novo MLV assembly in the absence of target cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the viral components MLV GagPol, Gag-YFP, Env, and genome [20]. A GagPol to Gag-YFP ratio of 10∶1 allowed the production of fully infectious fluorescently labeled MLV viruses [20],[21]. Six hours following transfection, we identified cells that displayed a few YFP-positive punctae and monitored them by spinning disc confocal microscopy (Figure 2A). We detected the appearance of single fluorescent punctae that gradually intensified and then abruptly disappeared or underwent diffusive movement along the plasma membrane (Figure 2A, Video S1). Fluorescent punctae were tracked from the time they appeared, and their fluorescence intensity and XYZ coordinates were measured over time. The analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity of these punctae increased from background level over time. Once maximum intensity was reached, the punctae either abruptly dropped to background level or plateau undergoing diffusive movement along the plasma membrane (Video S1). For example, fluorescent punctae B and D presented in Figure 2A disappeared shortly after reaching maximum intensity, while punctae A and C remained associated with the cell surface for approximately 30 min prior to their sudden disappearance (Figure 2B). The observed increase in intensity followed by either disappearance or diffusive movement along the cell surface is consistent with the interpretation that these events represent de novo assembly followed by release of viral particles. We defined the assembly time as the amount of time that each particle took to achieve maximum intensity from background levels. For example, for the particles presented in Figure 2A, the time of assembly varied from 8 to 30 min (Figure 2B). Interestingly, analysis of the spatial information indicated that some particles formed at the glass–plate interface, completed assembly, and then migrated to the dorsal face of the cell prior to their disappearance (shown for particle A in Figure 2C, Video S1).\n\nCombined, 25 of the 35 particles (∼70%) monitored in these experiments disappeared during the time of imaging. Of these, 60% vanished shortly after completion of assembly (Figure 2D). The other 40% remained associated with the plasma membrane for extended lengths of time, often undergoing rapid movements prior to release (Figure 2E). Similar results were obtained for COS-1 cells (Figure S1). In sum, the detection of fluorescent punctae that grow in intensity before either abruptly disappearing or undergoing diffusive movement along the plasma membrane is consistent with the interpretation that 4D imaging can detect individual retroviral budding events.\n\nContact-Dependent Transmission of MLV in Cocultures of Virus-Producing Cells and Target Cells\n\nIn order to study MLV cell-to-cell transmission in cell culture, we explored whether the virus spreads by a contact-dependent mechanism or whether cell-free virus dominates viral transmission. To distinguish between either modes, we cocultured infected and uninfected cells in a viscous 1% methyl cellulose solution previously demonstrated to slow the diffusion of large particles such as viruses [22]. We applied a quantitative assay that is based on an intron-regulated MLV luciferase reporter (inLuc), in which the expression of luciferase is prevented in producer cells and restricted to newly infected target cells (D. Mazurov, G. Heidecker, P. A. Lloyd, D. Derse, unpublished data). Interestingly, whereas 1% methyl-cellulose completely blocked infection with cell-free virus, the spread of MLV infectivity in cocultures of virus-producer cells and uninfected target cells was unaffected (Figure 3). The resistance of viral spread to 1% methyl cellulose was independent of the cell type used and was observed for transmission between the producer HEK293 and COS-1 cells and target cells such as rat XC, NIH3T3, and HEK293 cells expressing the MLV receptor mCAT1. Thus, despite the ability of MLV to be released into the medium (Figure 2), these results suggested that the predominant mode of MLV spread was through direct cell–cell transmission at physical interfaces (Figure 3).\n\nVisualizing De Novo Virus Assembly and Cell-to-Cell Transmission in Cocultures of Producer and Target Cells\n\nWe next applied these experimental conditions to monitor virus assembly in the context of cell-to-cell transmission. In addition to viral components, we cotransfected virus producer cells to express dynamin2-CFP, a marker protein that accumulates at cell–cell contacts [14]. Contact zones form specifically between Env and receptor expressing cells [14]. They are characterized by dynamin-containing endocytic areas where target cell membranes are anchored in the infected cell (Figure S2) [14]. Although dynamin2, expressed in the producer cell, has been implicated in the infectivity of HIV [23], transiently expressed wild-type or dominant-negative dynamin2-CFP did not affect the efficiency of virus cell-to-cell transmission, but facilitated the easy identification of cell–cell contacts (Figure S3). XC cells expressing a CFP-tagged version of the MLV receptor mCAT1 (mCAT1-CFP) were used as target cells [24]. XC cells were chosen because they exhibit a spread and dynamic peripheral actin cytoskeleton that assists visualization of distinct structural features at the cell–cell interface [14]. Five hours posttransfection, we initiated coculture of producer cells generating YFP-labeled MLV and target cells. Following 1 h of coculture, the accumulation of dynamin2-CFP and receptor-CFP molecules allowed us to clearly identify cell–cell contacts between producer and target cells (green). Strikingly, we observed a large number of MLV particles (red) emerging from the region of cell–cell contact (green) (Figure 4A, Video S2). Spatial analysis demonstrated that particles were formed at the edge of the producer cell contacting the target cell and then moved up towards the cell body of the target cell (shown for particle E in Figure 4B, Video S2). Correlative fluorescence and scanning microscopy confirmed that all observed fluorescent punctae correlated to single 100–150-nm viral particles (Figure 5) [25]. Single-particle tracking was used to identify de novo virus assembly events in virus-producing cells. These particles were then tracked over time, and their YFP (red) and CFP (green) fluorescence intensity as well as XYZ coordinates were measured (Figure 4C for particle E, and Figure 4D). The motility (blue) of each fluorescent spot was determined using the distance traveled between consecutive XYZ coordinates. Such an analysis revealed that assembly of viral particles (red) was specifically initiated in adhesive zones characterized by an accumulation of receptor and dynamin (green) (Figure 4C for particle E, and Figure 4D). Following completion of assembly, most particles were released from producer cells to migrate towards the target cell body (Figure 4C and 4D).\n\nRetroviral Assembly Is Directed towards Sites of Cell–Cell Contact\n\nBeing able to reliably detect de novo assembly events, we next asked whether the assembly events occurred “in” or “out” of cell–cell contact zones. Towards this end, we first identified all de novo MLV assembly events in virus-producing cells (blue crosses in Figures 6 and 7 and Video S3). Then, we defined contact zones in the virus-producing cell as the region enriched in dynamin2-CFP and receptor mCAT1-CFP. Because the contact zones are dynamic over time, the surface area of the contact zone (red line) as well as the noncontact zone (white line) were measured for the 37 time points when de novo virus assembly events were detected (Figure 6A, Table S1). This analysis revealed 44 assembly events in the contact zone and eight outside of the contact zone (Video S3). To calculate the overall assembly frequency per surface unit (in square micrometers), the number of assembly events observed in either zone was divided by their average surface area in all the 37 frames with assembly events (Figure 6B, left panel, Table S1). The ratio of the normalized assembly frequency occurring in or out of the contact zone served as an indicator for the fold enhancement of assembly at contact zone. For the cell–cell contact shown in Figure 6, this analysis revealed a striking 54.5-fold enhancement of MLV assembly in zones of cell–cell contact (Figure 6B, left panel, Table S1). A simplified approach whereby all frames of the time-lapse video were overlaid into a single image to define a larger contact zone (Figure 6B, right panel) still revealed a 14.7-fold enhancement (Figure 6B, Table S1). Although the non–time-resolved analysis clearly underestimated the stimulation of assembly at sites of cell–cell contact, it proved to be a rapid and reliable method that allowed the quantification of a large set of time-lapse videos. We applied this method to analyze additional contacts between HEK293 cell and XC cell expressing mCAT1-CFP. The observed stimulation of assembly at sites of cell–cell contact varied between 6- and 18-fold and averaged 11-fold for nine representative contacts (Figure 7A–7I, Table S2, Videos S3, S4, and S5). A similar enhancement of assembly was observed for cocultures of MLV producing COS-1 cells and XC target cells (Figure 7L–7N, Table S2, Video S8) as well as for coculture of MLV producing HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells expressing mCAT1-CFP (Figure 7K, Table S2, Video S7). This enhancement of assembly at cell–cell contact was independent of expression of mCAT1-CFP in target cells or dynamin2-CFP in producer cells (Figure 7J and 7K, Table S2, Videos S6 and S7). Thus, 4D imaging of MLV assembly in the absence and presence of cell–cell contact revealed a striking enhancement of MLV assembly at sites of cell–cell contact.\n\nMLV Assembly Kinetics Are Similar in the Absence or Presence of Cell–Cell Contact\n\nTo understand the nature of enhancement of virus assembly at sites of cell–cell contact, we first tested the possibility that assembly is accelerated by contact. Comparative analysis of MLV assembly events in the presence or absence of cell–cell contact revealed that the average MLV assembly time was similar, 14.6 and 15.6 min, respectively (Figure 8A). The p-value of 0.3012 indicated that both values did not significantly differ. The distribution of assembly time for MLV assembly events in the presence or absence of cell–cell contact was also similar, with the most frequently observed assembly time ranged between 9 and 12 min (Figure 8B). Thus, the process of virus assembly is not accelerated at sites of cell–cell contact and proceeds within 14–15 min irrespective of the location.\n\nAssembly-Deficient MLV Gag Is Recruited to Sites of Cell–Cell Contact\n\nWe next asked the question whether a local increase in Gag concentration leads to the enhancement of assembly at sites of cell–cell contact. To test this possibility, HEK293 cells were transfected with an assembly-deficient MLV provirus lacking the capsid domain (MLVΔCA-GFP). This Gag mutant exists intracellularly as a monomer and does not form virus particles. Interestingly, MLVΔCA-GFP was recruited to sites of cell–cell contact (Figure 9). These results indicate that the local concentration of monomeric Gag is increased at contact zones. These data, taken together with our earlier observation that virus assembly is specifically initiated in contact zones (Figures 4, 6, and 7), suggest that nucleation of assembly, the rate-limiting step of many polymerization reactions, is enhanced at sites of cell–cell contact.\n\nPolarized Assembly of MLV towards Sites of Cell–Cell Contact Requires an Intact Env Cytoplasmic Tail\n\nPolarization in other biological systems is governed by adhesion proteins that redirect protein sorting towards sites of cell–cell contact to establish polarity [26]. Intriguingly, during virus cell-to-cell transmission, the establishment of cell–cell contact is driven by a high-affinity interaction between viral Env glycoprotein and receptor mCAT1 [14]. Consequently, Env accumulates at sites of cell–cell contact (Figure 10). Given that the cytoplasmic tail domains of transmembrane adhesion proteins can contribute to establishing cellular polarity, we deleted the cytoplasmic tail of Env in order to determine whether it plays a role in the polarization of assembly. MLV Env glycoproteins are single-pass transmembrane proteins, and their cytoplasmic tails have been shown to regulate Env fusogenicity [27]–[29]. Because C-tail deletion can lead to a high degree of cell–cell fusion in infected cultures, we deleted the histidine residue at position 8 of Env (Env ΔH8), known to suppress Env fusogenicity without compromising receptor binding [30],[31]. The formation of cell–cell contacts and polarization of virus assembly to contact sites appeared unaltered for EnvΔH8 (Figure 11A, Table S3, Video S9). In contrast, polarized assembly was completely abolished for Env ΔH8 lacking the cytoplasmic tail (Env ΔH8ΔCT) despite efficient formation of cell–cell contacts that were indistinguishable from wild-type Env (Figure 11B, Table S3, Video S10). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that contact zone dynamics are altered, these data suggest a model whereby direct or indirect signaling via the cytoplasmic tail of Env directs Gag trafficking to sites of cell–cell contact.\n\nPolarized Assembly during Repeated Rounds of MLV Cell-to-Cell Transmission\n\nLong-term imaging experiments of several hours allowed us to monitor polarized assembly in the context of the formation and dissociation of cell–cell contacts. In this case, when imaging was initiated, we could readily observe completely assembled viral particles randomly located at the plasma membrane of the producer cells. However, in response to the establishment of cell–cell contact, we observed that assembly was coordinated with cell-to-cell transmission. We observed that cell-to-cell transmission proceeds in four phases (Videos S11 and S12). A representative cell–cell contact established between a virus-producing Cos-1 cell and the receptor expressing target cell is presented in Figure 12A (Videos S11 and S12). Both Dynamin2-CFP and mCAT1-CFP (green) accumulated together at sites of contact during Phase I (Figure 12A). In Phase II, de novo MLV assembly (Gag-YFP, red) was induced at contact zones, and numerous bright particles were generated. The assembly frequency at these sites of cell–cell contact was elevated as compared to the occasionally observed assembly of few viral particles outside of contact zones. During Phase III, viruses were released and moved along filopodial bridges towards the target cell (Figure 12A). Finally, in Phase IV, virus transmission was stopped by the apparent down-regulation of receptor/dynamin complexes at contacts, resulting in cell separation (Figure 12A).\n\nOver the period of 8.5 h, we observed four consecutive “waves” of contact, polarized assembly, virus transmission, and cell separation (Figure 12B, Videos S11 and S12). Quantitative analysis of the CFP-labeled receptor/dynamin2 (green) and Gag-YFP fluorescence (red) for each wave indicated that the establishment of contact preceded virus assembly (Figure 12B, Video S12). The average composite of these four transmission events allowed us to generalize our observations (Figure 12C). It took approximately 30 min to establish cell–cell contact before the first virus assembled. Assembly of individual viruses proceeded in approximately 10 min. In the subsequent transmission phase, which lasted approximately 30 min, additional viruses assembled at the contact site and moved towards target cells. Finally, transmission was terminated due to contact down-regulation (Figure 12C). In this system, the establishment and maintenance of cell–cell contact lasted approximately 1 h, whereas assembly was relatively swift, proceeding in approximately 10 min. Taken together, long-term imaging demonstrated that virus assembly at the plasma membrane of infected cells can be polarized in response to the establishment of cell–cell contact, reinforcing the notion of a contact-induced switch from random to polarized assembly.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt has long been known that retroviral spreading is more efficient when cells can physically interact with each other [1]–[4],[8]. Applying 4D imaging and single-particle tracking, we have demonstrated that the murine leukemia virus can redirect virus assembly to sites of cell–cell contact for transmission to neighboring cells. As such, our results support a model of polarized assembly as the primary cause for the accumulation of viral particles at zones of cell–cell contact (Model II in Figure 1). Our data contribute to the emerging picture that several steps of the viral life cycle are efficiently coordinated at sites of cell–cell contact. Future work will reveal to what extent our model applies to other viruses and experimental conditions.\n\nOur work is based on the ability of spinning disc confocal microscopy to detect de novo assembly and monitor the subsequent spatial movement of completely assembled particles. Applying a cautious definition of contact zones, our visual approach revealed an approximately 10-fold enhancement of virus assembly at sites of cell–cell contact. In the absence of cell–cell contact, particle release from producer cells into the culture supernatant was observed, consistent with the production of cell-free virus. Yet, in the context of coculture, MLV assembly was strongly directed towards sites of cell–cell contact, followed by efficient transmission to target cells. These data indicated that although assembly occurs randomly at plasma membrane, assembly becomes polarized following the establishment of cell–cell contact.\n\nIn an effort to understand the mechanism of the enhancement of assembly at sites of cell–cell contact, we observed no acceleration of assembly. On average, the assembly time observed for MLV in HEK293 cells was approximately 15 min, slower in comparison to the approximately 8 min observed for HIV in HeLa cells [32]. MLV assembly was even slower in COS-1 cells, averaging 20.2 min for 79 events, suggesting that assembly time varies depending on the cell type (Figure S1, unpublished data). Future experiments carried out in the same cell type in parallel are required to address the observed differences between HIV and MLV.\n\nAlthough virus assembly per se was not accelerated at the sites of cell–cell contact, Gag proteins that drive virus particle assembly were recruited to cell–cell contacts. An elevation of Gag levels at contact sites may increase the frequency of nucleation, thereby enhancing virus assembly. The polarization of assembly required the cytoplasmic tail of the viral Env glycoprotein. Evidence for a communication between the cytoplasmic tail of retroviral Env and Gag proteins has been reported [33]–[36]. Env expressed in polarized cells such as MDCK cells and neurons can relocalize Gag [37]–[39]. In this work, we demonstrate that the establishment of cell–cell adhesion following Env/receptor interactions can break symmetry and establish polarity in otherwise nonpolarized fibroblasts. Future work is needed to understand whether the communication between Env and Gag is direct or indirect.\n\nOur results reinforce similarities between virological and biological synapses in that the establishment of cell–cell adhesion is followed by polarization and the directed delivery of ligands towards sites of cell–cell contact [26]. Our data suggest that the MLV Env glycoprotein functions analogously to a cellular adhesion protein that establishes cell–cell contact and polarizes cells. Intriguingly, once MLV Env is packaged into virions, during or soon after virus budding, the cytoplasmic tail is cleaved off by the viral protease [40]–[42]. As such, the viral protease transforms an adhesion protein into a highly fusogenic fusion protein to mediate virus-to-cell fusion. This mechanism represents yet another clever adaptation and utilization of cellular principles by viruses to favor efficient viral spreading.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nReagents and Cell Lines\n\nPlasmid encoding MLV GagPol, MLV LTR-LacZ, MLV Gag-YFP, MLV Env-YFP, mCAT1-CFP, and dynamin2-CFP were described previously [14],[20]. Plasmids encoding mutant Friend MLV EnvΔH8 was a gift from J. Cunningham (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The cytoplasmic tail of Env ΔH8 was truncated at the viral protease cleavage site by PCR-based mutagenesis to generate MLV Env ΔH8ΔCT. This truncation has also been designated R peptide minus mutant [28],[42]. CA and Pol coding regions were deleted, and the GFP coding region was fused to C-terminal of NC Full-length Friend MLV genome to generate a mutant provirus that expresses GFP-fused deltaCA Gag as well as Env. HEK293, COS-1, and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep/Glutamine. Rat XC sarcoma cells were grown in MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS plus Pen/Strep/Glutamine. XC cells stably expressing mCAT1-CFP and HEK293 cells stably expressing mCAT1 were selected using G418 (Invitrogen) and twice FACS-sorted for mCAT1 surface expression. Monoclonal mouse anti-human dynamin antibody (BD Biosciences) was used to stain endogenous dynamin in virus-producing cells.\n\nLive-Cell Imaging\n\nFor live confocal imaging, virus-producing cells and target cells were cocultured in MatTek glass-bottom plates that were pretreated with 0.2 mg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature. To generate HEK293 cells producing fluorescently labeled MLV, cells were transfected in 24-well plates using 800 ng of total DNA (244 ng of MLV Env or MLV Env mutant, 254 ng of MLV GagPol, 26 ng of MLV Gag-YFP, 244 ng of MLV LTR-LacZ, and 32 ng of dynamin2-CFP) and 2 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per well. To generate COS-1 cells producing fluorescently labeled MLV, cells were transfected in six-well plates using 1,200 ng of total DNA (366 ng of MLV Env, 381 ng of MLV GagPol, 39 ng of MLV Gag-YFP, 366 ng of MLV LTR-LacZ, and 48 ng of dynamin 2-CFP) and 3.6 µl of FuGene 6 reagent (Roche) per well. At 4 h post HEK293 transfection and 22 h post Cos-1 transfection, virus-producing cells were replated in fibronectin-coated MatTek plates. One hour later, XC cells expressing mCAT1-CFP were added to start coculture; 1 h post initiation of coculture, live imaging was performed using the 60× objective of a Volocity spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber (LIVE CELL; Pathology Devices) and a Nikon Perfect Focus. We took advantage of the Perfect Focus to simultaneously image multiple cell–cell contacts over time. All time-lapse videos were edited using Volocity, Openlab software (Improvision/PerkinElmer) and ImageJ. Videos were saved for presentation in QuickTime format using Sorensen 3 compression for videos. Single-particle tracking of 986 particles, analyzed in this work, was performed using the Quantitation software package from Volocity (Improvision/PerkinElmer). Fluorescent punctae were identified and their YFP and CFP fluorescence intensity as well as XYZ coordinates determined over time. Additional analysis and data presentations were performed following the export of datasets into Microsoft Excel.\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy\n\nCorrelative fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy was essentially as previously described [24]. Briefly, cells were cocultured on MatTek dishes carrying an etched grid for cell re-identification (MatTek). Immediately after live imaging, cells were fixed in 4% PFA, washed three times with PBS, and then returned to the wide-field fluorescence microscope. Samples were subsequently processed for scanning electron microscopy. Cells were fixed for 30 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), rinsed three times with 100 mM cacodylate buffer, and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series. After washing three times with hexamethyldisilazane (EMS), cells were dried for 5 min at 60°C and coated with platinum. The grid was used to re-identify regions of interest and the area analyzed using a FEI ESEM scanning electron microscope (Philips).\n\nIntron-Regulated Luciferase-Based MLV Transmission Assay\n\nTo measure MLV cell-to-cell transmission, we applied a quantitative assay that is based on an intron-regulated MLV luciferase reporter (inLuc), in which the expression of luciferase is prevented in producer cells and restricted to newly infected target cells (D. Mazurov, G. Heidecker, P. A. Lloyd, D. Derse, unpublished data). To generate virus-producing cells, HEK293 producer cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the MLV inLuc reporter, MLV Gag Pol, and MLV Env. HEK293 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using 800 ng of total DNA (266 ng of MLV Env, 267 ng of MLV GagPol, and 267 ng of MLV LTR-inLuc) and 2 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per well. COS-1 cells were transfected in six-well plates using 1,200 ng of total DNA (MLV Env 400 ng, MLV GagPol 400 ng, and MLV LTR-inLuc 400 ng) and 3.6 µl of FuGene 6 reagent (Roche). At 6 h post HEK293 transfection and 24 h post COS-1 transfection, producer cells were cocultured with target cells at a 2∶1 ratio for 24 h in the absence or presence of 1% methyl cellulose. At the end of coculture, cells were lysed and the luciferase activity measured using a Berthold Technologies Centro LB960 Luminometer.\n\nSupporting Information"
