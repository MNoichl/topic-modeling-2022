  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nQuorum sensing is a mechanism of bacterial cell—cell communication that relies on the production, release, and group-wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Quorum sensing enables populations of bacteria to coordinate changes in gene expression [1,2].\n\nBacteria often use quorum sensing to orchestrate the release of public goods (e.g., enzymes or surfactants) whose functions benefit the entire community [2], and to direct other cooperative behaviors such as transitions to more efficient modes of growth [3]. The cooperative nature of quorum sensing is susceptible to exploitation by mutant genotypes that do not contribute to cooperation but benefit from it [2,4–6]. Despite their immediate advantage over the wild-type, exploiting “cheater” genotypes will be eliminated in structured populations due to their negative effect on the average fitness of the community [5,7–11]. In bacteria, population structure can naturally arise in biofilms, where bacteria can grow without significant mixing [10], or during the formation of growth bottlenecks upon invasion into a new environment [11–14].\n\nMany bacterial species employ multiple quorum-sensing systems that impinge on the activity of a shared transcriptional regulator. Each of the quorum-sensing systems encodes a specific receptor and autoinducer production gene with no or limited crosstalk [15]. In several species such as B. subtilis [16], V. harveyi [17], and its pathogenic relative, V. cholerae [18,19], the quorum-sensing systems are arranged in a parallel, seemingly redundant, architecture. That is, all the quorum-sensing autoinducer receptors funnel information into the same signal transduction pathway.\n\nIt is unclear what the adaptive benefit is of harboring multiple, rather than a single, quorum-sensing autoinducer—receptor pair when the pairs function in parallel. Here, we combine modeling and experiments in B. subtilis and V. harveyi to show that a strain that has accumulated an additional quorum-sensing system reduces its cooperative investment in the presence of its ancestor, but resumes full cooperation in a clonal population. We show that this facultative cheating strategy requires a specific system integration design criterion; the novel receptor must have a dominant repressive effect on the ancestral quorum-sensing response in the absence of the novel autoinducer. We show that, additionally, this particular network design often leads to synergistic activation of the quorum-sensing response by the different autoinducers.\n\nResults\n\nSocial Selection for an Additional Rap-Phr and against an Additional ComP-ComX Quorum-Sensing System in B. subtilis\n\nWe hypothesized that social interactions between different genotypes may contribute to the adaptive role of redundant quorum-sensing networks. This hypothesis can be approached by comparing the social behavior of a wild-type species possessing multiple quorum-sensing systems to the behavior of mutant strains harboring varying numbers of quorum-sensing systems. To explore this idea, we first examined the ComA-directed quorum-sensing network of B. subtilis [16,20–22]. This network is composed of a single ComP-ComX system and multiple paralogous Rap-Phr systems, each encoding its own specific autoinducer. The ComP receptor phosphorylates ComA when ComP is bound to the ComX autoinducer, while Rap receptors repress ComA only when their corresponding Phr ligands are not bound (Fig 1A). All the autoinducers therefore positively control ComA activity, but through different regulatory interactions.\n\nThe Com and Rap systems also differ with respect to their population genetics patterns. The ComP-ComX system exhibits significant genetic variability within the population and different alleles form distinct orthogonal signaling pherotypes [20]. These different pherotypes often display partial cross-inhibition, such that an autoinducer from one strain inhibits the response of another strain to its cognate autoinducer [23]. Nonetheless, only a single ComP-ComX system is encoded in each B. subtilis isolate. By contrast, all B. subtilis strains encode multiple Rap-Phr systems. The exact number varies between strains, likely due to the association of some Rap-Phr systems with mobile elements [24].\n\nIt was previously shown that deletion of any Rap-Phr system has only a small effect on ComA activity, while deletion of the phr genes or overexpression of the rap genes led to repression of quorum sensing [16,25]. It is therefore unclear why so many quorum-sensing systems regulate ComA, and specifically, why Rap-Phr paralogs proliferate in the genome, while ComP-ComX is unique. To address this question, we constructed strains in which we added to the wild-type strain a novel ComP-ComX system (ExtraCom strain, comQXPRO-H-1+ [20]) or we either added (ExtraRap strain, rapPphrP+ [26]) or we deleted (MinusRap strain, ΔrapFphrF) a Rap-Phr system (Fig 1B, see methods and S1 File for strain construction details). The autoinducing signals produced by the introduced ExtraRap and ExtraCom systems differed from those made by the paralogs present in the parent strain with no cross-activation [20,26] (S1 Fig). We note, however, that the comXRO-H-1 autoinducer cross-inhibits the endogenous ComP168 receptor [23].\n\nWe examined the behavior of these strains under surface-swarming motility conditions, which strictly require the production and release of a ComA-dependent surfactant called surfactin [27,28] (Fig 1C, see methods for details on swarm motility protocol). Unlike the ΔcomA mutant, the above quorum-sensing variant strains exhibited robust swarming, reaching a similar cell yield as the wild-type after 48 h (Fig 1C, S1A Fig, p = 1×10−5, F(4,12) = 8.1, n = 16; two-way ANOVA for difference between genotypes when including ΔcomA, p = 0.26, F(3,9) = 8.1, n = 12 without ΔcomA). Altering the number of quorum-sensing systems therefore does not significantly affect the fitness of the bacteria in clonal populations.\n\nSurfactin may function as a costly public good during swarming, allowing “cheater” strains to exploit the wild-type in coculture. In agreement with this possibility, we found that the ΔcomA mutant strain regained its ability to swarm when cocultured with the wild-type, and in so doing, dramatically increased its relative frequency in the population (Fig 1D and S1B Fig; p = 10−4, two sample t test, n = 42, see methods for details of the competition experiments and the wild-type competition against itself in Fig 1C that was carried out as a control). When we performed similar coculture experiments between the wild-type and the different quorum-sensing variants, we found that the strain carrying an additional Rap-Phr system was strongly selected for over a strain lacking it. In contrast, the ExtraCom strain was out-competed by the wild-type. Moreover, the fitness advantage of the ExtraRap strain over the wild-type was similar to that of the “cheater” ΔcomA mutant at low frequency (p = 0.21, t(4,32) = 0.8, linear regression comparison of the intercepts at zero frequency) and approached neutrality as its frequency increased (Fig 1D, p = 0.13, t(2,16) = 1.06, linear regression comparison of the intercepts at zero at a frequency of one). Similar results were obtained for wild-type exploitation of the MinusRap strain (S1C Fig).\n\nIn contrast to the selection of the ExtraRap strain, the ExtraCom strain remained close to neutral with respect to the wild-type at low frequency, but its competitive disadvantage increased with increasing frequency (Fig 1D, p = 10−8, t(2,16) = 11, linear regression of slope). Our results are therefore in agreement with the observed population genetics data for the two systems—selection for genomic proliferation of Rap-Phr systems and against proliferation of the ComP-ComX system.\n\nMathematical Model Predicts That Facultative Cheating Underlies Social Selection\n\nTo gain further insight into our results, we mathematically modeled cellular growth and quorum-sensing signaling dynamics during swarming (Fig 2). In the model, we assume a simplified ancestral strain encoding a single ComP-ComX and a single Rap-Phr system. We explored the growth and social dynamics of this ancestor and its corresponding ExtraRap- and ExtraCom-derived strains during swarming (see methods and S1 File for description of the model and its assumptions). Strikingly, the model was able to capture qualitatively the experimental results we obtained above both in clonal and social conditions (Fig 2A and S2 Fig, compare with Fig 1B and 1C). The findings underpin how selection depends on the particular circuit design of the two quorum-sensing systems.\n\nThe model also provides simple explanations for the frequency dependence of the ExtraRap system and the difference in selection for and against the ExtraRap and ExtraCom strains, respectively. When a derived “Extra” strain is at low frequency, the concentration of the novel autoinducer it produces is very low compared to those of the ancestral autoinducers, which are produced by all the members in the population (Fig 2A, left insets). In this scenario, the level of quorum-sensing response of the “Extra” strain depends on the activity of the unliganded form of the novel receptor. In the ExtraCom system, the novel ComP receptor is inactive in the absence of its cognate autoinducer. The ancestral network will therefore not be affected by the presence of the novel ComP system, which leads to equal quorum-sensing activation of the ancestral and ExtraCom strains (Fig 2A and 2C). In contrast, in the ExtraRap strain, the autoinducer-free novel Rap receptor represses ComA. Repression is dominant and overpowers activation of ComA by the shared ancestral quorum-sensing system (Fig 2A). Activated ComA levels will therefore be lower in the ExtraRap strain than in the ancestral strain (Fig 2B), leading to selection of the ExtraRap strain due to exploitation of the ancestral strain.\n\nAs the frequency of the derived “Extra” strain increases, so does the concentration of its corresponding novel autoinducer (Fig 2A, right insets). In the case of the ExtraRap strain, accumulation of the novel autoinducer leads to partial de-repression of ComA to a level that approaches that of the ancestor (Fig 2B), and this condition occurs as the ExtraRap strain approaches fixation. Therefore, the ExtraRap strain acts as a cheater at low frequency but returns to full cooperation when fixed in the population. In the case of the ExtraCom strain, accumulation of the novel autoinducer leads to a corresponding increase in its quorum-sensing response. In the specific experimental case we examined, the novel ComX system (ComXRO-H-1) in the ExtraCom strain cross-inhibits the ancestral ComP168 receptor, leading to a strong reduction in ComA activity in the wild-type, ancestral strain (Fig 2C). The ancestral strain therefore acts as a cheater with respect to the ExtraCom strain. Our modeling framework also allows us to explore a theoretical case in which no cross-inhibition occurs. In this situation, the ancestral strain maintains a constant level of ComA activity (S3 Fig). The net selective effect, with or without autoinducer cross-inhibition, is against the ExtraCom system, although selection is stronger when autoinducer cross-inhibition occurs (S3 Fig) [9]. Thus, while autoinducer cross-inhibition naturally exists in the B. subtilis system we are studying, this feature is not strictly required for selection against accumulation of a novel quorum-sensing system (S3 Fig).\n\nOur model also predicts how the novel autoinducer will act with respect to the ancestral autoinducer in that the model provides us with information about what type of regulatory input—output gate is established. An additional ComP-ComX system leads to formation of an OR-like (additive) regulatory gate for the two ComX autoinducers with respect to their control of ComA activity (Fig 2E). Thus, a single autoinducer is sufficient to elicit a strong quorum-sensing response. In contrast, the repressive activity of an additional Rap system leads to formation of an AND-like (multiplicative) gate between it and the ancestral Phr or ComX system. Thus, the simultaneous presence of both autoinducers is required to elicit a strong response (Fig 2D and S4A Fig).\n\nExperimental Verification of Facultative Cheating and Autoinducer Input-Output Gate Structures in B. subtilis\n\nOur model predicts that the different architectures of the two quorum-sensing systems lead to differential investment in cooperative behavior by the ancestral and derived strains as well as to distinct regulatory input—output gate structures. These features result in the observed patterns of selection. To address these predictions experimentally, we introduced a YFP transcriptional reporter for ComA activity (PsrfA-YFP) into the wild-type, the ExtraCom, and the MinusRap strains. We cocultured each reporter-containing strain with a reporter-free counterpart and measured gene expression as a function of frequency (Fig 3A and 3B and S5A Fig). To minimize the effect of changes in frequency and spatial distribution, we performed these assays in minimal medium using a surfactin production-deficient mutant of the sfp gene (sfp− [27]), which has reduced quorum-sensing-associated cost. Similar results were obtained when gene expression was measured during swarming (S5B Fig). The absence of surfactin in the minimal growth medium did not significantly affect expression of the PsrfA-YFP reporter construct in the cocultured strains (S5B Fig). We found that, when the MinusRap and wild-type strains are cocultured, the MinusRap strain maintained a constant ComA activity, irrespective of its frequency in the population (F(1,16) = 0.41, p = 0.53, n = 18, linear regression of the slope). In contrast, at low frequency, the wild-type exhibited low level ComA activity, which increased with increasing frequency of the wild-type (F(1,15) = 96, n = 17, p &lt; 10−7, linear regression of the slope). At high frequencies, wild-type ComA activity approached the activity level of the MinusRap strain (Fig 3A, t test, p = 0.43 for interception of best-fitted lines at a frequency of 1).\n\nWhen the ExtraCom strain was cocultured with the wild-type, ComA activity was the same in both strains when the frequency of the ExtraCom strain was low (t test for linear regression of lines, p = 0.26 for interception at frequency of zero). ComA activity in the ExtraCom strain increased with increasing frequency (Fig 3B, p = 10−11 F(1,14) = 405, for a zero slope). In accordance with the expected effects of crossinhibition (Fig 2 and S3 Fig), the ComA activity of the wild-type strain decreased dramatically with increasing frequency of the ExtraCom strain (Fig 3B, p = 10−6 F(1,15) = 54, for a zero slope).\n\nWe next measured the resulting regulatory gate structure of the response of ComA to addition of multiple autoinducers. We constructed a strain constitutively expressing the rapF and rapC receptor genes but not their respective phrF and phrC autoinducer-production genes. We found that the ComA response was significant only if both the PhrF and PhrC autoinducers were present, showing an AND-like gate structure (Fig 3C, S6A and S6B Fig). Likewise, an AND-like response occurred for PhrF and ComX regulation of ComA (S5 Fig). In contrast, regulation of ComA by the two ComX autoinducers in the ExtraCom strain was additive as expected for an OR-like response (Fig 3D, S6C, S6D and S6E Fig, methods).\n\nA General Design Criterion for Accumulation of Quorum-Sensing Systems\n\nThe experimental results support the role of social interactions in selection for accumulation of Rap-Phr systems coupled with selection against accumulation of ComP-ComX systems in B. subtilis. In order to generalize these results, we formulated a generic model of selection with respect to quorum-sensing-dependent public goods (S1 File). This model suggests that two design criteria are necessary and sufficient for the invasion of a strain carrying an additional quorum-sensing system into a population lacking it: 1) Dominant repression: The ligand-free novel receptor should act negatively to overpower the quorum-sensing response of the ancestral system, and 2) Facultative operation: The addition of the novel autoinducer should restore the quorum-sensing response to levels similar to that of the ancestor. The combination of these two features allows the invading strain to perform facultative cheating—cheat the ancestor in coculture (criterion #1) but resume cooperation when it is fixed in the population (criterion #2) [9,29].\n\nIn the S1 File, we show that if repression by the novel quorum-sensing system is strong, the two autoinducers will regulate the response in an AND-like manner. We further demonstrate that formation of an AND-like gate is sufficient but not mandatory to select for acquisition of a novel quorum-sensing system. Likewise, an OR-like gate between autoinducers is sufficient but not required to select against the acquisition of a novel quorum-sensing system. The AND-like and OR-like gate structures provide an intuitive, albeit simplified, explanation for selection (AND) or counterselection (OR) of an evolved strain. If both autoinducers are necessary to activate the quorum-sensing response in the evolved strain (AND gate), while the ancestral strain produces and responds to only one of the autoinducers, then the evolved strain will cease to cooperate when present as a small minority together with its ancestor. In contrast, if either autoinducer is sufficient, then the evolved strain will continue to cooperate even when it is present as a minority.\n\nAccumulation of Quorum-Sensing Systems Leads to Facultative Cooperative Investment in V. harveyi\n\nWe next examined whether our results also apply to another well-studied model organism in which multiple quorum-sensing systems exist and control a common output. The bioluminescent marine bacterium V. harveyi [15] has a quorum-sensing network composed of three parallel systems that regulate expression of the quorum-sensing master transcription factor LuxR, which controls multiple traits including bioluminescence emission (Fig 4A). A similar architecture composed of four quorum-sensing systems exists in the related pathogen, V. cholerae [19]. While the deletion of any of the receptors does not affect the quorum-sensing response [18], deletion of any of the autoinducer synthase genes represses LuxR-activated genes, demonstrating the dominant repressive effect of each ligand-free receptor [17]. In addition, two of the autoinducers have been shown to act multiplicatively in their regulation of LuxR [30] and to synergistically control bioluminescence [31]. We used the abundant quantitative data on this organism to construct a model of the expected social behavior of the wild-type and an ancestral-like strain deleted for any one of the quorum-sensing systems (S1 File, S7A Fig). The model predicts that the wild-type will reduce its cooperative investment in the presence of such an ancestral strain, which will lead to facultative cheating under appropriate conditions.\n\nTo verify the model experimentally, we constructed a putative ancestral strain deleted for the luxMN autoinducer-receptor system. We introduced a null mutation into the lux (luciferase) operon in the wild type and derived ancestral strains, and by mixing Lux+ and Lux− pairs (WT/Lux+ mixed with luxMN/Lux− and WT/Lux− mixed with luxMN/Lux+), we could measure the level of quorum-sensing response per cell of the Lux+ strain in each coculture (Fig 4B and S7B Fig, methods). As expected from the model, we found that light production by the luxMN mutant strain remained almost constant irrespective of its frequency (the small decrease is most likely due to the effect of the lux locus, S7B Fig). The wild-type showed a near 100-fold reduction in bioluminescence output compared to the luxMN mutant at low frequency (p &lt; 10−13, T(32) = 12.7, t test on linear regression for intersect at zero frequency), while approaching the same level of light production as the luxMN mutant at high frequency. Our rationale therefore also applies to the parallel quorum-sensing network of V. harveyi.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this work, we propose that bacteria possessing multiple quorum-sensing networks that control the identical response, which are commonly found in nature, are selected through a facultative cheating process. Facultative cheating has been described in the past as a strategy by which microorganisms exploit nonkin but return to cooperation in the presence of kin [32]. Such behavior has been described in fruiting body-forming amoeba and bacteria [29,33], but the underlying molecular processes that lead to it are unknown [34]; however, links to cell—cell signaling and facultative cheating have been suggested [35–37].\n\nWe predict that accumulation of multiple quorum-sensing systems requires a specific set of network design criteria, the functioning of which we explored in two diverse but well studied organisms. Specifically, the introduced novel receptor must repress the quorum-sensing response in the absence of the novel autoinducer, as occurs in the B. subtilis Rap-Phr and V. harveyi Lux quorum-sensing systems. In contrast to these systems that depend on repression, other quorum-sensing systems exist that act positively, in that the receptor functions as an activator upon autoinducer binding. Our model and experimental results explain why accumulation of parallel positively acting systems is selected against. Indeed, we do not know of any bacterium that possesses multiple activation-based quorum-sensing systems that function in parallel. Rather, activation-based systems are commonly organized in a hierarchy, in which one quorum-sensing system regulates the expression of a second system. A hierarchical network design is not fully redundant because the two quorum-sensing systems can control different genes. Further work will be required to define the benefits and possible evolutionary routes giving rise to quorum-sensing systems that function positively and are arranged as hierarchies.\n\nBeyond facultative cheating, other possible adaptive functions for possessing multiple quorum-sensing systems have been suggested. These include gains in information acquired about cell density, information about the frequency of phenotypes in the vicinal population, and access to information about physical flow conditions [38–41]. Our social selection model does not contradict those alternatives and may promote them by driving the initial fixation of the redundant network design, which can, subsequently, be further modified for other adaptive advantages.\n\nSeveral processes may limit the accumulation of quorum-sensing systems. First, each system contributes a signaling cost [5,42]. Second, the facultative return to cooperation may not be complete, leading to reduced benefit during exploitation in structured populations. Third, social selection of facultative characters is weak and can lead to variable mutation selection balance [34]. Finally, rareness of available systems and the need to integrate them appropriately into the existing network may limit the rate of accumulation. Further work will be required to define the importance of each of these mechanisms.\n\nExploitation can also occur between species; not only between variants within species. For example, cooperative secretion of antibiotic degrading enzymes has been shown to lead to coexistence of secreting and nonsecreting genotypes, at both the species and interspecific levels [43,44]. Accumulation of additional quorum-sensing systems could also be used to exploit species that produce fewer signals. This ecological factor may contribute to the continuous selection for maintenance of multiple systems. More generally, our results point to the roles facultative cheating and kin recognition may have in the ecology of complex microbial communities.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nGrowth Media and Conditions\n\nRoutine growth was performed in Luria—Bertani (LB) broth: 1% tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 0.5% NaCl. Experiments with B. subtilis were done using Spizizen minimal medium (SMM): 2 g L−1 (NH4)2SO4, 14 g L−1K2HPO4, 6 g L−1KH2PO4, 1 g L−1disodium citrate, 0.2 g L−1MgSO4∙7H2O. This was supplemented with trace elements (125 mg L−1MgCl2∙6H2O, 5.5 mg L−1CaCl2, 13.5 mg L−1FeCl2∙6H2O, 1 mg L−1MnCl2∙4H2O, 1.7 mg L−1ZnCl2, 0.43 mg L−1CuCl2∙4H2O, 0.6 mg L−1CoCl2∙6H2O, 0.6 mg L−1 Na2MoO4∙2H2O). Unless otherwise noted, 0.5% glucose was used as carbon source. Petri dishes for routine procedures were solidified using 1.5%agar (Difco).\n\nAntibiotic concentrations: Macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS; 1 μg ml−1 erythromycin, 25 μg ml−1 lincomycin); Spectinomycin (Sp, 100 μg ml−1); Tetracycline (Tet, 10 μg ml−1 for B. subtilis); Kanamycin (Km, 5 μg ml−1); Chloramphenicol (Cm, 15 μg ml−1); Ampicillin (Amp, 100 μg ml−1); Carbenicillin (Carb, 300 μg ml−1). Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) was added to the medium at the indicated concentration when appropriate.\n\nPremeasurement Bacillus growth protocol: Prior to all measurements, an overnight colony from an LB agar plate was inoculated in 1 mL SMM liquid medium and grown for 7 h until an OD600 of 0.1–0.3 was reached. The cultures were diluted by a factor of 106 and grown overnight at 37°C. Overnight cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and diluted to an OD600 of 0.01. We find that this long incubation in minimal medium both reduced the effects of quorum sensing prior to growth and reduced the arbitrary difference in growth between two cocultured wild-type colonies.\n\nFor coculture experiments, cells of different strains were mixed in appropriate ratios after overnight growth in SMM, based on relative optical density (OD). The exact ratios were subsequently measured using flow cytometry.\n\nPeptide Synthesis\n\nSynthetic pentapeptides PhrF (NH2 QRGMI COOH) and PhrC (NH2 ERGMT COOH) were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai, China) at &gt;98% purity. 10 mM aliquots were prepared by resuspension of the lyophilized peptides in H2O and stored at −20°C.\n\nFlow Cytometry\n\nSamples were analyzed on a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter), equipped with four lasers (405 nm, 488 nm colinear with 561 nm, 638 nm). The emission filters used were: BFP– 450/50, YFP/GFP– 525/40, mCherry– 620/30. Events were discriminated using the forward-scatter parameter. For each run, discrimination enabled a single, well-defined population to appear in the forward-scatter (FS) by side-scatter plot. Gating on the fluorescent populations and inspection of the nondiscriminated forward by side-scatter plot indicated that over 99.9% of the fluorescent cells are present in the discriminated population. In all analyzed samples, only single cells were considered by gating on correlated time-of-flight and FS events. Gating of the different fluorescent populations was performed by inspection of the log-log FLx by FLy plots (where x &amp; y represent the appropriate filter number for each fluorescent marker), where two distinct populations were clearly visible, resulting in type-I and type-II errors of less than 0.05%. For each run, at least 100,000 cells were analyzed and the total events analyzed such that the minority population was never below 1,000 events.\n\nSwarming Experiments\n\nCells were grown as described in the premeasurement growth protocol. Five microliters of diluted cultures were placed at the centers of 0.7% agar plates containing 25 mL of SMM medium supplemented with trace elements and 0.05% glucose. The plates were prepared 1 h prior to inoculation, allowed to solidify in room temperature, and dried for 5 min in a laminar flow chamber. The plates were incubated at 30°C for up to 72 h. The swarms were collected after suspension in 5 ml of PBS, the OD was measured, and the final ratios or the gene expression was determined using flow cytometry as described above. For spatial analysis of swarming, samples were taken from the centers of the plates, in addition to several samples 1 cm and 2 cm from the center. We find that a glucose concentration of 0.05% compared to 0.5% reduced the residual swarming of the comA mutant, increasing the difference in growth between the mutant and the wild-type, likely because residual production of surfactin by the mutant colony was reduced.\n\nB. subtilis Gene Expression Experiments\n\nIn all experiments, YFP level was determined from the median level of the unimodal distribution of YFP expressing cells using flow cytometry. YFP level was normalized by the autofluorescence of the wild-type. For coculture experiments (Fig 3A and 3B), samples were taken at several time points, and the OD600 and YFP levels were measured by flow cytometry. The expected YFP level at OD600 = 1 was calculated by interpolation.\n\nRegulatory gates\n\nThree separate experiments were performed to measure the PsrfA-YFP expression levels as a function of dual combinations of different autoinducers (Fig 3C and 3D and S4 Fig). In each of the experiments, the relevant strain was grown to a set OD, when different concentrations of the relevant autoinducers were added to different aliquots and incubated for 90 min, after which YFP was measured using flow cytometry. For the PhrF-PhrC gate (Fig 3C), cells of strain AES2636 were grown to OD of 0.6 when different concentrations of the two synthetic peptides were added to different aliquots. For the ComXROH-1-ComX168 gate (Fig 3D), cells of strain AES2278 were grown to OD ~0.001. Different 250 μl aliquots were then complemented with 250 μl of a composite conditioned media. Composite conditioned media was composed of varying fractions of conditioned media prepared from three strains: AES2202 (producing ComXRO-H-1), AES2277 (producing ComX168) and AES2135 (not producing ComX), which were grown to OD600 of 1.0 prior to preparation of the conditioned media. For the PhrF-ComX gate, cells of strain AES2672 were grown to an OD600 of ~0.001. Aliquots were then supplemented with varying concentrations of PhrF and 250 μl aliquots of a composite conditioned media mixture of conditioned media from strains AES2277 and AES2135. The PhrF-ComX168 and ComXROH-1-ComX168 gates were measured at low OD600 to prevent accumulation of ComX autoinducers produced by the reporter strains (which are not deleted for the comX genes).\n\nV. harveyi Coculture Assays\n\nV. harveyi strains were grown at 30°C in Luria-marine (LM) medium with aeration. Following overnight growth, samples were diluted to OD600 = 0.005 with varying ratios of dark and bright strains. Following 6.5 h of growth, bioluminescence was measured on a Tri-Carb 2810 TR (Perkin Elmer) scintillation counter. Dilutions of the cultures were made and plated on LM agar plates. Plates were incubated at 30°C overnight to allow colony formation. Images of the plates were taken using an ImageQuant LAS system that detects both bioluminescence and total colony forming units (CFUs). Colonies were counted using the ImageQuant TL and ImageJ programs. Values shown are calculated as (total bioluminescence)/(# bioluminescent CFUs). The values were normalized to the bioluminescence per cell of the bright strain.\n\nStrain Construction\n\nAll strains are detailed in S1 Table, while respective primers are provided in S2 Table.\n\nB. subtilis\n\nAll of the mutations and constructs were transferred to PY79 by transformation [45]. Integration of amyE integration plasmids into the zjd89::amyEΩ Cm Km [46] was done as previously described [26].\n\nDeletion of rapF-phrF, rapC-phrC, comA, and comQXP from the PY79 chromosome and their replacement with the MLS resistance cassette was performed through the long flanking homology PCR method [47] using the primers rapF-P1-P4, rapC-P1-P4, comA-P1-P4, and comQXP-P1-P4, respectively (S2 Table). The rapFphrF::Cm deletion was generated using the antibiotic switching vector ece76. rapFphrF::Cm was next used as a template to generate rapFphrF::Tet using the antibiotic switching vector ece75 (S1 Table).\n\nTo generate inducible zjd89::(Phyperspank-rapF) and amyE::(Phyperspank-rapC) constructs, a PCR product containing the relevant open reading frame was amplified using the primer pairs hsRapF-F/hsRapF-R andhsRapC-F/hsRapC-R. The PCR products were digested with the appropriate enzymes (S2 Table) and ligated downstream of the hyperspank promoter of the pDR111 vector containing Spec resistance [48].\n\nConstruction of sacA::(comQXPRO-H-1 Cm) was performed by PCR amplification of comQXP from strain B. mojavensis RO-H-1 using the comQXP-ROH1-F and comQXP-ROH1-R primer pair. The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI and ligated to the ece174 plasmid (S1 Table). The resulting vector was integrated into the sacA site on the chromosome using Cm resistance for selection.\n\nConstruction of sacA::(Psrf-3xyfp Cm) was performed by PCR amplification of Psrf-3xyfp using AEC945 as a template and the Psrf-sacA-F/Psrf-sacA-R primer pair. The PCR fragment was digested with the appropriate enzymes (S2 Table) and ligated to the ece174 plasmid. The resulting vector was integrated into the sacA site on the chromosome using Cm resistance for selection.\n\nThe swrA+ mutation allele is a spontaneous revertant that was selected by plating swrA−sfp+ cells on 0.7% LB agar plates and selecting motile variants, as was done previously [28]. The reconstituted swrA+ allele was verified by sequencing.\n\nThe sfp+ allele was amplified from the undomesticated strain B. subtilis NCBI3610 and fused to a spectinomycin resistance cassette by PCR using primers sfp-P1-P4 (S2 Table).\n\nThe constitutive fluorescent construct P43-yfp was synthesized by Genewiz, and sub-cloned into ece137 using BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes.\n\nV. harveyi\n\nPlasmid pBB1131 (pLAFR2/luxCDABE::Tn5) was conjugated into strains BB120 (WT) and HLS252 (ΔluxMN). The luxCDABE::Tn5 region was transferred to the endogenous luxCDABE locus on the chromosome to generate the dark strains. In pBB1131 the Tn5 is located in the luxA gene.\n\nModeling\n\nModeling of social interactions, signaling, and growth of the different organisms was done using regular differential equations, which describe the kinetic interactions between the molecular components of the quorum-sensing signal transduction process, cell growth kinetics and its dependence on nutrient availability, and public goods production. The equations were either analytically treated or solved numerically using Matlab (Mathworks). The specific equations used and a discussion of their relevance to the known biological data are provided in S1 File.\n\nSupporting Information"
