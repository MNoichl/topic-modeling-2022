  "fullText": "In PLoS Biology, volume 5, issue 5: doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050117\n\nWe would like to acknowledge that the 5‚ cis-regulatory element referred to in our paper as 7-mer had been previously named TAGteam (John R. ten Bosch, Joseph A. Benavides, Thomas W. Cline, [see reference number 22 in our paper]). The authors provide functional evidence that this element functions as an enhancer during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, a conclusion that is supported by our results but that we did not discuss in the text. We also apologize to the Cline lab for not having cited the 2003 Genetics paper where the authors first demonstrated functional activity of this cis-element for the transcriptional activation of scute/sisB.\n\nWrischnik LA, Timmer JR, Megna LA, Cline TW (2003) Recruitment of the proneural gene scute to the Drosophila sex-determination pathway.
