  "fullText": "Introduction\n            \nBacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella\n                    enterica swim by rotating multiple flagella, which arise randomly over\n                the cell surface. Each flagellum is a huge protein complex made up of about 30\n                different proteins and can be divided into three distinct parts: the basal body, the\n                hook, and the filament. The basal body is embedded in the cell envelope and acts as\n                a reversible motor powered by a proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane.\n                The hook and the filament extend outwards in the cell exterior. The filament is a\n                helical propeller that propels the cell body. The hook connects the basal body with\n                the filament and functions as a universal joint to transmit torque produced by the\n                motor to the filament. The flagellar motor can exist in either a counterclockwise\n                (CCW) or clockwise (CW) rotational state. CCW rotation causes the cell to swim\n                smoothly in what is termed a run, whereas brief CW rotation of one or more flagella\n                causes a tumble. The direction of motor rotation is controlled by environmental\n                signals that are processed by a sensory signal transduction pathway to generate\n                chemotaxis behavior [1]–[3].\n\nFive flagellar proteins, MotA, MotB, FliG, FliM, and FliN, are involved in torque\n                generation. Two integral membrane proteins, MotA and MotB, form the stator, which\n                converts an inwardly directed flux of H+ ions through a\n                proton-conducting channel into the mechanical work required for motor rotation. The\n                FliG, FliM, and FliN proteins form the C ring on the cytoplasmic side of the MS\n                ring, which is assembled from 26 subunits of a single protein, FliF, and this\n                complex acts as the rotor of the flagellar motor [1]–[3]. An electrostatic interaction\n                between the cytoplasmic loop of MotA and FliG is thought to be involved in torque\n                generation [4],[5] and in stator assembly around the rotor [6]. The\n                protonation-deprotonation cycle of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue in MotB\n                is coupled to the movement of the MotA cytoplasmic loop to generate torque [7]–[9].\n\nBecause FliG, FliM, and FliN are also responsible for switching the direction of\n                motor rotation, their assembly is called the switch complex [10]. Binding of a chemotactic\n                signaling protein CheY-phosphate (CheY-P) to FliM and FliN is presumed to induce\n                conformational changes in FliG that result in a conformational rearrangement of the\n                rotor-stator interface, allowing the motor to spin in the CW direction [11],[12]. The switching\n                probability is also affected by motor torque, suggesting that the switch complex\n                senses the stator-rotor interaction as well as the concentration of CheY-P [13],[14]. Recently,\n                turnover of FliM and heterogeneity in the number of FliM subunits within functioning\n                motors have been reported [15],[16]. The turnover rate is increased by the presence of\n                CheY-P, implying that turnover of FliM may be directly involved in the switching\n                process [15].\n\nFliG forms a ring on the cytoplasmic face of the MS ring with 26-fold rotational\n                symmetry [17],[18]. FliG consists of three domains, FliGN,\n                    FliGM, and FliGC. FliGN is responsible for\n                association with the cytoplasmic face of the MS ring [17],[19], and FliGM and\n                    FliGC are required for an interaction with FliM [20]. The FliGM domains of\n                adjacent subunits are fairly close to each other in the FliG ring [21]. The crystal\n                structure of FliGMC of Thermotaoga martima\n                    (Tm-FliGMC) shows that FliGM and FliGC are\n                connected by an extended α-helical linker (helix E) [22]. The linker contains two\n                well-conserved Gly residues and hence might be flexible [22]. This finding is supported by\n                genetic analyses of FliG and a computer-generated prediction of its secondary\n                structure [23],[24]. Critical charged residues, which are responsible for an\n                interaction with MotA [4]–[6], are clustered together along a prominent ridge on\n                    FliGC\n                [25]. It has been\n                shown that the elementary process of torque generation by the stator-rotor\n                interaction is symmetric in CCW and CW rotation [26], although the torque-speed\n                curves are distinct between them [27].\n\nA recent report on the full-length FliG structure of Aquifex\n                    aeolicus has shown two distinct conformational differences between the\n                full-length FliG and FliGMC structures [28]. The helix E linker is held in a\n                closed conformation by packing tightly against an α-helix (helix n), which\n                connects FliGN to FliGM in a way similar as helix E connects\n                    FliGM and FliGC in the full-length FliG structure. Helix E\n                is dissociated from FliGM in the Tm-FliGMC structure,\n                resulting in its being in an open conformation. The conformation of FliGC\n                is also different in these two structures. Combined with the previous genetic data,\n                it has been proposed that the closed conformation represents FliG during CCW\n                rotation and that switching to CW rotation may be accompanied by the dissociation of\n                helix E from FliGM to form an open conformation.\n\nThe S. enterica FliG(ΔPAA) mutant protein has three-amino-acid\n                deletion at positions 169 to 171. Motors containing this protein are extremely CW\n                biased [29]. The\n                mutant motors remain in CW rotation even in the presence of a cheY\n                deletion, indicating that the motor is locked in the CW state [29]. Therefore, it is likely\n                that binding of CheY-P to FliM may introduce a conformational change in FliG similar\n                to the one introduced by the in-frame PAA deletion. To elucidate the switching\n                mechanism, we crystallized a fragment of a T. maritima FliG mutant\n                variant, FliGMC(ΔPEV), which contains a deletion equivalent to\n                    S. enterica FliGMC(ΔPAA), and determined its\n                structure at 2.3 Å resolution. Based on the structural difference among\n                full-length A. aeolicus FliG, wild-type Tm-FliGMC, and\n                its deletion variant, we suggest that a reorientation of helix E relative to\n                    FliGM is important for switching and propose a new model for the\n                arrangement of FliG subunits in the motor.\n\n            Results\n            \n                Characterization of S. enterica fliG(ΔPAA)\n                    Mutant\n                \nThe motors of the fliG(ΔPAA) mutant rotated only CW (Figure\n                    S1A), whereas wild-type motors rotated exclusively CCW under our\n                    experimental conditions. The motors of the deletion mutant produced normal\n                    torque under a wide range of external-load conditions, indicating that the\n                    deletion does not affect the torque generation step (Figure\n                    S1B). Introduction of a cheA-Z deletion, which causes\n                    wild-type motors to spin exclusively CCW [30], into the\n                        fliG(ΔPAA) mutant did not change the CW-locked\n                    behavior. These results are in good agreement with a previous report [29].\n\nSwitching between the CW and CCW states is highly cooperative [31]–[34]. The switching\n                    mechanism can be explained by a conformational spread model, in which a\n                    switching event is mediated by conformational changes in a ring of subunits that\n                    spread from subunit to subunit via nearest-neighbor interactions [34],[35]. Therefore we\n                    investigated rotation of a single motor composed of wild-type and mutant FliG\n                    subunits at different ratios. FliG(ΔPAA) inhibited expansion of wild-type\n                    colonies in semi-solid agar (Figure\n                        1A), even when its expression level was ca. 5-fold lower than the\n                    level of wild-type FliG expressed from the chromosome (Figure 1B). Bead assays revealed that the\n                    decrease in colony expansion results from an increase in both switching\n                    frequency and prolonged pausing (Figure 1C). In addition, a low level expression of FliG(ΔPAA)\n                    partially increased the colony expansion of the ΔcheA-Z\n                    smooth-swimming mutant, presumably because switching now occurred (Figure 1D, upper and middle\n                    panels). These results suggest that even a small fraction of FliG(ΔPAA) in a\n                    motor can affect the CW-CCW switching.\n\nThe CW-CCW transition, which is very fast in wild-type motors, became\n                    significantly longer in mixed motors (Figure 1), suggesting that, as proposed\n                    previously [24], the motor can exist in multiple states. A much\n                    higher expression of FliG(ΔPAA) completely inhibited wild-type motility\n                        (Figure 1D) and did not\n                    increase the colony size of the ΔcheA-Z mutant in\n                    semi-solid agar plates because of the extreme CW-biased rotation of its flagella\n                        (Figure 1C and D, lower\n                    panel), in agreement with data showing that a higher expression level of\n                    wild-type FliG is required for complementation of the\n                    fliG(ΔPAA) mutant (Figure S2). Therefore, we conclude that\n                    wild-type FliG is more stable in the CCW state than in the CW state, whereas\n                    FliG(ΔPAA) is more stable in the CW state than in the CCW state.\n\n                Limited Proteolysis of FliG and FliG(ΔPAA)\n                \nTo identify structural differences between the CW and CCW states of FliG, we\n                    carried out limited trypsin proteolysis of the wild-type and mutant FliG\n                    proteins and analyzed the products by matrix-assisted laser desorption\n                    ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and N-terminal\n                    amino-acid sequencing (Figure\n                        2). Both the wild-type and mutant FliG proteins were cleaved between\n                    helix E and FliGC, producing the T1 and T2a fragments. This indicates\n                    that there is a flexible region between them. The T1 fragment derived from\n                    FliG(ΔPAA) was less stable than the T1 fragment from wild-type FliG,\n                    suggesting that the deletion causes a conformational change in FliGM\n                    and helix E. In contrast, the T2a fragment was more stable in FliG(ΔPAA)\n                    than in the wild-type. The T2a fragment derived from the wild-type FliG protein\n                    was detected by MALDI-TOF but not on SDS-PAGE gels, indicating that the\n                    wild-type T2a fragment is rapidly converted into the T2 fragment. These results\n                    suggest that the deletion also influences the conformation in the region between\n                    helix E and FliGC.\n\n                Structural Comparison of Tm-FliGMC and\n                    Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV)\n                \nWe tried crystallizing both wild-type FliG and FliG(ΔPAA) from S.\n                        enterica but did not succeed in obtaining crystals. It has been\n                    reported that the crystal structure of a fragment (residues 104–335) of\n                        T. martima FliG (Tm-FliGMC) consists of\n                        FliGM, FliGC, and helix E connecting the two domains\n                        ([22]; PDB\n                    ID, 1lkv). FliGC can be further divided into two sub-domains\n                        (FliGCN and FliGCC). Therefore, we introduced the\n                    deletion (ΔPEV), equivalent to ΔPAA, into Tm-FliGMC\n                        (Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV)) and determined its structure at 2.3 Å\n                    resolution by X-ray crystallography (Figure 3).\n\nFliGM, FliGCN, and FliGCC are composed of five\n                    (n, A–D), three (F–H), and six (I–N) helices, respectively\n                        (Figure 3). Since the\n                    residues between G186 and V195 are invisible in the crystal, there are two\n                    possible ways to connect FliGM with FliGCN: one is to\n                    connect FliGM with its adjacent FliGCN (G186 to V195 in\n                        Figure 3A upper panel\n                    and Figure\n                        S3A), and the other is with a distant FliGCN (G186 to\n                    V195' in Figure 3A\n                    upper panel and Figure S3A). The Cα distance between G186 and V195, and G186 and\n                    V195' is 16.9 Å and 27.9 Å, respectively. Therefore, to connect\n                    with the distant FliGCN, the invisible chain would have a fully\n                    extended conformation. We thus conclude that the connection with the adjacent\n                        FliGCN is more plausible.\n\nCompared with the structure of wild-type Tm-FliGMC, FliG(ΔPEV)\n                    showed a significant conformational change in the hinge between helix E and\n                        FliGM, leading to a very different orientation of helix E\n                    relative to FliGM (Figure 3A and B, and Figure 4A and C). As a result, some of the residues in\n                        FliGM are exposed to solvent in the\n                    Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) structure. This result is in good agreement with\n                    the data obtained by limited proteolysis (Figure 2). Thus, the conformational\n                    difference in the FliGM-helix E hinge between the wild-type and\n                    mutant structures may represent the conformational switch between the CW and CCW\n                    states of the motor.\n\nThe C-terminal half of helix E is disordered and protrudes into the solvent\n                    channel in the Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) crystal (Figure\n                    S3A). In contrast, helix E in the wild-type crystal is stabilized by\n                    forming an anti-parallel four-helix bundle structure with the E helices of three\n                    adjacent subunits related by crystallographic symmetry (Figure S3B)\n                        [22].\n                    Therefore, the orientation of FliGC relative to FliGM is\n                    different between the wild-type and the deletion variants (Figure 3A and B upper panel). Because the\n                    disordered region of helix E is far from the PEV deletion, we conclude that\n                    helix E has a highly flexible nature, which may be responsible for the switching\n                    mechanism, as suggested before [23],[24].\n\nTm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) also showed a conformational difference in the\n                    H–I loop, resulting in a rigid body movement of FliGCC relative\n                    to FliGCN (Figure 3A and\n                        B middle and lower panels, and Figure 4A). This movement is consistent with\n                    the limited proteolysis data because, in the Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV)\n                    structure, FliGCC almost covers D199, which is the residue\n                    corresponding to R198 in S. enterica FliG. It is, however,\n                    unclear how the deletion affects the conformation of the H–I loop, because\n                    neither direct contact between FliGCC and helix E nor significant\n                    structural difference in FliGCN is observed.\n\n                Comparison of the Structure of Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) with A.\n                        aeolicus FliG\n                \nThe crystal structure of full-length A. aeolicus FliG (Aa-FliG)\n                    showed that the conformation of helix E and the orientation of FliGCN\n                    relative to FliGCC are quite distinct from those of wild-type\n                        Tm-FliGMC\n                    [28]. We compared\n                    the Aa-FliG structure with the Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) structure and\n                    found that the conformation of helix E and the relative conformation of\n                        FliGCC to FliGCN are also different in those two\n                    structures (Figure 3A and C,\n                    and Figure 4B and C). The\n                    conformational differences are greater than those between Tm- FliGMC\n                    and Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV). The conformation of helix E in Aa-FliG seems\n                    to be stabilized by interactions of helix E with FliGM and helix n in\n                    the crystal (Figure S3C). As mentioned earlier, the conformation of helix E and\n                    the orientation of FliGCC to FliGCN are also different\n                    between the wild-type and mutant Tm-FliGMC structures. Therefore,\n                    these conformational differences among the three structures strongly suggest\n                    that both helix E and the linker connecting FliGCN to\n                        FliGCC are highly flexible.\n\n                Interaction between FliGM and FliGCN\n                \nThe interaction between FliGM and FliGCN, which share the\n                    armadillo repeat motif [36] that is often responsible for protein-protein\n                    interaction, is very tight in the Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) crystal, in\n                    agreement with a previous report [28]. FliGM and FliGCN can be\n                    identified as a single domain, although it is unclear whether the two domains\n                    belong to the same molecule or not because the residues between Gly-186 and\n                    Val-195 are invisible in the crystal (Figures 3A and S3A). The\n                    interaction surface between FliGM and FliGCN is formed by\n                    the C-terminal portion of αB, αC, and αD of FliGM, and\n                    αF, αG, and the N-terminal portion of αH of FliGCN,\n                    respectively (Figure 5A and\n                        B). The interface is highly hydrophobic. Ala-143, Ala-144, Leu-147,\n                    Leu-156, Leu-159, Ile-162, and Ala163 of FliGM, and Ile-204, Met-205,\n                    Leu-208, Ile-216, Leu-220, Leu-227, and Ile-231 of FliGCN are mainly\n                    involved in the tight domain interaction. Leu-159 is located at the center of\n                    the hydrophobic interface (Figure\n                        5C). Around the hydrophobic core, hydrophilic interactions between\n                    Arg-167 and Glu-230, and Gln-155 and Thr-212, also contribute to the domain\n                    interaction (Figure 5C).\n                    These interactions are also conserved in the wild-type Tm-FliGMC and\n                    Aa-FliG crystals, in which FliGM interacts with FliGCN of\n                    an adjacent molecule related by crystallographic symmetry (Figures 3 and S3B). The\n                        FliGM-FliGCN unit in the wild-type\n                        Tm-FliGMC structure can be superimposed onto that in\n                        Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) with root mean square deviation of 0.46\n                    Å for corresponding Cα atoms (Figure 4A and C), and that in Aa-FliG with\n                    0.79 Å (Figure 4B and\n                        C). These observations support the idea that the\n                        FliGM-FliGCN unit is a functionally relevant structure\n                        [28]. This is\n                    in good agreement with the previous mutational study showing that most of the\n                    known point mutations that affect FliM-binding [37] are located either on the\n                    bottom surface of the FliGM-FliGCN unit or on the\n                    interaction surface between FliGM and FliGCN (Figure 6A and C).\n\n            Discussion\n            \nThe default direction of the wild-type flagellar motor of Salmonella\n                    enterica is CCW, and the binding of CheY-P to FliM and FliN increases\n                the probability of CW rotation. CheY-P binding induces conformational changes in\n                FliM and FliN that are presumably transmitted to FliG, which directly interacts with\n                MotA to produce torque [1],[2]. Mutations located in and around helix E FliG, which\n                connects the FliGM and FliGC domains, generate a diversity of\n                phenotype, including motors that are strongly CW biased, infrequent switchers, rapid\n                switchers, and transiently or permanently paused, suggesting that helix E is\n                directly involved in the switching of the flagellar motor [24]. However, it remains unclear\n                how helix E affects the switch.\n\nTo investigate the switching mechanism, we characterized an extreme CW-biased\n                    S. enterica mutant in which an in-frame deletion of three\n                residues, Pro-169, Ala-170, and Ala-171, in FliG caused an extreme CW-biased\n                rotation even in the absence of CheY. Motors containing the FliG(ΔPAA) protein\n                showed normal torque generation under a wide range of external-load conditions\n                    (Figure 1 and Figure 1S). Thus, the\n                conformational change in FliG induced by ΔPAA is presumably similar to one\n                induced by CheY-P binding to FliM and FliN. Limited proteolysis revealed that\n                ΔPAA induces conformational changes in the hinge between FliGM and\n                helix E (Figure 2). This result\n                is in agreement with the crystal structure of Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV), which\n                shows that the orientation of helix E relative to FliGM has changed\n                significantly compared to wild-type FliG (Figure 3).\n\nFliG forms a ring on the cytoplasmic face of the MS ring [17],[18]. In vivo disulfide\n                cross-linking experiments using Cys-substituted FliG proteins have suggested that\n                helix A is close to the D–E loop of the adjacent FliG molecule in the FliG\n                ring [21]. Both a\n                conserved EHPQR motif in FliGM and a conserved surface-exposed\n                hydrophobic patch of FliGCN are important for the interactions with FliM\n                    [21]. Because\n                the conserved charged residues on helix M in FliGCC are responsible for\n                its interaction with MotA [4],[5],[25], which is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane, helix M\n                must lie on top of FliGCC\n                [21],[28]. Considering those\n                facts in light of the crystal structure of Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) described\n                here, we propose a new model for arrangement of FliG subunits in the motor (Figures 6 and 7).\n\nIn the proposed model, the conserved charged residues on helix M are located on the\n                top of the FliGM-FliGC unit and the EHPQR motif is present at\n                the bottom of the unit (Figure 6B and\n                    C). The conserved hydrophobic patch, and most of the point mutation sites\n                involved in the interaction with FliM, is localized at the bottom of the\n                    FliGMFliGCN units around the EHPQR motif or on the\n                interface between the FliGM and FliGCN. The D–E loop and\n                helix E interact with the FliGM domain in the neighboring subunit, in\n                agreement with data of in vivo cross-linking experiments, which show that residues\n                117 and 120 (118 and 121 in T. martima) on helix A of one subunit\n                lie close to residues 166 and170 (167 and 171 in T. martima) on the\n                D–E loop of the neighboring subunit [21]. In fact, these residues are\n                very close to each other in our model in positions in which disulfide-crosslinking\n                should occur. Moreover, the position of Cys residues that do not participate in\n                disulfide cross-linking are far from each other in the model (Figure 6D).\n\nOur model can also explain the results of mutational studies of CW and CCW-biased\n                    fliG mutants [37],[38]. The mutation sites are widely distributed from helix A\n                to the H–I loop. Most of them are localized in three regions in our model\n                    (Figure 6A and B). In the\n                first region, the CCW-biased mutations, which are located on helix A, affect\n                residues close to residues targeted by CW-biased mutations, which are on a segment\n                between helix D and E of the adjacent subunit (Figure 6A and B, 1). Because these residues are distributed on the\n                interaction surface between the neighboring subunits, they presumably affect\n                cooperative changes in subunit conformation. A second cluster of residues targeted\n                by CW-biased mutations is located on the C-terminal half of helix B and the\n                E–F loop (Figure 6A and B,\n                    2). These mutations may\n                change the orientation of the E–F loop and probably alter the orientation of\n                helix E, resulting in unusual switching behavior. The third cluster of residues\n                affected by mutations causing a CW switching bias is located near the loop between\n                helices H and I (Figure 6A and\n                B, 3). This region\n                determines the relative orientation of FliGCC to the\n                    FliGM-FliGCN unit, and therefore the mutations may change the\n                orientation of FliGCC to cause anomalous switching behavior.\n\nHelix E is directly involved in the switching mechanism, but how does the structure\n                of helix E affect the orientation of the FliGM-FliGC unit?\n                Since the D–E loop and helix E interact with FliGM in the\n                neighboring subunit, we propose that a hinge motion of helix E may directly change\n                the orientation of the neighboring FliGM domain (Figure 7A). This mechanism could explain the\n                cooperative switching of the motor. The conformational changes of FliM induced by\n                association or dissociation of CheY-P may trigger conformational changes in the\n                    FliGM-FliGC unit that it contacts, leading to a large\n                change in the interaction between FliGCC and MotA. The conformational\n                change in one unit is probably accompanied by a conformational change in the loop\n                between FliGM and helix E. This change could influence the orientation of\n                the neighboring subunit through the interaction between helix E and FliGM\n                of the neighbor, thereby propagating the conformational change to the neighboring\n                subunit (Figure 7A).\n\nIf helix E actually contacts the more-distant FliGCN in the crystal\n                structure, an alternative interaction could be responsible for the cooperative\n                switching (Figure 7B). However,\n                the same general mechanism involving changes in the conformation of helix E would\n                still be responsible for the cooperative switching.\n\nRecently, Lee et al. have proposed a model for FliG arrangement and switching based\n                on the structural differences in Aa-FliG and Tm-FliGMC\n                [28]. In the crystal\n                structure of Aa-FliG, the hydrophobic patch in FliGM is covered by the\n                N-terminal hydrophobic residues of helix E (closed conformation), whereas the patch\n                is exposed in Tm-FliGMC (open conformation). Because mutations that may\n                disturb the hydrophobic interaction result in strong CW-bias in motor rotation [38], the\n                structures of Aa-FliG and Tm-FliGMC are proposed to be in the CCW and CW\n                states, respectively [28]. The hydrophobic patch is also exposed in the\n                    Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) structure, although the conformation of helix E\n                is different from that of Tm-FliGMC. Since ΔPAA in S.\n                    enterica FliG (ΔPEV in T. maritima) caused an\n                extreme CW-bias, it is possible that the dissociation of helix E from\n                    FliGM leads to CW rotation. In our model, however, the hydrophobic\n                patch of the FliGM is covered by the hydrophobic residues in the\n                C-terminal half of helix E of the adjacent subunit. This arrangement raises the\n                possibility that the closed conformation of helix E found in the Aa-FliG structure\n                is an artifact of crystal packing.\n\nLee et al. assume that the FliGM-FliGC unit is present in the\n                rotor ring, and hence is in agreement with the results of most of mutational\n                studies. However, the arrangement of the subunits and the mechanism of switching are\n                different than in our model. In their model, dynamic motion of helix E and helix n\n                induces a large conformational change of the FliGM-FliGC unit,\n                including the rotation of FliGM-FliGCN unit and relative to\n                the FliGCC to the unit, leading to a change in the arrangement of the\n                charged residues on helix M (Figure\n                    7C) [28].\n                Cooperative switching is explained by the strong interaction between\n                    FliGCN of one subunit and FliGCC of the adjacent subunit.\n                However, helix A of one subunit and the D–E loop of the adjacent subunit are\n                always at a considerable distance in both the CW and CCW states. Hence, their model\n                cannot explain the in vivo disulfide cross-linking experiments (Figure 7C) [21]. Since our new model can\n                explain the cross-linking data, it appears to be more plausible than the model\n                proposed by Lee et al. [28].\n\nAlthough our model is consistent with most of the previous experimental data, it\n                still contains ambiguity. The available density map of the basal body obtained by\n                electron cryo-microscopy is not high enough to allow fitting of the atomic model.\n                Thus, a higher-resolution rotor-ring structure will be required to build a more\n                precise model to explain the molecular mechanism of directional switching.\n\n            Materials and Methods\n            \n                Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media\n                \nS. enterica strains and plasmids used in this study are listed\n                    in Table 1.

Immunoblotting\n                    with polyclonal anti-FliG antibody was carried out as described [41].\n\n                Purification of His-FliG and His-FliG(ΔPAA) and Limited\n                    Proteolysis\n                \nHis-FliG and His-FliG(ΔPAA) were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography\n                    as described before [39].

N-terminal amino acid\n                    sequence was done as described before [42].\n\n                Purification, Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination\n                    of Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV)\n                \nTm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) was purified as described previously [23].

Initially,\n                    we tried to solve the structure by the molecular replacement method using\n                        Tm-FliGMC structure (PDB ID: 1 lkv) as a search model. However,\n                    no significant solution was obtained, even though individual domains were used\n                    as search models. Therefore, we prepared heavy-atom derivative crystals and\n                    determined the structure using the anomalous diffraction data from the\n                    derivatives.\n\nDerivative crystals were prepared by soaking in a reservoir solution containing\n                        K2OsCl6 at 50% (v/v) saturation for one day.\n                    Crystals of Tm-FliGMC(ΔPEV) and its Os derivatives were soaked in\n                    a solution containing 90%(v/v) of the reservoir solution and\n                    10%(v/v) 2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol for a few seconds, then immediately\n                    transferred into liquid nitrogen for freezing. All the X-ray diffraction data\n                    were collected at 100 K under nitrogen gas flow at the synchrotron beamline\n                    BL41XU of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan), with the approval of the Japan Synchrotron\n                    Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) (Proposal No. 2007B2049). The data were\n                    processed with MOSFLM [43] and scaled with SCALA [44]. Phase calculation\n                    was performed with SOLVE [45] using the anomalous diffraction data from\n                    Os-derivative crystals. The best electron-density map was obtained from MAD\n                    phases followed by density modification with DM [44]. The model was\n                    constructed with Coot [46] and was refined against the native crystal data to\n                    2.3 Å using the program CNS [47]. About 5% of the\n                    data were excluded from the data for the R-free calculation. During the\n                    refinement process, iterative manual modifications were performed using\n                    “omit map.” Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized\n                    in Tables\n                        S1 and S2, respectively.\n\n            Supporting Information"
