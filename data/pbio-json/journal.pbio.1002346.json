  "fullText": "The authors would like to clarify that the controls previously depicted in Figs 4E and 7A were for different experiments and were included in error.\n\nThe correct control for Fig 4E was located and used to prepare a corrected figure.\n\nThe correct control for the original Fig 7A could not be located; this panel has therefore been removed after a careful assessment and investigation determined that the result for which original Fig 7A was cited is supported elsewhere in this article, and that removal of this panel does not affect the conclusions of the paper.\n\nWe have also taken this opportunity to provide new versions of several figures (Figs 4, 5, 6, 7) in which gel/blot splices and a non-linear level adjustment were made but were not previously indicated or declared, or to replace incorrectly spliced gels/blots with the un-spliced originals. We also take the opportunity to correct two errors in the legend to Fig 6, first to remove a redundant and incorrect sentence, and second to address incorrect description of p values.\n\nThe text in the Results section titled “UCP2 Levels Increase in Food-Deprived Mice” has been edited to accommodate the removal of the original Fig 7A and the relabeling of Fig 7B, 7C and 7D as Fig 7A, 7B and 7C, respectively. The corrected text and Figs 4, 5, 6 and 7 are provided here.\n\nUCP2 Levels Increase in Food-Deprived Mice\n\nDoes the regulation of UCP2 play any role in the normal secretion of insulin in β cells of wild-type mice in response to diet? To address this question, we starved wild-type mice O/N and compared the levels of UCP2 in whole pancreas and in islets to mice feeding ad libitum. Importantly, we found an increase in levels of UCP2 protein in starved mice compared with fed mice (Fig 7A).\n\nIn order to determine whether Sirt1 regulated this induction of UCP2 in mice, we starved Sirt1 KO mice O/N and compared the effect of starvation on UCP2 protein levels to wild-type mice. Four pairs of wild-type and KO littermates were compared and gave comparable results. The levels of UCP2 in KO mice fed ad libitum were elevated compared with wild-type, as expected (Fig 7B). Most importantly, these elevated levels in the fed KO mice were not further induced by starvation. In contrast, starvation induced UCP2 in wild-type mice, as before. A similar pattern of UCP2 RNA induction by starvation in wild-type but not KO mice was observed by RT-PCR (Fig 7C). The above findings suggest that an increase in UCP2 in β cells is part of a normal mechanism to regulate the capacity of β cells to produce insulin. Moreover, this induction appears to be mediated by alleviation of Sirt1-mediated repression.\n\nThese findings suggest that starvation causes a decrease in Sirt1 activity in β cells. In yeast, Sir2p activity is regulated by the NAD/NADH ratio. We thus measured NAD and NADH in the pancreas of seven fed and seven starved wild-type mice. Strikingly, there was a significant decrease in the level of NAD but not NADH in the starved mice (Fig 8). The level of Sirt1 protein in starved pancreas is roughly comparable to fed controls (unpublished data). These findings suggest that changes in NAD levels in the pancreas regulate Sirt1 activity and insulin secretion in response to diet."
