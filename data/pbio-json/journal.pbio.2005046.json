  "abstract": "The microenvironment of lymphoid organs can aid healthy immune function through provision of both structural and molecular support. In mice, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) create an essential T-cell support structure within lymph nodes, while human FRCs are largely unstudied. Here, we show that FRCs create a regulatory checkpoint in human peripheral T-cell activation through 4 mechanisms simultaneously utilised. Human tonsil and lymph node–derived FRCs constrained the proliferation of both naïve and pre-activated T cells, skewing their differentiation away from a central memory T-cell phenotype. FRCs acted unilaterally without requiring T-cell feedback, imposing suppression via indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, adenosine 2A Receptor, prostaglandin E2, and transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFβR). Each mechanistic pathway was druggable, and a cocktail of inhibitors, targeting all 4 mechanisms, entirely reversed the suppressive effect of FRCs. T cells were not permanently anergised by FRCs, and studies using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells showed that immunotherapeutic T cells retained effector functions in the presence of FRCs. Since mice were not suitable as a proof-of-concept model, we instead developed a novel human tissue–based in situ assay. Human T cells stimulated using standard methods within fresh tonsil slices did not proliferate except in the presence of inhibitors described above. Collectively, we define a 4-part molecular mechanism by which FRCs regulate the T-cell response to strongly activating events in secondary lymphoid organs while permitting activated and CAR T cells to utilise effector functions. Our results define 4 feasible strategies, used alone or in combinations, to boost primary T-cell responses to infection or cancer by pharmacologically targeting FRCs.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nStromal cells create specialised lymphoid support compartments within secondary lymphoid organs. The signals they feed leukocytes have profound effects in many aspects of activation, proliferation, and differentiation [1].\n\nFibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) construct the internal segregated structure of secondary lymphoid organs by acting as a scaffold for lymphocyte migration and secreting chemokine C-C motif ligand 19 (CCL19) and chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) to bring T cells and dendritic cells to the central T-cell zone and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 13 (CXCL13) to bring B cells to outer B cell zones. Lymphocyte survival is further supported through secretion of survival factors interleukin 7 (IL-7) and B cell activating factor (BAFF) [2,3].\n\nSeveral papers demonstrated that mouse lymph node–derived FRCs reduce T-cell proliferation. In mice, when T cells have been activated less than 15 h, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)-driven prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is suppressive [4], while comparative neutralisation experiments showed that nitric oxide plays a larger role past 15 h, when most T-cell division occurs [5–7]. T-cell function is impaired, shown through reduced interferon gamma (IFNγ) production [6–7]. Effects on memory T-cell differentiation have not been assessed in mice.\n\nHuman FRCs are still almost entirely unstudied, though it has been shown that podoplanin (PDPN+) cells analogous to mouse FRCs are found in human secondary lymphoid organs and that they secrete extracellular matrix components as well as CCL21 [8,9]. A recent study, citing as-yet unpublished data, said that human FRCs do not produce nitric oxide in response to IFNγ activation [9]. We therefore questioned whether prior mouse FRC research accurately modelled human FRC biology. The effects of FRCs on human T cells are unknown, and their mechanism/s of action have not been tested, though COX2 is expressed [4,9].\n\nThe role of human FRCs in T-cell regulation is likely to be highly relevant to human health. Mouse studies show far-reaching effects of FRCs for immunity against influenza and other pathogens [3,10,11], and it is hypothesised that suppression of effector T-cell activation within lymph nodes reduces immune-mediated pathology against the lymph node structure [1,12]. Accordingly, virally infected FRCs are associated with T-cell persistence and chronic viral infection [12].\n\nHere, we show that human FRCs block proliferation and modulate differentiation of newly activated naïve human T cells, without requiring T-cell feedback. Suppression was constitutive, and we identified 4 molecular mechanisms operating simultaneously: indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), COX1 and 2 enzymes responsible for PGE2 production, adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). Coinhibition of these factors reversed FRC-mediated suppression in vitro and permitted us to observe T-cell activation on a living tonsil slice.\n\nIt is important to first understand the key cells and molecules involved in regulating T-cell activation during inflammation, infection, cancer, and autoimmunity in order to treat immune-mediated pathologies and immune deficiencies. Here, we show that human FRCs, via 4 pathways—which are druggable individually or in small combinations—are a likely pharmacological target to boost the primary immune response.\n\nResults\n\nTo test the effect of FRCs on naïve T-cell activation, we isolated and culture-expanded FRCs from either cadaver-origin lymph nodes or live-donor tonsils using a published digestion protocol [13] or through explant culture. Cultured FRCs used in this study were identified as CD45−, CD31−, PDPN+ cells across multiple passages, and they expressed genes and proteins characteristic of published FRC phenotypes from freshly isolated mouse and human FRCs [14,15] (S1 Fig), including expression of PDPN, CXCL12, α smooth muscle actin (αSMA; ACTA2), lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β, vimentin (VIM), detectable but low levels of BAFF, mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1), Desmin, CD34, and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). As expected, chemokines CCL21 and CCL19 were switched off by cultured cells; transcription in mice has been shown to be regulated by lymphatic flow [16]. We identified a distinct subset of stromal cells present in freshly isolated tonsil but missing from our cultures; these were CD45−CD31−EpCAM- CD90+ CD73− PDPN− cells (S1 Fig) with unknown function.\n\nWe activated carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled T-cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of human FRCs and found that they underwent fewer divisions after 96 h (Fig 1A and 1B). We then activated CFSE-labelled PBMCs and allowed T-cells to divide freely for 48 h. Cells were harvested and plated with or without FRCs and reactivated for a further 48 h. While reactivated T cells proliferated freely, the addition of FRCs after the initial activation and prior to the second activating stimulus imposed a significant brake on proliferation (Fig 1C). Thus, FRCs could hamper the proliferation of both naïve and pre-activated, actively divided T cells.\n\nNext, we examined surface marker expression changes in responding T cells. After 96 h of activation with or without FRCs, T cells showed normal up-regulation of early activation marker CD69, but significantly fewer T cells up-regulated the interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ra) chain, CD25 (Fig 1D). Together with data showing that FRCs could halt the proliferation of pre-activated T cells, these results suggested that the suppressive mechanism occurred well downstream of T-cell receptor ligation and did not involve steric hindrance. Suppression was responsive to dose (Fig 1E), and human FRCs did not produce nitric oxide when stimulated (Fig 1F).\n\nWe questioned whether FRCs may be inducing apoptosis or permanently anergising responding T cells. Cell cycle analysis showed no increase in apoptosis in either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (Fig 1G). Instead, in the presence of FRCs, fewer T cells entered the DNA-synthesis phase (S phase), compared to T cells that were not cocultured with FRCs (Fig 1H), with no change to G0/G1 or G2/M phase (S2 Fig). Separation of activated, suppressed T cells from FRCs, followed by reactivation alone in culture, showed that T cells were not permanently anergised by activation in the presence of FRCs (Fig 1I).\n\nWe probed the nature of the suppression mechanism by screening small molecular inhibitors, agonists, and blocking/neutralising antibodies in a similar coculture assay, in which CFSE-labelled T cells were activated in the presence or absence of FRCs and/or inhibitors and analysed after 4 days.\n\nInhibition or blockade of TGFβ receptor, IDO, COX1/2, and A2AR signalling all restored T-cell proliferation (Fig 2A–2D) to varying degrees, while interleukin 6 (IL-6) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition had no effect (Fig 2A–2D), and inhibitors did not alone significantly alter T-cell differentiation phenotypes (S3 Fig).\n\nAll 4 mechanisms were utilised in all donors but to varying degrees, with no conserved predominance (S4 Fig). This imposed challenges in how to most appropriately assess the overall effect of FRC suppression on T-cell biology in a meaningful manner, given human variance and the potential for redundancy. Donor-to-donor variance was minimal when all 4 mechanisms were targeted at once, and since all mechanisms were operational in all donors, we reasoned that this was the best means of assessing the net biological impact of FRCs on T cells. We therefore chose to suppress all mechanisms simultaneously to investigate downstream effects on T cells.\n\nTo assess whether these 4 molecular targets were together sufficient to entirely block FRC suppression, we created an inhibitory cocktail of all 4 inhibitors and treated PBMCs that were exposed to stimulatory signals for 96 h. In the presence of FRCs, proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 T cells occurred at control levels (Fig 2E and 2F). The inhibitor cocktail did not alone significantly increase T-cell proliferation in the absence of FRCs (Fig 2E and 2F).\n\nStrikingly, the presence of FRCs influenced the fate of differentiating naive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations (CD62L+CD45RO−). Their presence during T-cell activation decreased differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to a central memory phenotype (CD62L+CD45RO+) while increasing the proportion of CD4+ naïve (CD62L+CD45RO−) T cells. Effector (CD62L−CD45RO−) and effector memory phenotype T cells (CD62L− CD45RO+) and CD8+ naïve T cells were not affected (Fig 3A and 3B). Memory phenotype cells were further profiled by expression of CD27 and by relative proliferation; both subsets yielded expected phenotypes (S5 Fig). Blockade of TGFβR, IDO, COX1/2, and A2AR signalling reversed the effects (Fig 3A and 3B). Results were comparable regardless of whether anti-CD2/3/28-coated beads or PHA-L/IL-2 was used as the activating stimulus.\n\nSince CD25 is the alpha chain of the IL-2R, and since we observed selective inhibition of CD25 expression by FRCs (Fig 1D), which was present as early as 24 h after stimulation and did not occur in the presence of inhibitors (S6 Fig), this led us to question whether FRC-mediated effects on IL-2 signalling were evident. Coculture with FRCs did not alter signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation (Fig 4A and 4B), leading us to conclude that this signalling pathway was not mechanistically important; we tested other signalling molecules phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2), phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1), phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), phosphorylated STAT6 (pSTAT6), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and found no mechanistic insight within T cells (S7 Fig). IL-2 production, as a downstream transcriptional target of IL-2 signalling, was also not altered (Fig 4C). Together, these results demonstrated that an inhibition of the IL-2 signalling pathway was not driving T-cell suppression. Accordingly, the proportion of T regulatory cells (Tregs) was also neither increased nor decreased in stimulated cultures (S8A and S8B Fig), and depletion of CD25+ cells did not prevent FRC-mediated suppression (S8C Fig), suggesting that the effect of FRCs did not occur via cross-talk with Tregs.\n\nProduction of IFNγ and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were also unaffected by coculture with FRCs (Fig 4C), suggesting that while FRCs inhibit activation and differentiation of T cells, once T cells are active, their effector functions are not impaired. This finding was confirmed using antigen-activated chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (Fig 4D) and is a finding not reproduced in mouse models, in which IFNγ production is reduced following FRC coculture [6].\n\nGiven the broad differences here observed between mice and humans, we decided to test whether T-cell cross-talk with human FRCs was required for or important to suppression. In mice, having T cells and FRCs in close proximity is important, since separation by transwell blocks the majority of the suppressive effect of FRCs [5,6]. Residual suppression in the presence of the transwell is likely to be due to secretion of PGE2 [4]. Unlike mouse FRCs, suppression was retained when FRCs were separated from T cells by a cell-impermeable transwell barrier (Fig 4E). Moreover, FRC-conditioned media diluted 1:2 in complete media suppressed T-cell activation indistinguishably from FRCs (Fig 4F), showing that FRCs secrete suppressive factors constitutively and that, unlike mouse FRCs [5,6] or human mesenchymal stromal cells [7], they do not require cross-talk from activated T cells. Accordingly, steady-state cultured FRCs expressed high levels of PGE2 synthesis enzymes COX1 (PTSG1) and COX2 (PTSG2) (Fig 4G). COX1 is usually a constitutive source of PGE2, while COX2 is more commonly inflammation inducible yet was expressed in otherwise unstimulated FRC cultures (Fig 4G) [4]. COX2, A2AR, and transforming growth factor beta receptor type 2 (TGFβR2) protein staining was detectable on ERTR7+ T-zone FRCs (TRCs) present in frozen tonsil tissue sections (S9 Fig) from patients who were not suffering from infection at the time of surgery. We were unable to detect IDO staining, suggesting that this protein alone may be inducible under acute inflammatory conditions.\n\nAs a method of cross-confirmation to show that FRCs preproduce suppressive factors prior to seeing T cells, we preincubated FRCs with inhibitors, prior to a wash step, and then added T cells and an activation stimulus. T cells stimulated with pre-inhibited FRCs had high CD25 expression after 24 h, similar to FRCs with inhibitors and higher than uninhibited FRCs (S6 Fig), as also shown in Fig 1D. CD25 expression was used as a biomarker for FRC suppression of T cells, as T-cell division was not measurable until 48 h, and the pre-incubation step was, because of receptor turnover, not effective beyond 24 h.\n\nNext, we looked for a means to validate these in vitro results. Activation of T cells in situ on secondary lymphoid organ tissue slices has not previously been shown, to our knowledge. We decided to test whether this could be due to a suppressive effect of stromal cells, by stimulating T cells in situ within slices of freshly donated tonsil, in the presence or absence of the inhibitory cocktail. Tonsils were obtained within 2–4 h of surgery from healthy donors, immediately sectioned, and then incubated in media containing phytohaemagglutinin-L (PHA-L) and recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2), with or without the inhibitor cocktail added. After 96 h, T cells were imaged or isolated by mechanical disruption and analysed by flow cytometry.\n\nA significantly higher proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in active cell cycle (Ki67+) in the presence of the inhibitory cocktail, shown through flow cytometry (Fig 5A and 5B) and immunofluorescence (Fig 5C). Controls showed baseline expression (Fig 5A–5C). Immunofluorescent imaging showed increased Ki67 staining in the T-cell zone when inhibitors and the activating stimulus were both present (Fig 5C). Ki67 staining robustly reproduced in vitro results and demonstrated that it is possible to inhibit stromal-induced T-cell suppression in situ.\n\nTaken together, these results show that human FRCs strongly influence the activation and differentiation of naïve T cells by constraining initial proliferation and skewing their differentiation away from a central memory phenotype without altering effector cytokine production or signalling. Mechanisms of action involved PGE2, COX1/2, TGFβ, and A2AR. Coinhibition of these factors permitted us to observe T-cell activation on a living tonsil slice for the first time, to our knowledge.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIdentifying the cells and molecules that regulate T-cell activation during inflammation, infection, cancer, and autoimmunity is a fundamental first step towards creating effective therapies for immune-mediated pathologies and immune deficiencies. Human immunological studies are commonly carried out in vitro, with validation in mice. Here, we show that the presence of a human microenvironment influences T-cell activation both in vitro and in situ, with important functional and mechanistic differences from previous observations in mice.\n\nPrevious studies using mouse lymph nodes have established that FRCs are important for regulation of T-cell proliferation, largely through provision of nitric oxide [5–7] with an early role for PGE2 [4,6]. Changes to differentiation were not observed in mice, but FRCs did compromise effector cytokine production and therefore T-cell function [6].\n\nBy contrast, our results showed key differences to mice. Human FRCs utilised 4 pathways independent of nitric oxide to control T-cell proliferation and differentiation. Inhibiting TGFβR, A2AR, IDO, and COX1/2 completely reversed the suppressive effect of FRCs and restored differentiation of T cells with a central memory phenotype to normal levels. Similarly, the inhibition of these targets in situ using tonsil slices allowed T cells to overcome the prohibitive effect that stromal cells imposed.\n\nUnlike mice, bidirectional T-cell signalling to FRCs was not required for T-cell suppression or for expression of A2AR, TGFBR, and COX2 protein by TRCs. Expression of IDO was not detected, and it is expected that IDO is induced by acute inflammation, as reported in dermal and bone marrow fibroblasts [17]. It will be of interest in the future to explore the factors and kinetics governing its induction.\n\nOnce activated, polyclonal and CAR T cells both showed normal effector cytokine secretion, which again differs from mice. It is currently unclear whether these are bona fide biological differences between mice and humans or due to the preferential study of immunologically naïve mice raised in a specific pathogen-free environment. It would be interesting to see whether FRCs from mice that have undergone several rounds of a self-limiting infection would constitute a more representative model for human FRCs.\n\nThe finding that T-cell function in the presence of FRCs is maintained is highly relevant to cancer immunotherapy. Secondary lymphoid organs are a primary tumour site for lymphoma and leukaemia and a prominent metastatic site for many other cancers. They are an important site for transfused CAR T-cell activity, with one study showing CAR T cells heavily infiltrating lymph nodes of patients with lymphoma at &gt;30% of T cells [18] and another showing CAR T transcripts detectable in lymph nodes up to 3 mo post-infusion and at higher levels in lymph nodes than in blood [19]. Mouse data suggested that FRCs would limit IFNγ production by effector T cells; these results show that human FRCs only impose effects on naïve T-cell proliferation and differentiation and not effector function. Secretion of key effector cytokines IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2 is unchanged in the presence of FRCs after T cells are activated, which is the case for CAR T therapy.\n\nMuch like nitric oxide as a mechanism in mouse FRCs, human FRC molecular mechanisms are extremely complex, and the precise effects on T cells are not easily elucidated, despite their clear biological importance and decades of intense study. TGFβR signalling, the COX1 enzyme, A2AR, and IDO all have well-described suppressive effects on T-cell activation. But apart from IDO, none are uniformly anti-inflammatory; rather, each factor is capable of shaping the T-cell response in a complex manner dependent on the stimulus, costimulating factors, and the microenvironmental cytokine milieu [20,21]. As such, inhibitors targeting the molecules profiled in this study have been investigated for highly diverse applications. A2AR inhibitors, for example, are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (methotrexate [22]) while being investigated as an immunomodulatory treatment for cancer, for which the goal is inhibition of immunosuppression [23]. The level of TGFβ signalling to naïve T cells is an important factor in enforcing their quiescence, and naïve T cells in patients with autoimmunity have reduced expression of TGFβRI and increased capacity for T-cell proliferation [24], but TGFβ blockade enhances vaccine and immunotherapy responses [25]. With similar complexity, murine FRCs have a role in deletional and suppressive tolerance [5,6,26] while promoting healthy immune responses [3,10].\n\nIDO has a well-defined role in T-cell suppression. It oxidises tryptophan to kynurenine metabolites [27], which both deprives effector T cells of tryptophan, inducing proliferative arrest [28], and exposes them to immunosuppressive kynurenine, which can impair T-cell growth and survival [29]. IDO is a well-described mechanism of tumour immune evasion in mice [28] and shows direct effects in human T cells [30–32], though a phase 3 trial of combination IDO inhibitor and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibition recently failed to improve progression-free survival compared to PD-1 inhibitor immunotherapy alone (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02752074). IDO affects the earliest stages of TCR signalling through down-regulation of Vav1 and inhibition of F-actin reorganisation [30,31], as well as inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [29], and, as we observed, prevents cells progressing to S phase of the cell cycle [33].\n\nCOX1 and COX2 are enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis. Our inhibitor is capable of blocking both, but our data show that COX1 is a major mediator of FRC suppression, since FRC-conditioned media strongly suppressed T cells, and cultured FRCs only expressed COX1 constitutively. COX1 can also be involved in the earliest inflammatory events, after which COX2 becomes the predominant inflammatory isoform [34]. In humans, PGE2 is the most abundant member of the prostanoid family, and most PGE2 is secreted by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and stromal cells [21]. PGE2 is capable of mediating diverse effects depending on stimuli that are not well understood, but its role in suppression of T-cell activation and proliferation has been reported since 1971 [35], with newer studies also describing skewed differentiation [36] and induction of a suppressive phenotype in non-Treg CD4+ T cells, which were capable of suppressing the proliferation of other T cells undergoing activation [37]. Reported mechanisms include down-regulation of CD25, up-regulation of CD46, and altered responses to costimulation [36].\n\nExtracellular purinergic mediators, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine, are powerful immunomodulators. They signal through A2AR as an important step in the resolution of inflammation, providing well-described suppressive influences on the function of T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, platelets, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, fibroblasts, and neutrophils to prevent excessive tissue pathology [20,38,39]. Accordingly, methotrexate is a clinically important A2AR antagonist used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases [22]. Adenosine production is increased in inflammation and in low-oxygen-tension microenvironments, and activation of A2AR increases intracellular cAMP, which inhibits cytokine responses. Accordingly, inhibition of A2AR awakens tumour-reactive CD8+ T cells in mouse models [40]. The oxygen tension in human lymphoid organs is likely to be low: murine lymphoid organs exhibit low oxygen tension in vivo at 0.5%–4.5% oxygen, which impacts upon the speed at which effector T cells differentiate [41], and while data on healthy lymph nodes are lacking, low partial pressures are reported for other human organs and tissues [42].\n\nCertain human T-cell subsets are known to express CD39, which converts ATP to AMP [43], while human FRCs express high levels of CD73, which converts AMP to adenosine. A2AR signals reduce secretion of proinflammatory IL-1β and IL-6 [22], both of which are produced at high levels by FRCs in response to inflammation [11], and increases production of collagen I [44].\n\nTGFβ is a highly evolutionarily conserved immunomodulatory molecule [45]. Our inhibitor blocked signalling receptor component activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5; TGFβRI), whose signals are transduced by phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins [46]. TGFβRI−/− mice develop a lethal inflammatory disease [47], and neutralising TGFβ increases antitumour responses of CD8+ T cells [48]. However, TGFβ can impose both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in responding human T cells, depending on their differentiation state and inflammatory cytokines encountered [45]. As an anti-inflammatory agent, TGFβ inhibits CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clonal expansion and differentiation and inhibits the activation of high-affinity T cells [49–51], relevant to our findings, and it also promotes the survival of lower-affinity T cells. These effects can occur in a paracrine fashion by acting on APCs and other cells and by reducing CD25 expression [51]. TGFβ signalling blocks the clonal expansion of T cells in vivo and blocks differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 2 (Th2), and cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) T cells in favour of T helper 17 (Th17; in the presence of IL-6) or peripheral Treg (pTreg; in the presence of retinoic acid and IL-2) [50].\n\nThe described pathways could potentially also link together. PGE2 can increase the expression of IDO in dendritic cells [52]. Similarly, signalling pathways downstream of PGE2 ligands EP2–4 involve cAMP, which is derived from ATP [21], potentially linking the suppressive actions of COX1 inhibition and A2AR inhibition. However, these potential interactions are very poorly studied and understood and require extensive further study.\n\nSuppression of T-cell proliferation within secondary lymphoid organs seems paradoxical, but these and other results [5–7] show it is conserved in mice and humans, despite utilising different mechanisms. Mouse studies clearly show that it operates in vivo, in isolated FRCs in response to inflammation [5]. Here, we show that it operates in vitro using human cells and in situ in human tissues and that FRCs also secrete key suppressive factors in the absence of current inflammation. One hypothesis is that this mechanism helps prevent bystander damage to stromal cells in a lymph node teeming with inflammatory cytokines and antigen [1,12], and the mechanisms described all have well-charted effects in the resolution of inflammation [39]. Accordingly, viral infection of FRCs is associated with viral persistence in mice [12], and a loose association has been observed in humans and rhesus macaques in studies of HIV and Ebola virus, though studies are correlative [1].\n\nWhile human FRCs did not affect the secretion of effector cytokines from activated cells, they did impose effects on the proliferation of activated cells. FRCs added to pre-activated, rapidly dividing cultures halted their division, and when activated, suppressed T cells are removed from the suppressive influence of FRCs, they begin rapidly dividing within 24 h, despite being washed thoroughly to remove the inflammatory cytokine milieu, and without being given a new activating stimulus. Thus, the effects of FRCs are not limited to naïve T cells.\n\nThis raises the possibility of pharmacologically targeting FRCs as a means to promote a stronger immune response. It would be valuable to study whether FRC inhibition could benefit patient groups who do not mount a robust response to vaccination, or to boost responses to cancer vaccines.\n\nThe in situ activation assay revealed a clear disconnect between the study of human immunology in vitro, in which T cells are frequently activated in isolation, and in situ, in the presence of the microenvironment. Our work highlights the importance of considering the microenvironment for in vitro human immunology studies. Conditions that robustly activated T cells in culture were entirely insufficient to activate T cells in situ. Addition of the inhibitor cocktail significantly increased T cell activation in situ but not to in vitro levels, suggesting the presence of additional physical or chemical inhibitory factors that warrant further study. Similarly, in mice, rare FRCs were observed up-regulating the suppression-mediating nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) enzyme during an in vivo T-cell immune response [5], which was sufficient to robustly impair T-cell activation. These processes are clearly observable yet subject to kinetics and fate decisions we have yet to fully understand—suppressive yet finely tuned to permit T-cell activation and foster immunity.\n\nThe in situ activation assay has potential to test drugs in development for their effects on T-cell activation and proliferation. A technical challenge, requiring further study, is the ability to isolate slices from equivalent areas of tissue. The proportion of naïve T cells within a single donor varied hugely from slice to slice. As such, it was not yet possible to use this method to assess differences in subtler immunophenotypic changes, such as differentiation status. Another important caveat is our lack of transcriptomic data from freshly isolated human FRCs. Cultured FRCs in this study lacked a PDPN-low/negative subset that was present in freshly isolated tonsil FRCs, and the function of this subset in humans is not yet known.\n\nTogether, this work suggests that FRCs utilise druggable targets (individually or in combinations) with the potential to boost the generation of new immune responses within secondary lymphoid organs—for example, following vaccination of relevant patient groups or for the treatment or prevention of malignancy.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement\n\nAll tissues were obtained from consenting donors from the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) resource centre or Human Biomaterials Resource Centre (HBRC), Birmingham (HTA licence 12358, 15/NW/0079), under project approval number REC_RG_HBRC_12–071. All tissues were obtained and utilised in accordance with institutional guidelines and according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nHuman tissues\n\nHuman tonsils were obtained from presently healthy children and adults undergoing routine tonsillectomy for a medical history of recurrent infection or obstructive sleep apnoea. Human blood was obtained from healthy adult donors. Human lymph nodes were procured from cadaveric donors, transported intact in DMEM on ice, and processed for flow cytometry or cell culture within 24 h. All tissues were obtained and utilised in accordance with institutional guidelines.\n\nSingle-cell primary cultures\n\nTonsils and lymph nodes were enzymatically digested using a published protocol [13] or grown through explant culture and used at passage 1–3. Briefly, tissues were cut into small pieces and grown in a low volume of complete media with antibiotics (alpha-MEM with 10% FBS, with penicillin, streptomycin, and a mycoplasma elimination reagent) for 24 h to allow adhesion to the tissue culture plate. Following this, tissues were covered with media containing antibiotics and grown for 5 days to permit fibroblasts to emerge. Tissue was then discarded and cells culture-expanded in complete media without antibiotics. Using this method, a monolayer of &gt;99% pure FRCs was achieved within 2 wk. Ten-fold expansion was taken to equal 1 passage. FRCs were defined as CD45−, CD31−, PDPN+. Very rarely, cultures down-regulated expression of PDPN after passage 3; this did not affect their transcriptome or suppressive T-cell interactions (not shown); nonetheless, such cultures were not used experimentally to ensure uniformity.\n\nT-cell activation assay\n\nFRCs (2 × 104) were plated in a 96-well flat-bottom plate in complete media (alpha-MEM, 10% FBS) and allowed to adhere for 4 h. FRCs were always used in experiments prior to passage 3. Mononuclear leukocytes were isolated from whole blood using a density gradient and then counted using a haemocytometer and Trypan Blue viability dye. Where stated, T cells were purified using the Pan T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and at a purity &gt;90%, or CD25 depleted (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and at a purity &gt;90%. Mononuclear leukocytes or T cells (5 × 105) were added, together with a stimulant: either CD2/3/28 T-cell activation beads (2 beads/T cell) (Miltenyi Biotec) or PHA-L (1 μg/ml) + rhIL-2 (100 U), as stated in figure legends. Inhibitors were added at the following concentrations: SB431542 10 μM (TGFβ signalling pathway inhibitor through blockade of ALK5, 7, 4, Sigma), Indomethacin 5 μM (Cox1/2 and PGE2 synthesis inhibitor, Sigma), SCH 58261 10 μM (A2AR inhibitor, Sigma), 1-methyl-D-Tryptophan (1-MT) 1 mM (Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor, Sigma). SCH 58261 and SB431542 10 μM were stored in DMSO. PGE2 inhibitor was reconstituted in ethanol; 1-MT was reconstituted in methanol and pH adjusted to 7.0. The final volume per well was 200 μl, and all cells and inhibitors were resuspended in complete media without antibiotics. All 4 inhibitors used together at stated concentrations are referred to as the ‘inhibitor cocktail’.\n\nCAR T-cell activation assay\n\nFRCs (1–2 × 104) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO; 5 × 104–1.25 × 105) cells were plated in a 96-well flat-bottom plate in complete media (DMEM, 10% FBS with IL-2 [25 IU/ml]) and allowed to adhere for 4 h. CRT-3 (1 × 105) or mock-transduced T cells were added and incubated for 18 h at 37°C/5% CO2. Culture supernatants were collected at 18 h, and the levels of IFNγ were titrated in culture supernatants using the ELISA method. Briefly, plates (Nunc) were coated with anti-human IFNγ Ab diluted in coating buffer (0.75 μg/ml) and incubated at 4°C overnight. After blocking the wells using buffer containing PBS plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), supernatants were added to each well. Biotin-labelled mAb in incubation buffer was added to each well, and streptavidin-HRP was used as enzyme. The reaction was developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate and stopped by adding 1 M hydrochloric acid. The plates were washed after each step using PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Reading was performed using a microplate automatic reader (Biorad) at a wavelength of 450 nm.\n\nIn situ T-cell activation\n\nTonsils &lt;2 h from surgery were sliced into multiple 0.4–0.6 mm sections using a sterilised carbon-fibre microtome blade or embedded in low-melting-point agarose and sectioned using a vibratome, collected into ice-cold PBS. Sections were randomised between groups and cultured in complete media containing PHA-L (1 μg/ml) + rhIL-2 (100 U), with or without the inhibitor cocktail described above. Multiple slices were used per treatment group. After 96 h, each slice was pushed through a cell strainer to create a single-cell suspension and stained for flow cytometry or embedded in OCT buffer and snap-frozen for sectioning and imaging. To minimise differences arising from sectioning different areas of tissue, data from multiple slices were averaged to obtain a single data point per donor.\n\nFlow cytometry\n\nCells were harvested at stated time points and stained for 20 min in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA) using antibodies as described in S1 Table. Cells were fixed and permeabilised using a commercial kit (BD) and then stained for intracellular proteins using the following antibodies: cells were resuspended for flow cytometry, filtered through 100 μm mesh, and acquired using flow cytometry. Analysis utilised commercial analysis software (TreeStar or DeNovo Software). tSNE analysis was performed using 1,000 iterations, with perplexity 30 and theta 0.5, displaying a proportional number of events.\n\nImaging\n\nHuman tonsils were embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Sakura) and then flash frozen using dry ice. Then, 10–12 mm transverse sections were generated on a cryostat (Bright Instrument Company) and collected on adhesive slides (Leica). Sections were air-dried for 2 h at room temperature (RT) and then fixed in cold acetone for 25 min. Sections were air-dried overnight for immediate immunolabelling or stored at −80°C until further use. Frozen tonsil sections were air-dried for 15 min at RT and rehydrated for 5 min with 1X PBS. Sections were then permeabilised for 15 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and washed 3 times with 1X PBS. Sections were blocked for 1 h in 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% goat serum in PBS in a humidified chamber. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA. After incubation, sections were washed 3 times with 1X PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Secondary antibodies included goat anti-rat Alexa 546 (ThermoFisher), goat anti-rat Alexa 546 (ThermoFisher), goat anti-rat goat Alexa 647 (ThermoFisher), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (ThermoFisher), donkey anti-mouse DyLight 594 (ThermoFisher), and donkey anti-goat Alexa 555 (ThermoFisher). Sections were then incubated with DAPI for 1 min, followed by 3 additional washes with 1X PBS. Negative controls utilised incubation with PBS with relevant serum or relevant isotype, followed by secondary antibody. Finally, sections were mounted in antifade mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific) for imaging. Immunofluorescence images were taken with a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 880, using ZEN Pro imaging system.\n\nRNA-Seq\n\nTonsil-derived FRCs from 3 donors (in-house) and bone marrow–derived MSCs from 3 donors (Lonza and expanded in-house) were grown in culture to P3 in the presence of hFGF (4 μg/ml) and harvested in logarithmic growth phase. Total RNA was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and purified using a cleanup kit (Qiagen). Samples were quality tested using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and the Agilent RNA 6000 nano kit. RIN numbers for all samples ranged from 9.5 to 10. Samples were then sent to BGI (Hong Kong) for library preparation and sequencing. Briefly, library preparation utilised poly-A enrichment followed by Ribozero depletion. Samples were run in a high-performance sequencing machine (Illumina) over 2 lanes, resulting in approximately 60 million reads per sample. Data were then trimmed for adapter sequences before analysis. Bioinformatics alignment and further analysis was done in-house using commercial software (Partek). For a visual representation of gene expression, TPM was used for normalisation. The heatmap was made using Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). Data are accessible at monash.figshare.com doi: 10.4225/03/5a2dae0c9b455.\n\nStatistics\n\nData were tested for normality using D’Agostino and Pearson normality test. Normally distributed data of 2 groups were compared using an unpaired t test, or of 3 or more groups using an ANOVA with a multiple comparison test, as described in figure legends. When data were not normally distributed, 2 comparisons were made using a Mann-Whitney test. When fold-change data were compared to a normalised value of 1, a 2-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. P &lt; 0.05 was taken as significant.\n\nSupporting information"
