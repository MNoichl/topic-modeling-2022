  "fullText": "In PLoS Biology, volume 3, issue 6: DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030160\n\nThe following statement in the last paragraph of the Results contains a factual error: “A total of 34% of cortical thymocytes expressing the P14 TCR had motility rates greater than 13 μm/min compared to approximately 2% for wild-type thymocytes expressing diverse TCRs.” The sentence should read as follows: “A total of 20% of cortical thymocytes expressing the P14 TCR had motility rates greater than 13 μm/min compared to approximately 2% for wild-type thymocytes expressing diverse TCRs.”\n\nThe authors apologize for any confusion this error may have caused."
