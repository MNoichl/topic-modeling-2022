  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nRNA in all cellular organisms is synthesized by a complex molecular machine, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). In bacteria, the catalytically competent core RNAP (subunit composition α2ββ'ω) has a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa. Evolutionary relationships for each of the bacterial core subunits have been identified between all organisms from bacteria to man [1]–[3]. These relationships are particularly strong between the two largest subunits, β' and β, which contain colinearly arranged segments of conserved sequence (Figure 1) [3]. These conserved segments are separated by relatively nonconserved spacer regions in which large, lineage-specific gaps or insertions can occur [3],[4]. The functional significance of these lineage-specific differences is poorly understood due to a lack of correlated biochemical and structural information. The bulk of our biochemical and genetic knowledge on bacterial RNAP comes from studies of Escherichia coli (Eco) RNAP but all of our high-resolution structural information comes form Thermus RNAPs [5]–[8] as Eco RNAP has not been amenable to X-ray crystallography analysis. The Eco and Thermus β and β' subunits harbor large sequence insertions (&gt;40 amino acids) that are not present in the other species and are not shared across bacterial species (Figure 1) [3]. For example, the Eco β' subunit contains β'-insert-6 (or β'i6, using the lineage-specific insert nomenclature of Lane et al. [3]), a 188-residue insertion in the middle of the highly conserved “trigger loop.” On the other hand, the Thermus β' subunit lacks β'i6 but contains β'i2 (283 residues). High-resolution structures of both of these lineage-specific inserts reveal that they comprise repeats of a previously characterized fold, the sandwich-barrel hybrid motif (SBHM) [9],[10]. Similarly, the Eco β subunit harbors three large insertions missing in Thermus, βi4 (119 residues), βi9 (99 residues), and βi11 (54 residues), whereas the Thermus β subunit harbors βi12 (43 residues).\n\nIn some respects, the high-resolution Thermus RNAP structures have served as good models to interpret the functional literature obtained from biochemical, biophysical, and genetic studies of Eco RNAP [11],[12]. Nevertheless, a complete molecular model of Eco core RNAP has not been available due to the absence of high-resolution structural information on the Eco β subunit lineage-specific inserts. The most detailed structural studies of Eco RNAP have come from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of helical crystals at about 15 Å-resolution [13]. This cryo-EM reconstruction of Eco core RNAP could be interpreted in detail by fitting the Taq core RNAP X-ray structure, revealing a large distortion of the structure (opening of the active site channel by more than 20 Å) due to intermolecular contacts in the helical crystals. Strong electron density for Eco βi9 was present in the cryo-EM reconstruction, but weak density for Eco βi4 and Eco β'i6 indicated these domains were flexible in the context of the helical crystals [13]. Most previous EM reconstructions of various forms of Eco RNAP have not revealed information concerning the lineage-specific inserts (for instance, see [14]). A recent 20 Å-resolution, negative-stain EM reconstruction of an activator-dependent transcription initiation complex containing Eco RNAP [15] allowed the positioning of the Eco β'i6 crystal structure [10], but the lack of structural information on the other Eco lineage-specific inserts prevented the detailed interpretation of additional densities present in the reconstruction [15].\n\nIn this study, we used a combination of structural approaches to generate a complete molecular model of Eco core RNAP. We determined two new high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of Eco RNAP β subunit fragments that include Eco βi4 and βi9 and used an ab initio method to predict the structure of the small Eco βi11 [16]. The three available X-ray crystal structures of Eco RNAP fragments (the two structures determined herein and the structure of Eco β'i6 [10]) and the predicted structure of Eco βi11 were incorporated into a homology model of Eco core RNAP. Finally, we used cryo-EM imaging combined with single-particle image analysis to obtain a low-resolution structure of the solution conformation of Eco core RNAP in which densities corresponding to lineage-specific insertions could be clearly identified. Flexible-fitting of the Eco RNAP homology model into cryo-EM densities generated a complete molecular model of Eco core RNAP and an Eco RNAP ternary elongation complex (TEC).\n\nResults\n\nCrystal Structure of Eco RNAP β2-βi4\n\nThe lineage-specific insert βi4 (previously named β dispensable region 1, or βDR1, or SI1 in the literature [13],[17],[18]), located between bacterial shared regions βb6 and βb7 (using the bacterial RNAP common region nomenclature of Lane et al. [3]) in the β2 domain (Figure 1) [5],[19], was predicted to comprise from one to six tandem repeats of a structural motif termed the β-β' module 2 (BBM2) [4]. The βi4 of Acidobacteria, Mollicutes, and Proteobacteria (including Eco) was predicted to comprise two tandem BBM2 repeats [3]. Eco βi4 comprises β residues 225–343 (Figure 2A).\n\nWe prepared a construct comprising the Eco β2 domain including βi4 inserted within it (Eco β residues 152–443, hereafter called Eco β2-βi4). After reductive methylation [20], the protein formed crystals that diffracted X-rays to 1.6 Å-resolution (Table 1). The structure was solved by single-anomalous dispersion using a dataset collected from crystals of selenomethionyl-substituted protein [21] and refined to an R/Rfree of 0.209/0.229 at 1.6 Å-resolution (Table 1, Figures 2, S1).\n\nAs expected, the Eco β2 (Eco β residues 151–224 and 344–445) and the Thermus β2 (Taq or Tth β residues 138–325) domains have similar overall structures (Figure S2). A superimposition of the two domains over 100 residues (excluding flexible loops connecting secondary structural elements) yields a root-mean-square deviation in α-carbon positions of 1.68 Å. Significant differences in the structures include: (i) the loop connecting the first two β-strands of the β2 domain, where Eco has a 5-residue insertion (Eco β residues 164–168, disordered in our structure), and (ii) the loop connecting the last two α-helices of the β2 domain, which includes a 7-residue insertion present in Taq β (Taq β residues 293–299; Figures 2A, S2).\n\nThe βi4 domain is inserted at the surface of the β2 domain distal to the connection with the RNAP (Figure 2B). A 3-residue segment of Taq β (Taq β 212–214) is replaced by the 119-residue Eco βi4 (Figure 2A). The Eco βi4 folds into a compact, cylinder-shaped domain about 22 Å in diameter and about 50 Å in length (Figures 2B, 2C). The compact domain is connected to the β2 domain by two short connector loops (Eco β 225–226 and 337–345). The βi4 domain packs against β2, resulting in the burial of a modest 618 Å2 of surface area. As predicted [4], the Eco βi4 includes two tandem BBM2 motifs (Figure 2A, 2C).\n\nCrystal Structure of Eco RNAP βflap-βi9\n\nThe lineage-specific insert βi9 (previously named β dispensable region 2, or βDR2, or SI2 in the literature [13],[18],[22],[23]) is located between bacterial shared regions βb13 and βb14 [3] at the base of the flap domain (Figure 1) [5],[19]. The βi9 is found in Acidobacteria, Aquificae, Bacteriodetes, Chlamydiae, Chlorobi, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria (including Eco), and Nitrospirae [3]. Eco βi9 comprises β residues 938–1042 (Figure 3A).\n\nA construct comprising the Eco flap domain (Eco β 831–1057), including βi9, was crystallized as a complex with bacteriophage T4 gp33 (K.-A.F.T., P. Deighan, S. Nechaev, A. Hochschild, E.P. Geiduschek, S.A.D., in preparation). The structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement (using the Taq flap domain as a search model) and single-anomalous dispersion using data collected from selenomethionyl-substituted protein (Table S1, Figure S3) [21]. The complete structure was refined to an R/Rfree of 0.264/0.291 at 3.0 Å-resolution. T4 gp33 interacts primarily with the flap-tip and does not make any interactions with βi9. These and further details of the complex with T4 gp33 will be described elsewhere (K.-A.F.T., P. Deighan, S. Nechaev, A. Hochschild, E.P. Geiduschek, S.A.D., in preparation).\n\nThe βi9 domain is inserted at the base of the flap domain, near the C-terminal connection of the flap with the rest of the RNAP and distal to the flap-tip (Figure 3B). A 6-residue segment of Taq β (Taq β 809–814) is replaced by the 105-residue Eco βi9 (Figure 3A). The Eco βi9 comprises two long, parallel α-helices of 38 and 32 residues (Eco β 943–980 and 1006–1037, respectively) with a short, hook-like connecting segment (residues 981–1005) at the end distal to the flap (Figure 3B), forming an apparently rigid structure reminiscent of a hook-and-ladder that extends nearly 65 Å out from the flap domain. The βi9 is connected to the flap domain by two connector loops (Eco β 938–942 and 1038–142) but makes minimal interactions with the flap itself. The structure does not appear to conform to the β-β' module 1 motif (BBM1, similar to the BBM2 motif, Figure 2C) predicted for βi9 [4]. The 105-residue Eco βi9 is at the lower end of the size range for βi9 sequences, which ranges from 105 residues in some Proteobacteria to 143 residues in some Bacteriodetes. An alignment of 307 non-redundant βi9 sequences (see Dataset S1) reveals that the two long, ladder α-helices do not harbor insertions; all of the insertions occur in the hook-like connector at the distal end of βi9 (Figure 3A). Therefore, we conclude that βi9 has a conserved core structure with the two ladder α-helices of conserved length.\n\nCryo-EM Reconstruction of Eco RNAP\n\nWe generated a single-particle cryo-EM (spEM) reconstruction of Eco RNAP by analyzing ∼42,000 images of Eco RNAP particles preserved in vitreous ice (Figures 4A, S4–S6). Initial image orientation parameters were determined using a 35 Å-resolution RNAP model based on the Taq core RNAP X-ray structure [5]. Final refinement of image orientation parameters by projection matching yielded a structure of Eco RNAP with a 0.5 Fourier-shell cutoff resolution of ∼11.2 Å (Figure S4). Nevertheless, information beyond about 14 Å resolution was very weak, and so the figures and analysis described herein were performed on a low-pass Fourier-filtered map [24],[25]. Although the cryo-EM grids were prepared with samples of Eco RNAP holoenzyme (core RNAP plus the promoter-specificity σ70 subunit), the σ70 subunit apparently dissociated during grid preparation as density corresponding to σ70 was completely absent. Dissociation during cryo-EM sample preparation has been noted for other macromolecular complexes [26] and is also consistent with reports of dissociation constants for the σ70/core RNAP complex as high as 200–300 nM (the RNAP concentration used here was about 200 nM). The spEM reconstruction showed Eco core RNAP in a conformation similar to that observed in Thermus X-ray structures but with clear density corresponding to βi4, βi11, and β'i6 (Figures 4A, S5, S6).\n\nMolecular Model of the Complete Eco Core RNAP\n\nIn order to interpret the spEM map of Eco core RNAP, we generated a homology model of Eco core RNAP using the core component of the T. thermophilus (Tth) RNAP holoenzyme structure (PDB ID 1IW7) [7] as a template. The locations of the Eco lineage-specific insertions βi4, βi9, βi11, and β'i6 (absent in Thermus) were left as gaps in the Eco sequences. Thermus-specific inserts βi12 and β'i2 (Figure 1) were also removed from the structural template. The crystal structures of Eco β2-βi4 (Figure 2B) and βflap-βi9 (Figure 3B) were spliced into the resulting homology model by superimposition of the overlapping β2 and βflap domains, respectively. At this stage, the Eco RNAP model was readily fit manually into the spEM map. The spEM map contained clear density corresponding to βi4, but density for βi9 was absent. Density for the ω subunit as well as the C-terminal helix of β' were also absent. In addition, extra density not accounted for by the homology model was present for βi11 and β'i6. An ab initio predicted structure of the short βi11 (see below) was placed into the corresponding density to fill in the gap in the Eco β sequence between 1121 and 1181. The crystal structure of Eco β'i6 (PDB ID 2AUK) [10] was readily fit manually into excess density in the vicinity of its insertion point in β'. Two criteria were used to determine the orientation of β'i6 with respect to the rest of the RNAP. First, although β'i6 comprises a tandem repeat of two SBHM domains, the C-terminal SBHM domain (SBHMb) [10] harbors larger insertions between the core SBHM β-strands, making β'i6 asymmetric in shape. The asymmetry is clearly seen in the spEM density as well (see Figure 4A, top view). Moreover, only one orientation of β'i6 allows connection to the gap in the Eco β' sequence (between residues 940 and 1132) without severe distortion. The positioned β'i6 was readily connected to the open (unfolded) trigger-loop (TL) conformation of the model.\n\nFlexible-fitting of the final Eco RNAP model (excluding ω, the C-terminal 41 residues of β', and βi9) into the spEM map was performed using YUP.SCX [27], resulting in a superb fit of the conserved RNAP as well as of the lineage-specific inserts (excluding βi9; Figures 4A, S5, S6). In order to position βi9 in the context of the entire RNAP structure, we used our previously determined helical cryo-EM map of Eco core RNAP (hEM) and fit of the Taq core RNAP X-ray crystal structure [13] since the hEM map contains strong density for βi9. The βflap portion (excluding the flexible flap-tip) of the Eco βflap-βi9 crystal structure (Figure 3B) was superimposed on the Taq βflap domain in the context of the Taq RNAP fit into the hEM density. The resulting position of βi9 did not correspond to the hEM density (light orange, βi9 in Figure 4B) but was fit into the density by a rotation of about 35° (orange, βi9' in Figure 4B). This positioning of βi9 is consistent with the location of positive difference density observed in the context of the helical crystals due to a 234-residue insertion between Eco β residues 998 and 999 (red dot, Figure 4B). The Eco core RNAP model was completed by adding back the C-terminal segment of β' as well as ω (in accordance with the Thermus RNAP structures).\n\nThe Eco core RNAP model was then used as the basis for generating a homology model of an Eco TEC, using the Tth TEC crystal structure (open TL conformation, PDB ID 2O5I) [8]. For both models, the lineage-specific inserts (βi4, βi9, βi11, β'i6 for Eco; β'i2 and β'i12 for Tth) were removed. The nucleic acids present in the Tth crystal structure were fixed during the modeling. The Eco lineage-specific inserts were added back to the resulting TEC model (according to their positions in the Eco core RNAP model), and missing portions of the nucleic acids (the upstream double-stranded DNA, and the nontemplate strand of the DNA within the transcription bubble) were modeled according to Korzheva et al. [28].\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this work, two new X-ray crystal structures (Eco β2-βi4, Figure 2; Eco βflap-βi9, Figure 3) and an ab initio predicted structure (Eco βi11, see below), combined with a previously determined X-ray crystal structure of Eco β'i6 [10], provide high-resolution structural descriptions of each of the lineage-specific sequence insertions found in the highly biochemically and genetically characterized Eco RNAP [3]. In addition, a new 15 Å-resolution cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction of Eco RNAP (Figures 4A, S4–S6) reveals clear electron density for βi4, βi11, and β'i6, while a previously determined cryo-EM reconstruction of Eco core RNAP from helical crystals contains strong electron density for βi9 [13],[23]. The combination of these structural data provides the basis for a detailed and complete atomic model of Eco RNAP and an Eco core RNAP TEC.\n\nThe large β and β' subunits comprise regions of sequence shared among all bacterial RNAPs [3]. These shared regions, which make up 63% of the Eco β and 67% of the Eco β' sequence, are expected to have nearly identical structure among all bacterial RNAPs. The α subunits are also highly homologous [5],[29]. Thus, most of the Eco RNAP structure is expected to be highly similar, if not identical, to the Thermus RNAP structures. The unique contribution of this work is the high-resolution structural information on the Eco lineage-specific inserts βi4, βi9, and βi11, as well as the detailed structural model of all the lineage-specific inserts in the context of the entire RNAP and a TEC. The following discussion therefore focuses on the Eco lineage-specific inserts and insights into their role in RNAP function provided by our new structural information.\n\nβi4\n\nRNAPs harboring deletions or insertions within βi4 support cell growth and retain basic in vitro transcription function, leading to its designation as “dispensable region I” of the β subunit [17]. Nevertheless, careful studies of a nearly precise βi4 deletion (deletion of Eco β 226–350) revealed defects [18]. The purified Δβi4-RNAP showed only very mild defects, or no defects at all, in a number of in vitro tests [17],[18]. In vivo, however, the Δβi4-RNAP was unable to support cell growth at 42°C and could only support slow growth at 30°C.\n\nIn our model of the Eco TEC, βi4 extends out from the β2 domain roughly in the direction of the downstream double-stranded DNA (Figure 5). However, βi4 is unlikely to interact directly with the downstream DNA to form part of an extended DNA binding channel since βi4 tilts away from the DNA, creating a roughly 15 Å gap between itself and the DNA. Moreover, the solvent-exposed surface of βi4, including the entire surface facing the DNA, is highly acidic (Figure 5, front view), except for a “neutral patch” that arises from three conserved residues, Eco β R268, R272, and R275 (Figure 5, top view). These positions are conserved as basic residues (either R or K) in 98%, 91%, and 91% of the sequences, respectively, in an alignment of 316 non-redundant βi4 sequences (containing only “Eco-like” βi4 sequences comprising two BBM2 domains; see Dataset S2) and may comprise an interaction determinant for an as yet unidentified regulatory factor.\n\nThe bacteriophage T4 Alc protein interacts with the host Eco RNAP [30] and causes premature transcription termination on Eco DNA while allowing Eco RNAP-mediated transcription of phage DNA containing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine [31]. Eco paf mutants (prevent Alc function) have been mapped to the rpoB gene encoding the RNAP β subunit [17],[32]. Eco β mutants R368H, R368C, and a double mutant (P345S/P372L) display the paf phenotype, possibly by directly preventing Alc interaction with RNAP [17]. These mutations lie within a region of the β subunit that could be deleted without disrupting basic transcription function [17] but are not, in fact, contained within βi4 (Figure 2A). Two of the mutated positions (368 and 372) lie within βb7, a region shared among all bacterial RNAPs (Figure 2A) [3]. In our structural model of the Eco RNAP TEC, βR368 and βP372 lie within a structural feature that sits at the entrance of the main RNAP active site channel, inside the “V” formed by the upstream and downstream DNA of the TEC (Figure 5, channel and front views). These residues are not near any nucleic acids in the TEC (the closest approach is for the backbone carbonyl of βP372, which is 15 Å away from the nontemplate DNA phosphate backbone at the -10 position) but could comprise part of an Alc binding determinant on the RNAP [17]. The 19 kDa Alc protein bound in this vicinity (Figure 5, channel and front views) would be well positioned to distinguish the presence of cytosine or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in either the downstream double-stranded DNA (where the 5-hydroxymethyl moiety would be exposed in the major groove) or the single-stranded non-template DNA in the transcription bubble.\n\nβi9\n\nRNAPs harboring deletions or insertions within βi9 support cell growth and retain in vitro transcription function, leading to its designation as “dispensable region II” of the β subunit [17],[22],[23],[33]. Nevertheless, careful studies of a precise βi9 deletion (deletion of Eco β 938–1040) revealed defects [18]. The purified Δβi9-RNAP showed only very mild defects, or no defects at all, in a number of in vitro tests [18]. The βi9 contains the epitope for the PYN-6 monoclonal antibody and, consistent with in vitro tests showing little effect of deleting βi9 on normal RNAP function, RNAP can be immobilized using the PYN-6 antibody but remains active for in vitro transcription [22]. In vivo, however, the Δβi9-RNAP was unable to support cell growth in minimal media [18].\n\nOur crystal structure of the Eco βflap-βi9 suggests that βi9 is attached to the flap via flexible linkers and does not make a significant, stable interaction with the flap (Figure 3B), suggesting that βi9 is highly flexible in its orientation with respect to the flap. Indeed, the position of βi9 in the βflap-βi9 crystal structure appears to be determined by packing interactions with neighboring, symmetry-related molecules. In keeping with this, there is no density for βi9 in the spEM reconstruction (Figures 4A, S5, S6). However, in our previous hEM reconstruction of Eco RNAP, strong density consistent with βi9 was observed, and this density was shown to correspond to βi9 through a helical reconstruction of a mutant RNAP harboring a large insertion between positions 998 and 999 [23]. In the helical crystals, the packing of a neighboring, symmetry-related RNAP molecule restricts the range of positions available to βi9, allowing its visualization (Figure 4B). Fitting βi9 into the corresponding density in the hEM reconstruction required a large change in the position of βi9 with respect to the flap, but the final model fits very well into the density and is also consistent with the EM localization results [23], which were not used as a constraint in the fitting (Figure 4B). This model for the position of βi9 in the context of the entire RNAP is presented as an example of a particular orientation that is possible for βi9 (since it was observed in the helical crystals), but the evidence indicates that βi9 does not adopt a particular conformation with respect to the RNAP but can access a wide range of positions (Figure 6).\n\nThe modeled position of βi9 is not near any nucleic acids in the TEC or in the open promoter complex [34]. Moreover, the solvent-exposed surface of βi9 is primarily acidic (Figure S7). Interestingly, an alignment of 307 non-redundant βi9 sequences (see Dataset S1) reveals that conserved, solvent-exposed residues are all displayed on the back face of the “ladder,” opposite the “hook” (Figure S7). Conserved features of this face comprise charged residues D959 (conserved as D or E in 97% of the sequences), E962 (D/E, 95%), R974 (K/R, 89%), K1032 (K/R, 95%), and K1035 (K/R, 94%), and one conserved hydrophobic residue, I966. These features suggest that this face of the ladder may serve as an interaction determinant for as yet unidentified regulatory factors. D959 and K1032 participate in an apparently conserved salt bridge. Predictably, a number of conserved hydrophobic residues participate in the hydrophobic core of the domain, either between the ladder and the hook (L979, L989) or in the packing interface between the two ladder helices (L1029, I1036).\n\nβi11\n\nThe lineage-specific insert βi11 is located between bacterial shared regions βb14 and βb15 (Figures 1, 7A) [3]. The βi11 is found in Acidobacteriaceae, Aquificae, and Proteobacteria (including Eco) [3]. In each bacterial species where it is found, βi11 has a length ranging from 54–69 residues. Comparing Taq with Eco, a 5-residue segment of Taq β (Taq β 895–899) is replaced by the 59-residue Eco βi11, comprising Eco β residues 1122–1180 (Figure 7A).\n\nAlthough a construct corresponding to Eco RNAP βi11 overexpressed and was well behaved, we were unable to obtain crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. The Robetta server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/) provided an ab initio predicted structure of this short, 59-residue fragment (Figure S8) that is consistent with a number of observations from our structural and sequence analyses:\n\nThe overall predicted structure of βi11 fits well into the corresponding spEM density (Figure 7B, right).\n\nThe termini of the predicted βi11 structure could be readily connected to the corresponding gap in the Eco RNAP β structure with only minor modifications.\n\nIn an alignment of 310 non-redundant βi11 sequences (see Dataset S3), insertions and gaps occur in locations consistent with the predicted structure (i.e. in loops connecting secondary structural elements and away from the RNAP; Figure S8).\n\nAnalysis of the βi11 sequence alignment reveals that most of the conserved residues are hydrophobic in nature and are buried in the hydrophobic core of the βi11 fold (Figure S8C). Two conserved, solvent-accessible polar residues (R1142 and D1166) form an apparently conserved salt-bridge that may stabilize the structure (Figure S8C).\n\nThe βi11 was only recently recognized as a distinct, lineage-specific insertion [3],[4]. To our knowledge, no information on the effects of deletions or mutations in this region is available. Inspection of the spEM map and the aligned X-ray structure of Taq core RNAP in the region of the β subunit between shared regions βb14 and βb16 revealed a clear discrepancy that corresponds to Taq βi12 (Figure 7B). In our Eco RNAP model, the Taq βi12 was removed and the resulting gap was connected by the loop corresponding to Eco β residues 1200–1207. The predicted structure of Eco βi11 (Figure S8) was then spliced between Eco β residues 1121 and 1181 and oriented to fit into the EM density, resulting in a good fit. The resulting location of Eco βi11 clashed with the position of the β-subunit N-terminus, which was redirected to relieve the clash (Figure 7B).\n\nβ'i6\n\nWhile the large Eco lineage-specific insertions βi4 and βi9 appear to play only peripheral roles in RNAP function, and the complete deletion of either one results in relatively minor growth defects [18], β'i6 plays a more important role in Eco RNAP function. Complete deletion, or even partial deletion, of β'i6 is not viable [18],[35]. Complete deletion causes a severe defect in RNAP assembly, both in vivo and in vitro [18],[35], but the in vivo–assembled Δβ'i6-RNAP can be obtained from cells simultaneously overexpressing the other RNAP subunits [18], and partial deletions of β'i6 can be assembled in vitro [35]. Biochemical studies of enzymes with complete or partial β'i6 deletions reveal a number of severe defects. The Δβ'i6-RNAP forms dramatically destabilized open promoter complexes [18]. RNAPs harboring partial deletions in β'i6 are defective in transcript cleavage and have a dramatically reduced transcript elongation rate at subsaturating NTP concentrations [35]. Antibody binding to epitopes within β'i6 inhibit transcription as well as intrinsic transcript cleavage [35],[36].\n\nThe β'i6 plays a central role in the pausing/termination behavior of elongating Eco RNAP [18],[35]. Full or partial deletions in β'i6 result in RNAPs with dramatically altered pausing behavior [18],[35]. A genetic screen for termination-altering mutants in Eco RNAP uncovered 10 positions scattered throughout β'i6 [37].\n\nThese profound effects of β'i6 on Eco RNAP function are likely due to its insertion in the middle of a critical and highly conserved structural feature of the RNAP, the so-called “trigger-loop” (TL), which connects two highly conserved α-helices (TL-helices 1 and 2, TLH1 and TLH2; Figures 1, 8). The TLHs, in turn, interact with another central structural element, the bridge-helix (BH; Figure 8B). The TL tends to be unstructured (open) in RNAP and in the substrate-free TEC but is found in a structured conformation (closed) where it makes many direct contacts with the incoming NTP substrate in the TEC [38],[39]. The TL has been proposed to cycle between open and closed conformations at each nucleotide addition step to promote rNTP substrate recognition, enzyme fidelity, and possibly catalysis [38]–[42].\n\nMicrocin J25 (MccJ25) is a bactericidal 21-residue peptide that inhibits transcription by binding bacterial RNAP within the secondary channel [43]–[46]. Based on saturation mutagenesis of Eco rpoC (the gene encoding the RNAP β' subunit), MccJ25 does not contact β'i6; most amino acid substitutions that yield strong resistance against MccJ25 lie in the BH and the TL [43],[44],[46]. Nevertheless, a deletion of β'i6 perturbs the effects of MccJ25 [46], likely through the effects of the β'i6 deletion on the TL conformation.\n\nOur positioning of β'i6 in the spEM density (Figures 4, S5, S6) and its connections with the open TL conformation (Figure 8B) are similar to the results of Hudson et al. [15]. The β'i6 sits outside the RNAP active site channel and makes extensive interactions with the β'-jaw (Figure 8B). The N-terminal SBHM domain of β'i6 (SBHMa) faces the secondary channel, consistent with the results of crosslinks mapped from backtracked TECs (in which the 3′-end of the RNA transcript is extruded out the secondary channel) between analogs incorporated into the RNA 3′-end and the N-terminal region of β'i6 [28]. SBHMb faces the downstream double-stranded DNA-binding channel (Figures 5, 8) but does not contact the DNA; the closest approach between the DNA and β'i6 is 16 Å (between β'D1073 and the nontemplate strand backbone phosphate at +14). Moreover, β'i6 is highly acidic over its entire solvent-exposed surface, including the region facing the downstream double-stranded DNA (Figure 5, front view).\n\nAlthough β'i6 connects readily to the open conformation of the TL via extended linkers (Figure 8B), modeling suggests it would not be able to connect with the closed TL conformation in the modeled position, a conclusion also reached by Hudson et al. [15]. Since the folding of the TL is required for interactions between highly conserved TL-residues and the incoming nucleotide substrate [19],[38],[39], it is likely that the position of β'i6 must change to accommodate the folded TL conformation at each nucleotide addition step of the transcription cycle.\n\nDuring bacteriophage T7 infection, the Eco RNAP β' subunit is phosphorylated by the phage-encoded kinase Gp0.7 [47], and the site of phosphorylation has been identified as a single amino acid in β'i6, T1068 (Figures 5, 8) [48]. Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect pausing, as well as ρ-dependent termination behavior, of Eco RNAP [48]. This site is in the β'i6 loop that makes the closest approach to the downstream DNA, but as discussed above, this region is nevertheless not in close contact with the DNA. The surface is already overall acidic (Figure 5, front view), so it seems unlikely that phosphorylation at this site affects RNAP function by affecting interactions with the downstream DNA.\n\nConclusions\n\nAn understanding of the basic principles of transcription and its regulation has been garnered largely through detailed study of the transcription system of one organism, Eco, which has served as a model for understanding transcription at the molecular and cellular level for more than four decades. The detailed and comprehensive structural description of Eco core RNAP and an Eco RNAP TEC presented here sheds new light on the interpretation of previous biochemical and genetic data. Moreover, the molecular models provide a structural framework for designing future experiments to investigate the function of the Eco RNAP lineage-specific insertions and their role in the Eco transcription program, allowing a fuller exploitation of Eco as a model transcription system.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCrystallization and Structure Determination of Eco RNAP β2-βi4\n\nEco β2-βi4 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from the Eco rpoB expression plasmid pRL706 [49] and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of a pET28a-based expression plasmid, creating pSKB2(10-His)Ecoβ2-βi4, encoding Eco β2-βi4 with an N-terminal PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) cleavable His10-tag. The pSKB2(10-His)Ecoβ2-βi4 was transformed into Eco BL21 (DE3) cells. After growing transformed cells in LB medium with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) at 37 °C to an A600 nm = 0.6, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% v/v glycerol, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride), lysed in a continuous-flow French press (Avestin), and clarified by centrifugation. The protein was purified by HiTrap Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) and the His10-tag was removed using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The sample was further purified by a second, subtractive HiTrap Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography step to remove uncleaved His10-tagged protein and the His10-tag released from the cleaved product, and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare). The purified protein was concentrated to 17 mg/ml by centrifugal filtration (VivaScience) and exchanged into storage buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT), and stored at –80 °C. Selenomethionyl-substituted protein was prepared by suppression of methionine biosynthesis [50] and purified by using similar procedures. Reductive methylation of lysine residues was performed as described [20].\n\nCrystals were grown at 22°C in sitting drops using vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (0.5 µl at 6 mg/ml in storage buffer) and crystallization solution (0.2 M potassium-sodium tartrate, 20% PEG3350). Crystals (irregular plates) appeared after a few days and grew to a maximum size of about 200×100×50 µm in 1 wk. Crystals were prepared for cryo-crystallography by a quick soak in cryo-solution (0.2 M potassium-sodium tartrate, 35% PEG3350), then flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline X3A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS, Brookhaven, NY) and processed using HKL2000 [51]. Six of seven possible Se sites were located within the asymmetric unit using the anomalous signal from the Se1 dataset (Table 1) using SHELX [52]. Heavy atom refinement, phasing, and density modification calculations were performed with SHARP [53] using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data to 1.9 Å-resolution from the Se1 dataset, as well as the 1.6 Å-resolution Se2 dataset (Table 1), yielding an excellent map that allowed automatic building of almost the entire structure using ARP/wARP [54]. Iterative cycles of refinement and model building were carried out using Coot [55] and RefMac5 [56]. The final model was refined to an R/Rfree of 0.209/229 at 1.6 Å-resolution (Rfree was calculated using 5% random data omitted from the refinement). 97.5% of residues fall in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, while no residues are in disallowed regions.\n\nCrystallization and Structure Determination of Eco RNAP βflap-βi9\n\nThe Eco βflap-βi9 (Eco β residues 831–1057) was co-expressed with bacteriophage T4 gp33 [57] as a single operon from a modified pET29a vector [58] and the complex was purified using standard procedures (K.-A.F.T., P. Deighan, S. Nechaev, A. Hochschild, E.P. Geiduschek, S.A.D., in preparation). Selenomethionyl-substituted complex was produced by suppression of methionine biosynthesis [50].\n\nCrystals of the complex were grown at 22°C in sitting drops using vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (1 µl at 7.5–12 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% v/v glycerol, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM DTT) and crystallization solution (0.2 M tri-potassium citrate, 20% w/v PEG3350). Crystals were prepared for cryo-crystallography by slow exchange into cryo-solution (0.2 M tri-potassium citrate, 20% w/v PEG3350, 20% v/v ethylene glycol), then flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline X3A at the NSLS (Brookhaven, NY) and processed using HKL2000 (Table S1) [51]. A molecular replacement solution was obtained using the Native amplitudes (Table S1) with a search model consisting of a homology model of the Eco βflap based on the Taq βflap generated using MODELLER (the search model excluded the flexible flap-tip) [59]. The molecular replacement phases were used to locate four Se sites from the anomalous signal of the Se dataset (Table S1). Heavy atom refinement, phasing, and density modification calculations were performed with SHARP [53] using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data from the Se dataset (Table S1) yielding an interpretable map (Figure S3). Iterative cycles of refinement and model building were carried out using Coot [55] and RefMac5 [56]. The final model was refined to an R/Rfree of 0.265/0.291 at 3.0 Å-resolution (Rfree was calculated using 5% random data omitted from the refinement). 95.25% of residues fall in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, while no residues are in disallowed regions.\n\nCryo-EM Reconstruction of Eco RNAP by Single-Particle Averaging\n\nPurification of Eco core RNAP from an overexpression system was performed as described [60]. This results in highly pure Eco RNAP core enzyme, which is deficient in the ω subunit. Eco RNAP holoenzyme was prepared by incubating core RNAP (3 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) with a 5-fold molar excess of σ70 for 30 min at room temperature. For cryo-EM, a 5 µl sample (0.1 mg/ml in the same buffer) was applied to a Quantifoil grid coated with holey carbon film previously made hydrophilic by glow-discharge. The grid was blotted with filter paper and then immediately plunged into liquid ethane slush. The sample was imaged at 50,000× magnification with a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Micrographs displaying minimal astigmatism were digitized at a 14 µm interval (corresponding to 2.8 Å on the image) using a Zeiss SCAI flat-bed densitometer (ZI/Carl Zeiss). Individual particles were selected by eye and windowed in 90×90 pixel images. Defocus values were estimated from digitized micrographs using ctfit (EMAN) [61].\n\nWe generated a spEM reconstruction of Eco RNAP by analyzing ∼42,000 cryo-images of Eco RNAP particles (Figures 4A, S4–S6). Particle image orientation parameters were approximately determined using reference projections of a volume generated by low-pass filtration of the Taq core RNAP X-ray structure [5] to 35 Å-resolution. We used a previously devised protocol in which image orientation parameters are iteratively refined by cycling through sets comprising relatively small numbers of reference projections [62]. After a large number of iterations (130) using the SPIDER software package [63], we obtained a structure in which well-defined densities not present in the original model volume were apparent. Further refinement of image orientation parameters by projection matching [64] using the SPARX software package [25] yielded a structure of Eco core RNAP with a 0.5 Fourier-shell cutoff resolution of about 11.2 Å (Figure S4). For further analysis, the map was Fourier filtered using an ahyperbolic tangent low-pass filter [24] as implemented in the SPARX software package [25] with a stop-band frequency of 0.28 and a fall-off of 0.45.\n\nSequence Alignments\n\nAlignments for the Eco lineage-specific insertions (see Datasets S1–S3) were created using the bacterial lineage-specific insertions alignments from Lane et al. [3] as a starting point. The final alignments were created by iterative cycles in which sequences that did not match the Eco domains were removed, followed by re-alignment with MUSCLE [65] or PCMA [66].\n\nAccession Numbers\n\nElectron Microscopy Data Bank: The single-particle cryoEM reconstruction volume has been deposited under ID code EMD-5169.
