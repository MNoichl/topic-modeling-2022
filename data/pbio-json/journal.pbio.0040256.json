  "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation is limited by our ability to efficiently identify the genomic locations of adaptive mutations. Here we describe a method that can quickly and precisely map the genetic basis of naturally and experimentally evolved complex traits using linkage analysis. A yeast strain that expresses the evolved trait is crossed to a distinct strain background and DNA from a large pool of progeny that express the trait of interest is hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays that detect thousands of polymorphisms between the two strains. Adaptive mutations are detected by linkage to the polymorphisms from the evolved parent. We successfully tested our method by mapping five known genes to a precision of 0.2–24 kb (0.1–10 cM), and developed computer simulations to test the effect of different factors on mapping precision. We then applied this method to four yeast strains that had independently adapted to a fluctuating glucose–galactose environment. All four strains had acquired one or more missense mutations in \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80, the repressor of the galactose utilization pathway. When transferred into the ancestral strain, the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations conferred the fitness advantage that the evolved strains show in the transition from glucose to galactose. Our results show an example of parallel adaptation caused by mutations in the same gene.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nCharacterizing the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary adaptation is important for understanding the emergence of new phenotypes. Experimental evolution makes it possible to follow the evolutionary history of populations exposed to known selective pressures. Moreover, the reproducibility of evolutionary paths can be explored by comparing identical, independent experiments. Such studies are beginning to shed light on the genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation [1–4], but many questions remain open, such as how rare gain-of-function mutations are relative to loss-of-function ones, and how often similar phenotypic adaptations are the result of similar genetic changes. A major challenge is finding the adaptive (beneficial) mutations without having to make prior assumptions about their type or site.\n\nSeveral strategies have been used to search for mutations associated with evolved traits. These include sequencing candidate genes [5–7], tracking the insertion sites of mobile genetic elements [8–10], partial- or whole-genome sequencing [1,\n\t\t\t\t11–13], gene expression profiling [2,\n\t\t\t\t14], identifying large chromosomal rearrangements [8,\n\t\t\t\t15], and linkage analysis [16–18]. Some of these approaches rely on the assumption that mutations found repeatedly in several independently evolved populations are likely to be beneficial. Ultimately, the effects of the mutations on the evolved phenotypes have to be verified experimentally [3,\n\t\t\t\t4,\n\t\t\t\t19].\n\nLinkage analysis is the least biased and most general method for finding adaptive mutations in a background of neutral ones. It relies on linkage between the mutations that produce the phenotype of interest and neutral genetic markers (DNA polymorphisms) that can be easily followed, and thus makes no assumptions about the nature or locations of the adaptive mutations [20,\n\t\t\t\t21]. Such analyses are often applied to progeny (segregants) from a cross between two strains that differ for both the selected trait and the genetic markers. Advances in genome technology have enabled simultaneous genotyping of thousands of DNA polymorphism markers by hybridizing genomic DNA to oligonucleotide arrays [22,\n\t\t\t\t23]. This has led to better genome coverage and mapping resolution, as demonstrated on several traits in budding yeast, including growth at high temperature and sporulation efficiency [22,\n\t\t\t\t24,\n\t\t\t\t25]. However, such quantitative trait mapping methods are laborious and expensive for mapping multiple traits or multiple strains (e.g., strains evolved in parallel experiments), as they usually require the genotyping of multiple individual segregants for each strain or trait being mapped. One solution is to mix DNA from many individuals expressing the trait of interest, and genotype it as a pool (selective DNA pooling; [26]). A variety of pooled DNA genotyping methods have been used in association studies in humans [27–30], as well as in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in plants and animals, where experimental crosses are possible [31–36].\n\nHere we map mutations in the budding yeast, \n\t\t\t\tSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which we use as a model organism to study the genetic basis of experimentally evolved traits ([37]; see also [4]). To overcome the limitations described above, we used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to genotype a single large pool of segregants that express the trait of interest, an approach also used in plants [33]. This strategy reduces the number of microarrays needed for mapping, and increases mapping resolution due to the wide variety of recombination breakpoints present in a large pool of segregants. We tested and optimized our method on five known genetic loci and developed computer simulations to test the effect of various factors on mapping precision. We then applied it to four yeast strains that have been evolved in an environment where they were exposed to a regular alternation of carbon sources. The adaptive phenotype was mapped to the same locus in all four strains. We identified the adaptive mutations in the mapped regions and experimentally verified their contribution to the evolved trait.\n\n      Results\n      \n        A Bulk Segregant Mapping Method\n        \nA schematic description of the mapping method is presented in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 1. Briefly, a haploid yeast strain that expresses the trait of interest (the target strain) is crossed to a reference strain that lacks the trait and differs from the target strain at thousands of polymorphic sites (Figure 1A). The hybrid diploid is then sporulated (undergoes meiosis), giving rise to a diverse pool of recombinant haploid progeny (segregants) that contain different combinations of their parents' genomic DNA. A large pool of segregants that express the trait of interest is selected from the progeny (the selected pool); as a control, a random pool of similar size is collected without selecting for the trait (the control pool). DNA from each pool is hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray that detects the polymorphic sites. If it is difficult to select simultaneously for multiple segregants that express the trait, single progeny can be screened individually for the phenotype and later pooled for the linkage analysis. For each locus, the extent of hybridization reveals the fraction of the DNA that is derived from the target strain (Figure 1B); regions where the target strain's genotype is overrepresented in the selected pool relative to the control pool are predicted to contain mutations that contribute to the trait of interest (target loci).\n\n        Genetic Map Construction for Linkage Analysis\n        \nThe first step in mapping is finding loci that are polymorphic between the target and reference strains. We identified these by hybridizing the genomic DNA of the target and reference strains separately onto high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Oligonucleotides (features) that hybridized significantly more strongly to DNA of the target strain than to that of the reference strain were the polymorphic features considered in this study (single-feature polymorphisms [SFPs]). We identified SFPs with a detection algorithm that uses a one-tailed two-sample \n\t\t\t\t\tt test (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods) and estimated its sensitivity and specificity using two strains (S288c and YJM789) whose genomic DNA sequences are known (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). We identified 4,438 S288c/YJM789 SFPs out of 12,602 true SFPs at a \n\t\t\t\t\tp value of 10−6, yielding a true-positive rate of 35.22% (fraction of the true polymorphic features that are scored as polymorphic) at an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 6.74% (fraction of detected SFPs that are not truly polymorphic) (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S1). At this \n\t\t\t\t\tp value, we detect 45% of the SFPs where the sequence difference between the two strains lies in the central 15 bases of the 25-base oligonucleotide on the array. We chose a \n\t\t\t\t\tp value cutoff of 10−6 for SFP identification as it gave the highest true-positive–to–false discovery rate ratio of the cutoffs tested.\n\n        Mapping Method Tested on Five Known Genes\n        \nWe asked whether we could use pools of segregants from single crosses to map known genetic loci. We chose W303 and SK1 as the target and reference yeast strains as they are widely used in laboratory studies and a high level of polymorphism was reported between them [23]. Using our SFP detection algorithm, we identified 10,330 W303/SK1 SFPs at an estimated FDR of 2.9%, resulting in an average marker density of 1 SFP per ̃1.1 kb or ̃0.4 cM (the distribution of distances between SFPs is shown in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S2). These SFPs made up the genetic map used for the linkage analyses in this work.\n\nWe tested the performance of our method by mapping one metabolic and four drug resistance genes whose chromosomal locations are known (details in \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). The target strain was a derivative of W303 that carries alleles that confer resistance to four drugs, canavanine \n\t\t\t\t\t(can1), geneticin \n\t\t\t\t\t(KANR),\n\t\t\t\t\t hygromycin \n\t\t\t\t\t(HYGR),\n\t\t\t\t\t and nourseothricin \n\t\t\t\t\t(NATR),\n\t\t\t\t\t and that can produce lysine \n\t\t\t\t\t(LYS5). It was crossed to the reference strain, a derivative of SK1 that is sensitive to all four drugs and cannot make lysine \n\t\t\t\t\t(lys5), and the hybrid diploid was sporulated. To simultaneously map \n\t\t\t\t\tLYS5 and \n\t\t\t\t\tcan1, we selected approximately 107 segregants that grew in liquid medium lacking lysine and containing canavanine. To map \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR, HYGR,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR,\n\t\t\t\t\t we selected a second pool of approximately 107 segregants in liquid medium containing geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin (Clonat). A control pool of segregants of comparable size was isolated in rich medium without drugs. The genomic DNA of each selected and control pool was hybridized to four identical arrays. The hybridization intensities of the selected and control pools and the target strain at the W303/SK1 SFPs were converted into a linkage map score (LMS) by analyzing the intensities across a moving window along the genome that included 50 SFPs (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). This score reflects the probability that a given chromosomal region is linked to the selected trait (for further discussion, see \n\t\t\t\t\tProtocol S1). We used simulations to estimate the minimum LMS that we considered significant. The order of the SFPs was scrambled 1,000 times, for each ordering we recorded the highest LMS found across the genome, and we considered peaks in the unpermuted data significant only if they exceeded the 99th percentile of the ranked maximum scores from the permuted simulations (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 2 shows the LMS for the chromosomes containing the mapped loci, and \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S3 shows the LMS across the entire genome.\n\nA total of six peaks were found above the cutoff: two for the \n\t\t\t\t\tcan1, LYS5 pool and four for the \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR, HYGR,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR\n\t\t\t\t\t pool. Of the six peaks, five corresponded to the five selected genes (Figure 2). We used mapping deviation, the distance between the center of a mapped peak and the center of the linked target gene, as a measure of mapping precision. In addition, we estimated 95% confidence intervals for each mapped locus using computer simulations (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). The mapping deviations of the five genes, 0.2, 1.7, 8.3, 9.5, and 24 kb (̃0.1–10 cM) for \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR, can1, HYGR, LYS5,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR,\n\t\t\t\t\t respectively, all fell within their 95% confidence intervals, which ranged from ±10 to ±44 kb (±4 to ±18 cM). The mapping deviations are robust to the array preprocessing method used (see \n\t\t\t\t\tTables S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2, and \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S4). This test case demonstrates that genes proximal to the centromere or telomere \n\t\t\t\t\t(can1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR)\n\t\t\t\t\t can be mapped at high resolution, and that two genes on the same chromosome arm can be easily separated from each other \n\t\t\t\t\t(HYGR\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR).\n\t\t\t\t\t The LMS is influenced by several factors, including SFP density, local recombination frequency, and the variance of the hybridization to individual probes on the array. As a result, the differences between the LMSs of the different peaks do not reflect the quantitative contribution of the different loci to the selected phenotype (see \n\t\t\t\t\tProtocol S1).\n\nAside from one potential false-positive peak found on Chromosome 10 at position 146.3 ± 30 kb, the signal-to-noise levels of the LMS was high (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigures S3 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS5). One possible interpretation for the extra peak is that it has uncovered real DNA differences between the target (W303) and reference (SK1) strains that contribute to the resistance to one or more of the drugs used for the selection. The failure to observe this peak in the \n\t\t\t\t\tcan1, LYS5 pool supports this hypothesis, although we found no obvious candidates for genes whose polymorphisms might contribute to drug resistance in the 95% confidence interval on Chromosome 10.\n\nTo assess the consistency of our mapping precision, \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR, HYGR,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR\n\t\t\t\t\t were mapped in two additional selected pools derived from different initial W303/SK1 hybrid diploids, yielding a total of three completely independent mapping experiments (unpublished data). The genes' mean mapping deviations and their standard deviations are 7.5 ± 6.4 kb, 4.1 ± 3.6 kb, and 14.9 ± 8.6 kb, respectively, with a total mean mapping deviation of 8.8 kb.\n\nFor some organisms or phenotypes, selecting for 107 segregants that express the trait of interest is impractical. We therefore asked whether we could map the \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR, HYGR,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR\n\t\t\t\t\t alleles with 104 or 100 segregants. Even with 100 segregants, the three drug-resistance genes were mapped to within 50 kb of their correct locations (Table 1; see \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S3 for whole-genome maps). No significant correlation was seen between the mapping precision of the three genes and pool size (100, 104, and 107 segregants) (\n\t\t\t\t\tp &gt; 0.6, \n\t\t\t\t\tt test).\n\nA variety of factors could cause alleles that contribute to a trait to be absent from some members of a pool that had been selected to express the trait strongly. To examine the robustness of our method to such deviations, we tested whether three drug-resistance genes could be mapped when their enrichment level in the selected pool is close to 70%–75% instead of 90%–100% as with our test case. Thus, we mixed equal amounts of DNA from a pool of segregants selected for resistance to geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin and a control, unselected pool, yielding an approximately 3:1 ratio of target strain polymorphisms to reference polymorphisms in regions linked to the drug resistance genes. Although the LMSs were greatly reduced, we still observed three peaks that corresponded to the three selected genes, demonstrating that we can map alleles that are absent from a substantial fraction of the selected pool (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S3J). In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio of the LMSs was still substantially high (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S5).\n\n        Computer Simulations of the Mapping Process\n        \nWe developed a computer model that simulates the whole mapping process (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods) to assess the effect of experimental design (e.g., number of arrays), intrinsic genetic factors (e.g., recombination rate), and adjustable statistical parameters (e.g., \n\t\t\t\t\tp value cutoff for SFP detection) on mapping precision. \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 3 presents the effect of the number of array replicates, noise levels between replicate intensities (coefficient of variation, the standard deviation divided by the mean), SFP FDR, SFP density (number of SFPs per 1 kb), and recombination rate on mapping deviation. Aside from the factor being varied, the parameters for the simulations were taken from our mapping experiments. The mapping deviations obtained with simulations are consistent with the experimentally observed mapping deviations for the five test case genes. Of the factors tested, SFP density and recombination rate displayed the strongest effect on mapping precision, with higher SFP density and higher recombination rate improving mapping precision. Even in regions with a ten-fold lower SFP density than average (̃99% of SFPs lie in denser regions; \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S2) or a four-fold lower recombination rate than average, our simulations suggest that a gene can successfully be mapped, albeit with lower resolution. We tested the effect of SFP density in our experiments by excluding varying fractions of the SFPs that lay near \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR\n\t\t\t\t\t from our analysis, to create an SFP density that ranged from 1.8 to 0.2 SFPs/kb. The negative trend of mapping deviation as a function of SFP density seen in simulations (Pearson's correlation coefficient \n\t\t\t\t\tR2\n\t\t\t\t\t = −0.96 for mapping deviation versus logarithm of SFP density) corresponded closely to that observed in this manipulation of our experimental data (\n\t\t\t\t\tR2\n\t\t\t\t\t = −0.95). As increased SFP FDR has little impact on mapping precision, especially in our observed experimental range (3%–7%), choosing a more liberal cutoff for identifying SFPs might help to map genes located in regions with low SFP density. In contrast, the number of array replicates and coefficient of variation between replicate intensities show only a weak effect on mapping precision, in particular in the ranges relevant for our study (two to four arrays, and coefficient of variation of 8%–15%). The simulations suggest that duplicate arrays for the selected and control pools suffice, which is in agreement with our mapping results of the test genes (see \n\t\t\t\t\tTable S3).\n\n        Mapping an Experimentally Evolved Trait in Yeast\n        \nWe used our mapping method to uncover the genetic basis of an experimentally evolved trait in yeast. We chose four W303 populations, derived from the same ancestor, that had been alternately grown in glucose- and galactose-containing media for 36 sexual cycles as part of a selection for altered mating preference [37] (Figure 4A). A single haploid clone was chosen from each population after the 36th cycle of selection. After ̃700 generations all four strains had evolved to resume proliferation more rapidly than their ancestors when transferred from glucose- to galactose-containing medium (see below). \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3, which encodes a coinducer of the galactose pathway [38], was found to be overexpressed three- to five-fold in the evolved strains compared with the ancestor when grown in medium with glucose as the sole carbon source (unpublished data).\n\nWe used \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3 as a reporter gene to select for segregants from crosses between the evolved strains and SK1 (Ev/SK1) that express the adaptive phenotype. For each of the four evolved strains, about 104 Ev/SK1 segregants that expressed high levels of Gal3 fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) were selected using flow cytometry (see \n\t\t\t\t\tMaterials and Methods). The genomic DNA of the control and selected pools were hybridized onto two or three replicate arrays each and the LMS was calculated for the entire genome (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S6). In all four strains, the adaptive phenotype was mapped to the same region on Chromosome 13 with a mean peak center of 173.3 kb and a mean 95% confidence interval of ±36 kb (±14 cM; \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 4B). An additional peak linked to \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3-GFP on chromosome 4 was found for strain Ev2 because the Ev2/SK1 hybrid diploid was heterozygous for the \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3-\n\t\t\t\t\tGFP, with the one copy of \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3-\n\t\t\t\t\tGFP lying on the chromosome derived from the evolved strain, while the other strains were homozygous for \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3-\n\t\t\t\t\tGFP (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S6).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80, which encodes the key repressor of the galactose utilization pathway [39], lies within 1 kb of the mean center of the linked intervals. We therefore sequenced this gene in the four evolved strains and in the ancestor. One or two missense mutations were found in \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 in all four strains (Figure 4C). Two of the strains carry the same mutation. One of the mutations, Q392H, has been recently identified in a screen for \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 mutations that cause loss of the Gal80 inhibitory activity [40]. Three other mutations, I361M, Q392H, and H36Y, lie in nuclear localization sequence regions of Gal80 [41]. The transcriptional regulation of the galactose utilization pathway, including the role of Gal80, is depicted in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 5A.\n\nTo test whether these mutations account for the adaptive phenotype, the endogenous \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 gene of the ancestral cells was replaced with the three different mutant genes, and the growth curves of these haploid strains were compared to those of the ancestor and a \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ strain. Compared to the ancestral allele, all the mutations in \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 conferred a growth advantage during the transition from using glucose as the sole carbon source to galactose (̃2-fold increase at 6 h; \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 5B–5D). However, no significant growth differences were observed for cells transferred from glucose- to glucose-containing medium or from galactose- to galactose-containing medium (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S7A–\n\t\t\t\t\tS7H). The ancestral strains carrying the evolved \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations behaved similarly to the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ strain, suggesting that the mutations in \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 cause a partial or complete loss-of-function of Gal80′s repressive activity on the galactose utilization pathway (Figure 5E). Hence, the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations explain the growth advantage observed for the four evolved stains relative to the ancestor following transfer from glucose to galactose (̃1.2–1.9-fold more evolved cells than ancestral cells 6 h after transfer; \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 5F–5I). The slower growth observed for the ancestor compared with the evolved strains in the transition from glucose to galactose is likely the result of a growth delay while the ancestral cells repress Gal80′s inhibitory effect and induce the genes required for galactose uptake and catabolism.\n\nWe compared the effects of the mutations in \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 in two strains: the evolved strains and the strains produced by transforming these mutations into the ancestral strain. Ancestral cells carrying only the evolved \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations have a larger growth advantage relative to the ancestral \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 strains than do the evolved strains from which these mutations were rescued (compare \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 5B–5D to 5F–5H). This difference is probably due to one or more other mutations that accumulated in the evolved strains and have a fitness cost under the conditions of our experiment. The slight decrease in fitness observed for the evolved strains (Ev2 and Ev42) relative to the ancestor when transferred from one glucose-containing medium to another supports this hypothesis (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S7E–\n\t\t\t\t\tS7L).\n\nDuring each cycle of the evolution experiment, diploid evolving cells were transferred from glucose- to galactose-containing medium (Figure 4A). This selection prompted us to ask whether a single copy of the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations conferred any advantage on a diploid background. We compared the growth curve of ancestral diploids heterozygous for one of the three sets of \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations to that of an ancestral diploid, a \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ/\n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ diploid\n\t\t\t\t\t, and a \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80/\n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ diploid, following transfer from glucose to galactose (Figure 5J–5M). The intermediate growth levels of the heterozygous \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80/\n\t\t\t\t\tEv-gal80 diploid and the \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80/gal80Δ diploid compared with the ancestor and the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ/gal80Δ diploid show that all three sets of \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations, similar to \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ, are phenotypically semidominant. In a molecular sense, this argues that the \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 gene is weakly haploinsufficient, most likely because of its need to titrate Gal4, the transcriptional activator. In an evolutionary sense, our observations suggest that the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations could have been initially selected for when only one copy of the mutation/s was present in the diploid.\n\n      Discussion\n      \nWe present an optimized method that maps adaptive mutations in yeast with higher precision and less work than previous linkage-based mapping methods [22,\n\t\t\t\t24,\n\t\t\t\t25]. One advantage of our method is the capacity to predict where the linked locus is most likely to lie within a mapped region, which helps prioritize sequencing and candidate gene testing. Therefore, even though our estimated 95% confidence intervals (20–88 kb [8–35 cM]) are comparable with mapping intervals identified in previous SFP-based methods that analyze ̃20 segregants individually in yeast (8–72 kb [3–29 cM]) [22,\n\t\t\t\t24,\n\t\t\t\t25], the centers of our mapping predictions are typically much closer to the actual mutations. By pooling at least 10,000 segregants from a single cross, we obtained mapping deviations of test genes that ranged from 0.2–24 kb (0.1–10 cM). In four independently evolved populations, mutations in the same gene \n\t\t\t\t(GAL80) were mapped with a mean mapping deviation of 5.7 kb, and the average position of the four predicted positions was 1 kb from the center of the \n\t\t\t\tGAL80 gene. Furthermore, pooling makes mapping easier and cheaper than analyzing single segregants. We can analyze more than 107 selected segregants simultaneously using fewer arrays (a minimum of four) than are needed to individually analyze ̃20 single segregants (20 arrays). In both methods, additional arrays (at least two) are needed for the initial, one-time prediction of SFPs. If necessary, our method can be applied to pools that contain as few as 100 segregants. This is important for organisms that produce few progeny, or for phenotypes that must be assessed by assaying individually selected segregants, which are then assembled into pools, rather than directly selecting on pooled meiotic progeny.\n\nSince our method can simultaneously map multiple genes with high efficiency, including genes lying on the same arm \n\t\t\t\t(HYGR\n\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\tNATR)\n\t\t\t\t and genes affecting a quantitative phenotype \n\t\t\t\t(GAL80), our method could be useful for multigenic or QTL mapping. This combination of high-throughput genotyping with oligonucleotide arrays [22] and pooling [27] has also been applied in plants [33,\n\t\t\t\t34], and should accelerate QTL detection compared with traditional single-segregant mapping methods in a wide variety of organisms [20,\n\t\t\t\t21,\n\t\t\t\t42,\n\t\t\t\t43]. Our method has advantages and disadvantages compared to other forms of QTL mapping. We do not make assumptions on the number of contributing QTLs or the type of interactions between them, as multiple QTL and composite interval mapping methods must do [21]. By selecting and genotyping pools with extreme phenotypic values, we gain mapping power, but we cannot estimate the relative effect of individual QTLs on a trait. Previous studies show that QTL effect can be estimated by genotyping pools with broader phenotypic values from the lower and upper tails of the phenotypic distribution and associating the differences in phenotypic means of the two pools to differences in their marker allele frequencies [35,\n\t\t\t\t44,\n\t\t\t\t45]. Another issue is that pools lack information on the phase between genetic markers (e.g., haplotypes) and QTLs, making it hard to learn about the type of interactions between QTLs (e.g., additive or epistatic) or to recognize distinct subsets of QTLs that can independently give rise to the same trait [27]. Since pool genotyping is commonly used in human association studies [27,\n\t\t\t\t30], it would be interesting to explore whether our method and its statistical framework could be extended to such studies [46].\n\nWe developed a computer model that simulates the mapping process to better understand the effects of various factors on mapping precision, and to improve our experimental protocols. The parameters of the model can be adjusted so that the simulations can be applied to other experimental designs, such as backcrosses, and to different organisms. Our simulations suggest that marker density and recombination rate are the major factors affecting mapping precision. While we have generated a very dense genetic map of about 10,300 DNA markers (on average ̃1 SFP/kb), the model predicts that with tighter genetic marker spacing (two to four markers per kb) our method could reach even higher mapping resolutions, corresponding to a few genes in yeast (̃1–2 cM). Tiling arrays that contain oligonucleotides that cover the whole genome and that are available for some organisms (recently including yeast [47]) will provide such high SFP coverage. Alternatively, different reference strains with different polymorphism distributions compared with the target strain can be used to increase genome coverage and marker density.\n\nWe showed that four independently evolved strains found the same genetic solution to repeated transitions from glucose- to galactose-containing medium and two of the strains independently acquired the same mutation. All three sets of mutations in \n\t\t\t\tGAL80 reduced its ability to repress genes involved in galactose metabolism. Thus, we observed parallel evolution at the genetic level, as has been seen in viruses, bacteria, and yeast that have been experimentally adapted to stressful conditions [1,\n\t\t\t\t2,\n\t\t\t\t4], and in fish with pelvic and armor plate reduction, and albinism [17,\n\t\t\t\t48,\n\t\t\t\t49]. Mutations in \n\t\t\t\tGAL3 or \n\t\t\t\tGAL4 have been shown to lead to constitutive expression of the galactose utilization pathway [50,\n\t\t\t\t51]. We did not find gain-of-function mutations in these genes, most likely because the target size for loss-of-function mutations in \n\t\t\t\tGAL80 is much larger than that for gain-of-function mutations in \n\t\t\t\tGAL3 or \n\t\t\t\tGAL4. All the missense mutations we found in \n\t\t\t\tGAL80 lie in residues that are highly conserved across yeast species from \n\t\t\t\tSaccharomyces cerevisiae to \n\t\t\t\tKluyveromyces lactis (\n\t\t\t\tFigure S8). Our results, together with other studies [2,\n\t\t\t\t17], support the notion that mutations in regulatory genes may lead to large benefits in populations subjected to changing environments.\n\nAlthough much effort has gone into studying evolutionary changes in experimental and natural populations [3,\n\t\t\t\t52], many questions remain. Is there correlation between the number, effect, and nature of the adaptive mutations and the molecular pathways that are subjected to the selective pressure? To what extent do evolutionary paths overlap at the genetic level between populations subjected to identical selective pressures and how does such overlap depend on the underlying network? The high-throughput and high-resolution aspects of our mapping method (freely available at \n\t\t\t\thttp://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping) make it amenable for such large-scale studies in yeast or higher eukaryotic organisms, as well as for studying the genetic basis of quantitative traits.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Yeast strains, techniques, and media.\n        \nThe genotypes of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in \n\t\t\t\t\tTable S4. The target strain for our test mapping (AVS4) was a W303 strain, JYL13 \n\t\t\t\t\t(MATa ura3–1 his3–11,15 trp1–1 ade2–1 can1–100) transformed with three drug-resistance genes, \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR, HYGR,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR,\n\t\t\t\t\t which had been integrated at the following intergenic locations: \n\t\t\t\t\tKANR\n\t\t\t\t\t on Chromosome 7 at position 413,409 bp (between \n\t\t\t\t\tALG13 and \n\t\t\t\t\tRIM8), \n\t\t\t\t\tHYGR\n\t\t\t\t\t on Chromosome 15 at position 619,115 bp (between \n\t\t\t\t\tYOR152c and \n\t\t\t\t\tPDR5), and \n\t\t\t\t\tNATR\n\t\t\t\t\t at Chromosome 15 at position 960,610 bp (between \n\t\t\t\t\tRPA43 and \n\t\t\t\t\tRPA190). The reference strain used for the test case is a derivative of SK1, JYL394 \n\t\t\t\t\t(MATα ura3 (ΔSmaI-PstI) trp1::hisG leu2::hisG lys5Δ::3xHA ho::hisG GAL3) [53]. The YJM789 strain was provided to us by the Ron Davis lab \n\t\t\t\t\t(MATα ho::hisG gal2 lys2) [54], and the S288c strain was BY4742 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). The evolved strains originated from strains isogenic with W303 (JYL243 and JYL246). Yeast transformations were carried out by the lithium acetate procedure [55]. Media, microbial, and genetic techniques were as described [56].\n\nTo map known genes, the target and reference strains were mated and single, manually isolated diploids were grown overnight in YEP (yeast extract peptone) + 2% potassium acetate (KAc) and then sporulated in 2% KAc for 3 d. Haploid segregants from this cross were grown overnight in one of three liquid media: (1) synthetic medium lacking arginine, lysine, and containing canavanine (complete synthetic media [CSM] − lysine − arginine + 60 μg/ml L-canavanine [Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States]) to select for Lys+, Canr cells; (2) rich medium containing geneticin, hygromycin, and nourseothricin (YPD [1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose] + 400 μg/ml geneticin [G418; Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, California, United States] + 300 μg/ml hygromycin B [Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States] + 100 μg/ml nourseothricin [Clonat; Werner BioAgents, Jena, Germany]) to select for Kanr, Hygr, Natr cells; or (3) rich medium (YPD) to produce the control pool. To select for 100 segregants, the asci of the sporulated hybrid diploid were digested and the spores were immediately plated on selective medium. Colonies (100) representing individual segregants were picked and mixed in equal amounts.\n\n        Evolution experiment.\n        \nThe four evolved populations originated from the same ancestral strain in four separate, replicate experiments. In each cycle of evolution, haploid cells were grown in glucose-containing media for 4 d, mated on YPD plates and transferred to galactose-containing media for 2 d, and then put through a sporulation cycle. There were 36 such cycles for each population. The primary motivation of this experiment was to evolve mating discrimination (described in [37]). The evolving and ancestral cells were genetically designed so that cycles of exposure to glucose and galactose would contribute to the selection for an altered mating preference in the evolving population. During the whole procedure, the effective population size was maintained at more than 105 cells.\n\n        Selection for segregants expressing adaptive phenotype.\n        \nTo map the adaptive mutations in the evolved strains, a single representative clone was isolated from each evolved population (see [37]). Since high \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3 expression was found in the evolved strains relative to the ancestor (unpublished results), we chose \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3 as a reporter gene for the adaptive glucose-galactose phenotype. The gene encoding green fluorescent protein, \n\t\t\t\t\tGFP, was fused to the C-terminus of \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3 at \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL3's endogenous chromosomal location. The evolved clones and an ancestral clone (as a control) were then mated with a reference SK1 strain (JYL631 and JYL632) and sporulated. Haploid segregants in mid-log growth phase in YPD were sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; DakoCytomation MoFlo Cell Sorter, Carpinteria, California, United States) according to Gal3-GFP intensity (using excitation at 488 nm and a 505–555-nm emission filter). The brightest 5% of cells were collected and a total of 104 cells were isolated and amplified for genomic DNA extraction. A 1:1 mixture of ancestral cells and ancestral cells transformed with the \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 mutations, both carrying Gal3-GFP, showed a bimodal distribution of GFP expression, demonstrating that the ancestral and evolved populations could be cleanly separated.\n\n        Genomic DNA hybridizations.\n        \nFor genotyping and linkage analysis, genomic DNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix Yeast S98 arrays (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx) that contain 25mer probes designed using the genomic DNA sequence of the S288c strain. Total genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Genomic-Tip 100/G kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) and brought to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl in distilled water. For each sample, 10 μg of DNA was digested, labeled, and hybridized onto an array according to standard Affymetrix protocols for RNA hybridization (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.affymetrix.com/support/index.affx). We reduced the concentration of NaCl in the hybridization solution to 0.45 M in order to shift the average hybridization intensity away from saturation to an average of 1,000–3,000 U. Hybridized arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix scanner (GeneChip Scanner 3000) and the .CEL files (version 3) were used for the mapping analyses. The genomic DNA of the target and reference strains was hybridized onto eight array replicates each, and the selected and control pools onto two to four replicates.\n\n        Array feature sequence analysis.\n        \nWe refer to the oligonucleotides on microarrays as features. Each of the 136,934 Perfect Match (PM) 25mer probes on the Affymetrix Yeast Genome S98 array were blasted against the S288c genome (\n\t\t\t\t\tftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/sequence/genomic_sequence/chromosomes/fasta) from which the probe sequences were designed. Only features that met the following criteria were used in this study: (1) they have a unique perfect match against the S288c genome; (2) they do not lie in repetitive regions, such as telomeres, centromeres, yeast autonomous replication sequences (ARS), or mobile genetic elements (feature positions downloaded from \n\t\t\t\t\tftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/yeast/sequence/genomic_sequence/other_features/other_features_genomic.fasta.gz); and (3) they do not lie in mitochondrial sequences. In cases where two fully complementary probes were found, only one of the two was kept to avoid probe redundancy. A table with the chromosome locations, \n\t\t\t\t\tx and \n\t\t\t\t\ty array coordinates, and the sequences of the resulting 120,050 probes is available at \n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping.\n\n        Array preprocessing and normalization.\n        \nThe raw signal intensities of the PM and Mismatch (MM) features on Affymetrix yeast arrays were extracted from .CEL files (version 3) obtained from array scans. The intensities of the 120,050 features described above were read into a matrix with their array coordinates. All arrays were processed as follows: (1) Probe preprocessing. MM intensities were subtracted from their corresponding PM values [57], as this yielded comparable or slightly better mapping results compared with other probe preprocessing methods (see \n\t\t\t\t\tTables S1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tS2). Negative values were set to one. (2) Normalization. To normalize between arrays and to correct for spatial hybridization inhomogeneities on the array, the intensity of each feature following MM subtraction was divided by a spatial local median intensity. A local median was calculated for each feature as the median intensity of an invariant set of PM features (nonpolymorphic between the target and reference strains) that fell within a window of 30 by 30 features centered around the given feature. Nonpolymorphic features were identified with a one-tailed two-sample \n\t\t\t\t\tt test at a \n\t\t\t\t\tp value range of 0.05–0.95. The analysis was implemented in Perl and can be downloaded at \n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping. The user has the option of choosing between different preprocessing and normalization methods in the mapping software.\n\n        SFP identification.\n        \nThe SFPs considered in this study are array features whose mean hybridization intensities are significantly higher in the target strain relative to the reference strain. SFPs were identified using a one-tailed two-sample \n\t\t\t\t\tt test [58] between eight hybridization replicates of the target strain, \n\t\t\t\t\tW303, and the reference strain, SK1 at \n\t\t\t\t\tp = 10−6. The test statistic \n\t\t\t\t\tt with ν degrees of freedom for sample \n\t\t\t\t\tb compared with sample \n\t\t\t\t\ta at SFP number \n\t\t\t\t\ti (ti,a,b)\n\t\t\t\t\t is given in \n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 1 (for ν equation see [58], p. 129):\n\nwhere \n\t\t\t\t\ta and \n\t\t\t\t\tb refer to the target strain and reference strain, respectively, \n\t\t\t\t\t denotes the mean intensity of sample \n\t\t\t\t\tk onto SFP number \n\t\t\t\t\ti across \n\t\t\t\t\tnk\n\t\t\t\t\t replicate arrays, and \n\t\t\t\t\t denotes the variance between \n\t\t\t\t\tnk\n\t\t\t\t\t replicate hybridization intensities for sample \n\t\t\t\t\tk at SFP \n\t\t\t\t\ti. The hybridization intensities are assumed to be normally distributed, a reasonable approximation according to our tests (unpublished data). Equal variances are not assumed for the two samples, as SFPs by definition refer to features with distinct intensities between two samples; variances were calculated from the observed replicate intensities.\n\n        SFP verification and optimization.\n        \nTo optimize our algorithm for identifying SFPs and to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of our method, we used two strains whose genomes have been sequenced, S288c and YJM789 (sequenced by the Stanford Genome Technology Center [54]). We blasted the 120,050 Affymetrix probes, whose sequences were taken from S288c, against the YJM789 genome. We found that 107,448 probes are perfectly matched to at least one region in both genomes, and 12,602 probes are polymorphic (SFPs), with a prefect match to a unique sequence in S288c and no perfect match in YJM789. We hybridized the genomic DNA of S288c and YJM789 onto eight arrays each and SFPs were predicted using the array preprocessing and normalization, and SFP identification algorithms described above. The false-positive rate calculated for S288c/YJM789 can be used to estimate an FDR between any two strains at a given significance level and given number of array replicates. For this, an estimated number of false-positive SFPs between the two strains, calculated as the S288c/YJM789 false-positive rate times the estimated number of nonpolymorphic features between the two given strains, is divided by the total number of features scored as polymorphic.\n\n        Linkage analysis of a single pool of segregants.\n        \nThe linkage analysis algorithms were implemented in Matlab, and are available at \n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.cgr.harvard.edu/MutationMapping. A linkage likelihood ratio \n\t\t\t\t\tLLR(i), which represents the level of linkage of the \n\t\t\t\t\tith\n\t\t\t\t\t SFP to the selected trait, was calculated for each of the 10,330 W303/SK1 SFPs along the genome (\n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 2). \n\t\t\t\t\tLLR(i) is the ratio between the probability that an SFP indexed \n\t\t\t\t\ti is linked to the target locus and the probability that it is unlinked:\n\nwhere \n\t\t\t\t\tT denotes the target strain, \n\t\t\t\t\tS the selected pool, and \n\t\t\t\t\tC the control pool. \n\t\t\t\t\t is the probability of observing \n\t\t\t\t\tt &gt; \n\t\t\t\t\tti,a,b\n\t\t\t\t\t in the \n\t\t\t\t\tt test for SFP \n\t\t\t\t\ti between sample \n\t\t\t\t\ta and sample \n\t\t\t\t\tb at ν degrees of freedom (see \n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 1), computed as\n\nwhere \n\t\t\t\t\tfν(\n\t\t\t\t\tt) is the \n\t\t\t\t\tt probability density with ν degrees of freedom. The working hypothesis is that as the distance between the SFP and the target locus decreases, the mean intensity of the selected pool onto the linked SFP increases and becomes more similar to the mean intensity of the target strain than that of the control pool. For unlinked SFPs, the intensity of the selected pool should be similar to that of the control pool.\n\nBased on the LLR values for all SFPs, we computed an LMS at equally spaced positions along the chromosome. These positions lie on a grid defined by an offset \n\t\t\t\t\tx0\n\t\t\t\t\t (the position of the \n\t\t\t\t\tqth\n\t\t\t\t\t SFP from the left-hand end of the chromosome) and an interval \n\t\t\t\t\tλ (in kilobases) (i.e., \n\t\t\t\t\tx(j) = λ · j + x0\n\t\t\t\t\t [for \n\t\t\t\t\tj =1,2,3,…jfinal\n\t\t\t\t\t]). \n\t\t\t\t\tjfinal\n\t\t\t\t\t is the index on the grid that corresponds to the \n\t\t\t\t\tqth\n\t\t\t\t\t SFP from the right-hand end of the chromosome. At each grid point \n\t\t\t\t\tx(j), LMS(j) is defined as the geometric mean of the LLR scores of the \n\t\t\t\t\tq first SFPs to the left and \n\t\t\t\t\tq SFPs to the right of \n\t\t\t\t\tx(j) (i.e., a moving window containing \n\t\t\t\t\t2q SFPs, indicated here as Ω\n\t\t\t\t\t\tq\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\tj)):\n\nFor all our linkage analyses, \n\t\t\t\t\tLMS(j) was plotted as a function of \n\t\t\t\t\tx(j). Here we used \n\t\t\t\t\tλ = 1 kb, and \n\t\t\t\t\tq = 25. This moving-window size of 50 SFPs (\n\t\t\t\t\tq = 25) was selected based on our simulations (described below), as this choice gave the lower mapping deviations among the window-size range tested (10–50 SFPs; an upper limit was set due to several considerations, including chromosome length and maintaining the ability to map multiple adjacent loci; see \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S9). Peaks whose predicted centers lay within 50 kb from a telomere were resmoothed with a window of 36 SFPs, which we found to be optimal for telomeric regions using simulations. Our simulation model can be used to find the optimal range of smoothing window size for different experimental designs, such as backcrosses, or other organisms that display different recombination rates.\n\n        Identifying significant peaks.\n        \nThe significant peaks, representing the linkage regions, were identified at a 99% confidence level using permutation analysis [59]. Briefly, the chromosome positions of all SFPs were randomly assigned to the observed hybridization intensities of the selected and control pools, while the coordinates of the target strain intensities remained in place. No shuffling was done between replicate array intensities or between the intensities of the selected and control pools. For each shuffling, the LMS was calculated across the entire genome and the maximum LMS value was recorded. This process was repeated 1,000 times, and the maximum LMS values from each shuffling were ranked. The 99th percentile of the ranked values was taken as the significant peak threshold.\n\n        Estimating significant peak center.\n        \nThe boundaries of each significant peak were determined using an LMS cutoff that equals 10% of the maximum height of the given peak. The center of a significant peak is defined as the position midway between two SFPs that best divide the area under the peak into two equal halves or into two areas that are closest to an equal split of the peak area. The peak area is calculated as the area under the peak between its two boundaries. To avoid false-positive spikes, peaks that were narrower than 25 kb were discarded. A 95% confidence interval around the predicted peak's center was estimated for each peak using computer simulations as described below.\n\n        Mapping simulations and 95% confidence intervals.\n        \nWe developed a computer model that simulates the entire linkage mapping process of a single selected locus. The linkage disequilibrium–based model assumes that recombination rate is proportional to the distance between two loci, and that two loci that are more than 50 cM apart are unlinked. The simulations are done at the level of the array hybridization intensities. The replicate hybridization intensities of the target strain and control pool, \n\t\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\ti)\n\t\t\t\t\t, onto an SFP indexed \n\t\t\t\t\ti are sampled from a normal distribution with a mean intensity, \n\t\t\t\t\tμa\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\ti) and standard deviation, \n\t\t\t\t\tσa\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\ti)\n\t\t\t\t\t. These values are taken from observed intensity data of sample \n\t\t\t\t\ta at SFP \n\t\t\t\t\ti (\n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 6).\n\nThe mean intensity of the selected pool onto SFP \n\t\t\t\t\ti is calculated according to \n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 7:\n\nwhere \n\t\t\t\t\tdi,t\n\t\t\t\t\t is the relative genetic distance between an SFP at position \n\t\t\t\t\tXi\n\t\t\t\t\t and a simulated target locus at position \n\t\t\t\t\tXt,\n\t\t\t\t\t and \n\t\t\t\t\tU denotes the average unlinked physical distance. We assume \n\t\t\t\t\tdi,t\n\t\t\t\t\t is proportional to the recombination rate between two loci, and \n\t\t\t\t\tU = 125 kb (̃50 cM) based on an average recombination rate of 1 cM per 2.5 kb in yeast. A relative distance (\n\t\t\t\t\tdi,t\n\t\t\t\t\t) of 1 represents no linkage, while a relative distance of 0 represents 100% linkage. \n\t\t\t\t\tT represents the target strain, \n\t\t\t\t\tC the control pool, and \n\t\t\t\t\tS the selected pool. The standard deviation of the hybridization intensities of the selected pool onto SFP \n\t\t\t\t\ti is derived from the coefficient of variation (μ/σ) of the control pool, as shown in \n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 8:\n\nFinally, the replicate hybridization intensities of the selected pool onto SFP \n\t\t\t\t\ti are sampled from a normal distribution with a mean intensity, \n\t\t\t\t\tμS\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\ti)\n\t\t\t\t\t, and a standard deviation, \n\t\t\t\t\tσS\n\t\t\t\t\t(\n\t\t\t\t\ti) (\n\t\t\t\t\tEquation 6). The linkage analysis procedure described in the previous section is applied to the simulated hybridization intensities of replicate arrays. The absolute value of the distance between the estimated center of the detected significant peak and the actual position of the simulated target locus is recorded for each simulation. The mapping deviation is defined as the 95th percentile of the ranked deviations calculated from \n\t\t\t\t\tn simulation runs. In this work, \n\t\t\t\t\tn = 1,000.\n\n        Testing the effect of different factors on mapping precision.\n        \nWe used simulations to test the effect of various factors on mapping precision of a target locus positioned in the middle of an average-length yeast chromosome (700 kb; \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 3). Five repeats of n = 1,000 simulation runs were done for each set of parameters tested. Aside from the varying factor, parameters were chosen according to those used or observed in our mapping test case, including an average recombination rate of 1 cM per 2.5 kb, SFP FDR of 6%, mean SFP density of 0.91 SFP/kb, four array replicates for the selected and control pools and eight replicates for the target strain, smoothing window size of 50 SFPs, and the SFP mean intensities and standard deviations of the target strain and control pool were randomly sampled without replacement from the distribution of replicate SFP intensities from our test case experiments. For each simulation run, a different subset of SFPs was randomly flagged as false positive, and the intensities of the false SFPs were randomly sampled from the observed intensities of the target strain at nonpolymorphic features.\n\n        95% confidence interval estimation.\n        \nTo estimate the 95% confidence intervals for a predicted linked region, a simulated target locus was positioned at the predicted center, and the 95th percentile of the ranked mapping deviations from 1,000 simulation runs was recorded. The distribution of SFP positions observed in our mapping experiments for a given chromosome was used for the simulations, as well as the observed mean intensities and coefficients of variation of the target strain and control pool at the corresponding SFPs. The estimated 95% confidence intervals are rough estimates, as a uniform mean recombination rate is assumed across the whole genome due to lack of detailed data on the local variation in recombination rate. As a result, when local recombination rates are higher than average, the 95% confidence intervals are placed too far away from the predicted position of the target locus, and when local rates are lower than average the intervals are placed too close to the predicted position.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 sequencing.\n\nTo sequence \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80, we amplified a fragment on Chromosome 13 from position 171,100 to 173,315 bp. We designed sequencing primers ̃400 bp apart on the same strand with ̃200-bp separations between primers on opposite strands. Both strands of the PCR product were sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) and the product read with an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer. The sequence readouts were assembled into a single contig using ContigExpress (part of VectorNTI software; Invitrogen); 2–4 × coverage was obtained.\n\n        Mutation reconstruction and growth curve assays.\n        \nTo reconstruct the evolved mutations in the ancestral strain, the mutant \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 genes and flanking sequences were amplified by PCR from the evolved strains and transformed into an ancestral strain whose \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 gene was replaced by a \n\t\t\t\t\tURA3 gene. The transformants were then plated on 5-fluoro-orotic acid–containing medium which selects against the \n\t\t\t\t\tURA3 gene and thus for cells where \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80Δ::URA3 has been replaced by the mutant \n\t\t\t\t\tgal80 genes. The structure of the \n\t\t\t\t\tGAL80 locus in each of the transformants was checked by PCR, and the genomic DNA was sequenced to show that the mutant allele had been properly integrated without introducing any further mutations. For growth curves, cells were grown in YPD (2% glucose) or YEP + 2% galactose (in the galactose-to-galactose transfers) overnight, diluted and refreshed in the same medium for 4 hours and then transferred to YPD or YEP + galactose medium. Cell numbers were estimated from the optical densities of the cell cultures using a spectrophotometer (DU640B; Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France). In each assay, at least three independent cultures were set up and their average and standard deviation is shown at each sample point.\n\n      Supporting Information\n\n        Accession Numbers\n        \nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) accession numbers for the genes and gene products discussed in this paper are S288c genome (NC_001133–NC_001148) and YJM789 genome (AAFW01000001–AAFW01000150).
