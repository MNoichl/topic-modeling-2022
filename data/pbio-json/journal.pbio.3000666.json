  "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an apical kinase of the DNA damage response following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); however, the mechanisms of ATM activation are not completely understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of regulatory molecules whose significant roles in DNA damage response have started to emerge. However, how lncRNA regulates ATM activity remains unknown. Here, we identify an inhibitor of ATM activation, lncRNA HITT (HIF-1α inhibitor at translation level). Mechanistically, HITT directly interacts with ATM at the HEAT repeat domain, blocking MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex–dependent ATM recruitment, leading to restrained homologous recombination repair and enhanced chemosensitization. Following DSBs, HITT is elevated mainly by the activation of Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1), resulting in retarded and restricted ATM activation. A reverse association between HITT and ATM activity was also detected in human colon cancer tissues. Furthermore, HITTs sensitize DNA damaging agent–induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo. These findings connect lncRNA directly to ATM activity regulation and reveal potential roles for HITT in sensitizing cancers to genotoxic treatment.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nCells are inevitably challenged by endogenous or exogenous sources of DNA damage [1]. To preserve genetic integrity, organisms have evolved elegant mechanisms to cope with various forms of DNA damage, collectively known as the DNA damage response (DDR) [2]. Deficiency in the DDR is associated with genomic instability, predisposition to cancer, or cell death in cases when damage is irreparable [3]. DNA damage also represents the backbone of cancer treatment. In this context, activation of DNA damage repair pathways promotes genotoxic resistance, which remains a major obstacle in successful cancer treatment [4,5]. Thus, unveiling the mechanisms underlying the DDR may not only inform our knowledge of tumorigenesis but also provide predictive markers for the patients’ responses to therapeutic DNA damage and offer new opportunities for the improvement of treatment efficiency.\n\nDouble-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most toxic DNA lesion that can arise following ionizing radiation (IR) or DNA-based chemotherapy [4]. Cells utilize two prominent pathways to repair DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) [6]. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (ATM) is an apical kinase of phosphorylation cascades in the HR pathway, at the heart of the cellular response to DSBs [7]. One of the most striking features of patients with A-T, a disorder caused by somatic ATM mutation, is their sensitivity to IR and DNA-damaging agents that induce DSBs [8]. Conversely, activation of ATM is linked to the survival of cancer cells following therapy [9,10]. ATM is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Several highly selective small molecule inhibitors of ATM have entered clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers [11,12].\n\nGiven its physiological and pathological significance, the regulation of ATM activity remains a major focus of the field. The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex is vital for the ATM-dependent DDR [13,14]. MRN is the first complex to be recruited to DSB sites, where it provides a platform for ATM recruitment and facilitates the autophosphorylation of ATM at serine (S) 1981, leading to optimal ATM activation that subsequently triggers the phosphorylation of a variety of ATM effectors essential for the DDR, such as checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) and Breast Cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) [15]. Interestingly, mutations in MRN component genes Meiotic Recombination 11 (Mre11) or Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome 1 (NBS1), which are linked to A-T-like disorder and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, respectively, are accompanied by defective ATM activity with symptoms resembling those of A-T patients [16,17], suggesting that MRN is required for the activation of ATM in vivo.\n\nMRN is clearly involved in ATM activation at DSBs; however, how it activates this is still not fully understood. In addition, it has recently become apparent that multiple layers of regulation exist to ensure that the ATM signal is accurate and restricted to appropriate cellular contexts. For example, posttranslational modifications of MRN components, such as NBS1 ubiquitination [18] or MRE11 UFMylation [19], promote MRN-mediated ATM recruitment to DSB sites and thus play important roles in initiating or amplifying the ATM signal. It has also been noted that the rise and fall of ATM activity are equally important for the proper execution of DSB repair [6,20,21]. However, compared with the mechanisms of ATM activation, much less is known about the mechanisms of ATM inhibition.\n\nTo complicate the matter, evidence is steadily accumulating that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of transcribed RNA molecules greater than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length with extremely limited protein-coding capabilities, play essential roles in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes [22,23]. Interestingly, lncRNA integrates contextual and environmental cues not only during development but also under multiple stresses [24]. A variety of lncRNAs are DNA damage responsive and able to modulate the DNA repair program in turn, which highlights the essential roles of lncRNAs in the DDR. For example, lncRNAs DINO (Damage Induced Noncoding) [25], PANDA (P21 associated ncRNA DNA damage activated) [26], and linc-p21 [27] are induced upon DNA damage and are engaged in a feedback loop to regulate apoptosis or DNA repair by modulating p53 protein stability or p53’s transcriptional activity. However, despite being a master regulator of the DDR, whether and how ATM activation is directly regulated by lncRNAs remains to be determined.\n\nWe recently identified an lncRNA, linc00637, which is a 2,056-nt intergenic lncRNA containing three exons mapped at 14q32, a chromosome region that has been associated with the early onset and metastatic recurrence of colon cancer and many other types of cancers [28–30]. We found that linc00637 is down-regulated in multiple types of cancers. Further functional studies reveal that it is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA, whose expression is reduced in the face of hypoxic stress and which plays essential roles in inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), mainly by repressing its translation; thus, we named it HITT (HIF-1α inhibitor at translation level) [31]. Besides hypoxia, cancer cells are also constantly insulted by DNA damage, particularly when receiving conventional genotoxic treatments. Thus, we wondered whether HITT is a stress responsive gene that plays roles in regulating the DDR. To this end, we explored the expression, function, and mechanisms of HITT upon DSBs. Interestingly, we identify HITT as a physiological brake of ATM activation, which is induced and maintained at high levels after DSBs and contributes to the promoted chemosensitization. Mechanistically, HITT is physiologically associated with ATM protein, thereby blocking MRN-mediated ATM recruitment. Thus, HITT represents the first RNA molecule that is directly involved in ATM regulation and may be a potential treatment for anticancer chemosensitization.\n\nResults\n\nDSB-induced HITT expression represses HR repair\n\nTo understand whether HITT is a DNA damage-responsive lncRNA, expression levels of HITT were measured after exposing HCT116 cells to a panel of cytotoxic agents. HITT was significantly increased by drugs that have been reported to induce DSBs, such as doxorubicin (Dox), etoposide (Eto), the radiomimetic compound bleomycin (Bleo), and calicheamicin (CLA) [32–34], but not DSB-independent pro-death treatments, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/cycloheximide (CHX) and taxol, although similar death rates were induced (Fig 1A). In addition, the induction of HITT was dose-dependent with an approximately 5- to 7-fold increase at 4 μg/ml Dox in both HeLa and HCT116 cells (Fig 1B). Time-course analysis revealed that HITT was increased with prolonged Dox treatment and reached a plateau after 2 h (Fig 1C). Similar time- or dose-dependent HITT expression patterns were detected after CLA, Eto, and Bleo exposure (S1A and S1B Fig). Furthermore, DSB-induced HITT expression occurred in a panel of cancer cells with different tissue origins, regardless of p53 status (S1C and S1D Fig). Therefore, DSB-induced HITT up-regulation is likely a common phenomenon that is independent of p53.\n\nThis inspired us to investigate whether HITT plays roles in regulating DSB repair progress. In a DNA comet assay, significant increases in comet tail scores were detected after Dox treatment, and this damage was rapidly repaired in a time-dependent manner after washing out of Dox (Figs 1D, 1E and S1E). Interestingly, stable HITT transfectants markedly attenuated the DDR process (Figs 1D and S1E). Two independent small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specifically targeting HITT reduced HITT expression by approximately 50%. Accordingly, DNA repair progress was significantly accelerated (Figs 1E and S1E).\n\nHR and NHEJ are two prominent pathways in regulating DSB repair. Thus, the efficiencies of HR and NHEJ were further compared after HITT overexpression or knockdown (KD) using cell lines containing the indicated integrated green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters upon I-SceI-induced breaks [35]. RAD51 [36] and X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 4 (XRCC4) [37] are key regulators of HR and NHEJ pathways, respectively. siRNA-mediated RAD51 and XRCC4 KD, respectively, reduced HR and NHEJ as expected (S1F Fig). Under such conditions, we found that HITT overexpression markedly inhibited HR, as indicated by Direct Repeat (DR)-GFP, but not NHEJ, as indicated by EJ2- and EJ5-GFP (Fig 1F and 1G). HITT KD by two independent siRNAs constantly and significantly increased HR but not NHEJ (Fig 1F and 1G). These data demonstrate that HITT is up-regulated upon DSBs independently of p53 and plays important roles in restraining HR repair.\n\nHITT reduces HR repair by repressing ATM activation\n\nWe next sought to understand the mechanisms by which HITT impairs HR. ATM activation is needed for the initiation of DSB repair by HR [38]. In line with this widely accepted notion, two independent ATM inhibitors (ATMi), KU-60019 (ATMi-1) and KU-55933 (ATMi-2), significantly reduced DNA repair in general (Fig 2A) and HR (Fig 1F). Interestingly, HITT completely lost its ability to regulate HR repair in the presence of ATMi (Figs 1F and 2A). ATMi had no obvious impacts on HITT expression levels (S2A Fig). In addition, it has been recently proposed that ATM inhibits HR by repressing DNA resection [39]. In line with this idea, we found that HITT inhibits DNA resection in an ATM activity–dependent manner by assessing the accumulation of RPA2 into nuclear foci, a well-established resection marker [40] (S2B Fig). Therefore, we reasoned that HITT inhibits DSB repair by interfering with HR through blocking ATM-dependent pathways.\n\nTo this end, the activity of ATM, as indicated by the autophosphorylation of ATM at S1981 and the phosphorylation of the well-documented ATM target Chk2, was first compared in control and HITT overexpression cells. The specificity of anti-p-ATM antibody was verified by treating cells with ATMi (S2C Fig). p-ATM and p-Chk2 were induced after Dox treatment, which was largely abolished in HITT overexpression in a HITT dose-dependent manner (Figs 2B and S2D). In contrast, HITT KD mediated by two independent HITT siRNAs or HITT CRISPR/Cas9 elevated Dox-induced p-ATM and p-Chk2 (Figs 2C and S2E). The effect of HITT on ATM activity was also validated by detecting the expression levels of another ATM substrate γ-H2A.X (Fig 2B and 2C). Inhibition of HITT in HITT overexpression cells rescued Dox-induced p-ATM and p-Chk2 (S2F Fig). Neither HITT expression nor KD affected total protein levels of ATM and Chk2 (Fig 2B and 2C). In contrast to ATM, the activation of another phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related protein kinase family member, Ataxia Telangiectasia And Rad3-Related Protein (ATR), did not change with HITT expression (Fig 2B and 2C). Therefore, HITT specifically inhibits ATM activity.\n\nA time-course experiment was further performed. A mild induction of p-ATM occurred as early as 5 min after Dox treatment and kept rising in a time-dependent manner with the prolonged treatment, reaching plateau 2 h after treatment (Fig 2D), whereas HITT was increased relative late, 1 h after Dox treatment (S3A Fig). Dynamic induction of p-ATM was significantly delayed and attenuated by HITT overexpression (Fig 2D) and accelerated and elevated by HITT KD (Fig 2E).\n\nIt is also noteworthy that inhibition of HITT-mediated ATM activation was not specific to cell type or p53 status, with similar phenomena observed in p53 null H1299 and SW620 cells (S3B Fig). Similar to what was observed upon Dox treatment, HITT-inhibited ATM activation was further confirmed in Bleo-treated HeLa and HCT116 cells (S3C and S3D Fig) and Eto-treated HeLa cells (S3E Fig). Therefore, HITT restrains p-ATM upon DSBs, and it is a common phenomenon independent of p53 status.\n\nIt is known that HR is more prevalent after DNA replication [6]; however, HITT expression was not related to cell cycle (S3F Fig). HITT overexpression did not alter the levels of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (S3G Fig) or cell-cycle distribution under basal conditions (S3H Fig), suggesting that HITT suppresses HR by affecting signaling in HR pathway per se, rather than by arresting the cell cycle. Despite detecting delayed entrance into S and G2/M phases in HITT overexpression cells upon Dox treatment compared with control cells, ATMi completely abolished this effect (S3H Fig). Thus, we deduced that the retarded S and G2/M phase entrance in HITT overexpression cells was due to decreased ATM activation, which is consistent with previous reports that ATM regulates cell-cycle progression [41].\n\nThese data collectively suggest that HITT is an important inhibitor of ATM activation and therefore plays essential roles in attenuating HR repair upon DSBs.\n\nHITT inhibits MRN-mediated ATM recruitment to the DSB sites\n\nWe next investigated the underlying mechanisms by which HITT inhibits ATM activity. MRN is a sensor of DSBs and integral to ATM-dependent DNA repair signaling [42]. NBS1 is an MRN component that plays key roles to recruit ATM to the DSB sites. As expected, NBS1 KD reduced ATM activity. Interestingly, despite no obvious impacts on HITT levels (S4A Fig), NBS1 KD completely abolished the effect of HITT on ATM activity (Fig 3A). These data suggest that HITT inhibition of ATM is dependent on MRN action. However, neither HITT overexpression nor KD produced a significant impact on MRN proteins (Fig 2B and 2C). In addition, cell-staining and chromatin fractionation assays revealed that HITT does not influence the formation of nuclear foci by NBS1 (Fig 3B) and RAD50 (S4B Fig) or the association of MRN components (NBS1 and RAD50) with chromatin (S4C Fig). In contrast, DNA damage–induced p-ATM foci were barely detectable in HITT overexpression HeLa cells (Figs 3B and S4B). In agreement, the chromatin-associated ATM was decreased with HITT overexpression and increased with HITT KD, whereas the association of chromatin with ATR was not affected by either HITT expression or KD (S4C Fig). These data suggest that HITT may inhibit ATM activation by regulating MRN-mediated ATM recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Indeed, a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay revealed that the association of p-ATM or ATM with NBS1, a key component of MRN that has been reported to be directly associated with ATM [43], was detected and was dramatically decreased upon ectopic HITT expression; however, the association of NBS1 with another MRN component, RAD50, remained unaffected (Fig 3C). Therefore, HITT appears to specifically interfere with the association of ATM with MRN upon DSBs.\n\nHITT is physically associated with ATM at an essential NBS1-binding site\n\nWe next asked how HITT inhibits the association between ATM and NBS1. lncRNA may act by interacting with proteins. We have previously shown that HITT is distributed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus [31] and therefore wondered whether HITT binds with ATM or MRN. To this end, an in vitro RNA-binding assay was first applied. As shown, the assay revealed that ATM coprecipitated with Biotin-HITT but not Biotin-antisense-HITT (Fig 3D), whereas none of the MRN components bound with HITT or antisense-HITT (Fig 3D). UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is standard in RNA research used to determine the direct interactions between proteins and nucleic acids. As revealed by CLIP assay, HITT was present in ATM, but not immunoglobulin G (IgG) or RAD50, immunoprecipitates (Fig 3E). The association between ATM and HITT was not only significantly enhanced with ectopic HITT expression but also increased with Dox treatment (Fig 3E and 3F). These data suggest that HITT is physically and specifically associated with ATM, which may be biologically significant in regulating the DDR.\n\nWe further investigated what the molecular mechanism by which HITT binds with ATM is. HITT does not have a homolog in mice, which thus provides a convenient tool to map the HITT sequence that contributes to its association with ATM, without interference from endogenous HITT. Different HITT fragments (F) were generated and similar levels of HITT were introduced into the mouse cell line 4T1. CLIP of endogenous ATM revealed that comparable rates of FL and F3 were present in ATM immunoprecipitates, whereas F1 and F2 were unlikely to contribute to the interaction (Fig 3G). The binding sites within F3 were further narrowed down to F3–1 (1,030–1,247 bp) (Fig 3G). In line with this result, we found that F3 (F3–1), but not the other fragments, inhibited ATM activity (Fig 3H). Full-length HITT and F3 elicits similar effect in inhibiting HR efficiency (Fig 3I).\n\nWe also examined which domain in ATM contributes to the interaction with HITT. To answer this question, we generated different ATM truncations as indicated in Fig 3I. ATM mutant types (MTs) that lost the MT3 sequence within the HEAT repeat domain failed to bind with HITT (Fig 3J). The direct interaction between HITT and ATM-MT3 was further verified by in vitro RNA pull-down assay using in vitro–translated ATM-MT3 protein and in vitro–synthesized sense-HITT (Fig 3K). Interestingly, MT3 has been identified to be an essential NBS1-binding site [43], suggesting HITT may mask the NBS1-binding sites, leading to the repressed association between ATM and NBS1. In agreement, we found that NBS1 bound with MT2 and MT3, which contain NBS1-binding domain, but not with MT4. Such interaction was dramatically reduced in cells overexpressing HITT compared with control cells (Fig 3L).\n\nIt is thus logical to propose that HITT binds the NBS1-binding site in ATM (MT3) via F3–1 (1,030–1,247 bp) and prevents NBS1-mediated ATM recruitment to DSBs.\n\nHITT is transcriptionally activated by the induction of EGR1 upon DSBs\n\nConsidering the functional significance of HITT in regulating the response to DSBs, we next explored the underlying mechanisms of HITT up-regulation in response to chemotherapeutic treatment. Actinomycin D, an RNA synthesis inhibitor, completely abolished Dox-induced HITT expression, suggesting that HITT up-regulation is not due to RNA stabilization (S5A Fig). Interestingly, an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase of HITT luciferase activity was detected after Dox treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4A), which was similar to the extent of HITT induction, suggesting that the up-regulation of HITT is predominately due to the promoted RNA synthesis.\n\nBy searching potential binding motifs of transcription factors located at promoter regions of HITT in the UCSC Genome Browser chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq) database, the most potent transcription factors were Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) and TATA-box binding protein associated factor 1 (TAF1) (S5B Fig), both of which have been implicated in the DDR previously [44,45]. However, the expression of EGR1, but not TAF1, was found to be elevated by Dox (Figs 4B and S5C); thus, EGR1 was subjected to the further analysis. As shown, induction of EGR1 appeared 1 h after Dox treatment, was further elevated with prolonged incubation until 6 h (Fig 4B). EGR1 by specific siRNAs abrogated Dox-induced HITT luciferase reporter activity and HITT expression (Fig 4C). These data support the idea that EGR1 is required for Dox-induced HITT transcription.\n\nWe further investigated whether HITT is a direct target of EGR1. First of all, we found that transfection with increasing doses of EGR1-expressing plasmids led to increasing HITT expression (S5D Fig). Two independent siRNAs specifically targeting EGR1 diminished the expression of the target and also reduced HITT expression (S5E Fig). Additionally, consistent with bioinformatics prediction, the MT1 reporter, which did not have the predicted EGR1-binding sites, failed to respond to EGR1 expression (Fig 4D). In contrast, the activity of the MT2 mutant reporter was as effective as the wild-type reporter in response to EGR1 (Fig 4D). A ChIP assay further revealed that EGR1 was associated with the HITT promoter at the corresponding sites, and such interaction was significantly promoted by Dox (Fig 4E). Therefore, HITT is a direct target of EGR1, which is critical for maintaining high levels of HITT after exposure to DNA damage. In line with this notion, siRNA-mediated EGR1 KD abolished Dox-induced HITT expression and facilitated ATM activation (Figs 4F and S5F).\n\nCollectively, EGR1 is required for HITT induction upon DSBs.\n\nHITT down-regulation may contribute to ATM activation in vivo in human colon cancers\n\nGiven the significance of HITT in regulating ATM’s activity, we further investigated their association in vivo in human colon cancers. HITT levels were commonly decreased in colon cancer tissues to approximately 32% of their paired adjacent normal controls (n = 40 pairs, S6A Fig). p-ATM was increased in 27 out of 40 colon cancer tissues when compared with their matched controls (S6B and S6C Fig), whereas total ATM was not changed in cancer (S6D Fig). Although NBS1 levels were also increased in a subset of colon cancer tissues (29/40, S6E Fig), no significant association between NBS1 overexpression and p-ATM enhancement was observed (S6F Fig). Interestingly, the fold of p-ATM induction was significantly higher in the lower HITT expression group than in the higher expression group (S6G Fig). p-ATR level, also an indicator of DNA damage, was increased in colon cancers, whereas it was not related to HITT fold-change (S6B, S6H, S6I and S6J Fig). These clinical data, combined with those of our in vitro studies, suggest that HITT down-regulation may contribute to the activation of ATM in vivo.\n\nHITT sensitizes Dox-induced apoptosis by inhibiting ATM activation both in vitro and in vivo\n\nMany chemotherapeutic drugs remove cancer cells by inducing severe DNA damage. The activation of ATM and the subsequent DNA damage repair can limit the effectiveness of DNA-damaging reagents [32]. Considering the important function of HITT in regulating ATM activity and the DDR, its effects on chemotherapy-induced cell death were explored using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Our results show that cell viability was reduced by Dox in a much more dramatic manner in HITT stable lines than in corresponding vector controls (Fig 5A), whereas HITT KD dramatically alleviated Dox’s inhibitory effect on cell viability (Fig 5B). ATMi-1/2 reduced cell viability in the presence of Dox and also completely abolished the impact of HITT (Fig 5A and 5B). Supportively, HITT F3, which is shown to contribute to ATM activity and HR inhibition, produced similar effect to increase Dox-induced cell death (S7A Fig). Under unstressed basal conditions, HITT had no obvious effect on clonal number and size when cells were grown on soft agar, whereas Dox treatment produced a much more dramatic effect on the inhibition of clonal growth in HITT-overexpressing cells than in controls (Fig 5C). Furthermore, HITT significantly elevated apoptosis rates, as indicated by Annexin V–positive staining and cleaved caspase 3/7 after Dox treatment in both HeLa and HCT116 cells (Fig 5D and 5E). The effects of HITT on clonal formation and apoptosis were completely abolished by ATMi (Fig 5C and 5E). KD HITT regulators, EGR1, inhibited Dox-induced apoptosis (Fig 5F and 5G). Similar results were obtained in Bleo- and Eto-treated HCT116 and HeLa cells (S7B–S7E Fig) and Dox-treated p53-null H1299 cells (S7F and S7G Fig). These data collectively suggest that HITT facilitates DNA damaging agent–induced apoptosis by inhibiting ATM in a p53-independent manner.\n\nThe impact of HITT on the effect of Dox was also evaluated in vivo using a nude mice xenograft model. To avoid big initial tumor volume differences on HITT overexpression and control xenografts before Dox treatment, more HITT-overexpressing HCT116 cells than vector controls were inoculated into nude mice. The mice with similar tumor volumes (about 200 mm3) were subjected to the indicated treatments (n = 6 for each group). Even more HCT116/HITT cells were injected, with the growth rates of HITT xenografts still slightly lower than those of vector controls (Fig 6A–6C). Dox treatment only slightly reduced tumor growth in the vector control xenografts, and no statistical significance was obtained in comparison with the untreated vector controls (Fig 6A–6C). Remarkably, Dox reduced tumor weight by approximately 4-fold in HITT overexpression xenografts compared with vector xenografts (Fig 6A and 6B). Furthermore, ATMi-1, which has been tested in preclinical [46], produced a mild inhibitory effect on tumor growth (Fig 6A–6C). Consistent with previous reports, the effect of ATMi-1 was more evident when combined with the DNA-damaging agent Dox. Interestingly, no synergistic effect was observed with the combination of HITT overexpression and ATMi-1 (Fig 6A–6C), which further supports the idea that HITT inhibits tumor growth by preventing the activation of ATM. Dox treatment led to a mild decrease of body weight in mice (Fig 6D).\n\nIn agreement with the in vitro data, HITT was elevated by Dox in vivo (Fig 6E). Western blot (WB) assays revealed that ATM activity was increased by Dox and was diminished by HITT (Fig 6F). ATMi-1 produced a similar effect with ectopic HITT expression on ATM activity. Neither HITT expression nor ATMi-1 had an obvious effect on the expression of total ATM and MRN components.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDNA repair inhibitors have been developed as clinical agents to reverse radiation or genotoxic drug resistance [32]. Basic research into understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying DNA damage repair is crucial for the identification of tumor markers, to allow for more-effective targeted cancer treatment.\n\nHere, we identify a novel intrinsic inhibitor of ATM activation that is a key and apical event in initiating DDR cascades. Unlike previous reported ATM regulators, this molecule brake is an RNA, namely HITT, that specifically and physiologically binds with ATM. Upon DSBs, HITT expression is elevated and its association with ATM is increased accordingly, thereby retraining MRN-mediated recruitment of ATM to the DNA damage sites and compromising DNA repair mediated by HR (Fig 7). Two independent ATMi completely abrogates HITT’s effect on the DDR program and HR. HITT does not further chemosensitize cells treated with ATMi, supporting the idea that HITT mainly interferes with the same prosurvival signals as ATMi.\n\nOf note, no less important than the activation of the ATM-mediated DDR network is to limit its activation after DNA damage repair. This process may also be complex and highly structured. The mechanisms underlying ATM inhibition have emerged recently. It has been shown that H1.2 and Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) attenuate ATM activation by directly interacting with ATM [47] or by indirect mechanisms involving E2F1 [48]. Notably, HITT expression is elevated 1 h after Dox treatment, which is later than ATM activation is detected (5 min). It is reasonable to propose that cells limit ATM from overactivation by enhancing HITT after DNA damage repair. HITT may represent an important brake in controlling the ATM-mediated DDR network, which is a key cell fate determinant, particularly upon prolonged exposure to DNA-damaging agents in cancer treatment. We also made an interesting observation that HITT binds with ATM under basal conditions (Fig 7), suggesting that it may provide quality control to counteract toxic HR. Indeed, a deficiency in ATM inhibition has been associated with carcinogenesis, resistance to DNA damage–induced cancer treatment, and loss of mitotic checkpoint [49–51]. It is reasonable to propose that the expression of HITT may alleviate and loss of HITT expression may reinforce such effects. In addition, it has become apparent that ATM is active in response to multiple conditions involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis [7]. It would be interesting to investigate the physiological significance of the newly identified HITT-ATM interaction in a DNA damage–independent context.\n\nMRN is a sensor for cells to recognize DSBs [52]. Recruitment and optimal activation of ATM is mainly dependent on its interaction with the MRN component NBS1 [43]. Consistent with this notion, the mutation of ATM-binding sites in NBS1 completely abrogates ATM accumulation at DSB sites [43]. Interestingly, the regulation of ATM by HITT is MRN(NBS1)-dependent. We further defined the ATM site that facilitates HITT binding to a previously identified NBS1-binding site (the HEAT repeats domain), raising the possibility that HITT competes with NBS1 in binding with ATM. Indeed, ectopic HITT expression led to increased association of HITT/ATM and reduced association of NBS1/ATM, without influencing total ATM or NBS1 protein levels. Also notably, NBS1 is essential to induce ATM monomerization and activation [13,53]. HITT and NBS1 bind with ATM at the same sites, although eliciting opposite effects on ATM activity. It remains to be investigated whether HITT plays roles in influencing ATM monomerization and, if so, whether such activity of HITT is dependent on its inhibitory effect on NBS1/ATM interaction.\n\nNotably, lncRNA is normally expressed at lower levels than protein-coding genes [54]. One potential explanation for the robust effect of HITT on ATM activity is that HITT may transiently interact with ATM to modulate ATM modification to render it inactive. Indeed, it has been reported that ATM modification may influence its activation [20,55]. In addition, although HITT itself may have no catalytic activity, its effect on ATM downstream signaling can be amplified and is not necessarily linearly associated with its expression levels. It will be interesting to test the above models in future studies.\n\nWe also suggest that HITT’s inhibition of ATM may be of clinical significance. A small peptide containing the evolutionarily conserved region of NBS1, which binds with ATM, disrupts the interaction between NBS1 and ATM. This peptide also prevents DNA damage signaling and radiosensitization of cells, underscoring the notion that blocking the NBS1/ATM interaction is a potential target for anticancer treatment [56]. Indeed, we found that HITT-mediated ATM inhibition leads to increased cell death when cells are treated with Dox both in vitro and in vivo. Because of its significant effects regarding improving chemosensitivity, our data encourage the future development of lncRNA-based cancer therapies for patients resistant to genotoxic treatments.\n\nFurthermore, p53 is an important gene in regulating genome stability and the DDR [57]. However, we made an interesting observation that the induction of HITT upon DSB- and HITT-dependent DDR activity is p53-independent. This is important, as p53 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers [58]. The discovery of a p53-independent function of HITT implies that HITT could be utilized to sensitize cells to cytotoxic drug treatments that are applicable to a wide range of human cancers, regardless of their p53 status.\n\nMoreover, HITT expression is commonly decreased, whereas p-ATM levels are increased, in colon cancer tissues. Despite being elevated in a subset of cancer samples, NBS1 overexpression is not likely to be important for ATM activation, which suggests that additional layers of regulation exist for NBS1-mediated ATM activation. Importantly, the extent of the reduction of HITT expression is significantly associated with increasing p-ATM, which suggests that HITT down-regulation may contribute to the activation of p-ATM in vivo. This is important, because ATM activation has been associated with treatment failure in multiple cancers. Detection of ATM variance or its protein expression has been suggested to be a potential predictive marker for drug response [5], and our findings provide an effective marker, HITT, for the prediction of ATM activity. In addition, BRCA1- and BRCA2-mutated cells are defective in HR repair and are thus highly sensitive to poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor treatment [12]. In addition, ATM deficiency has been shown to increase sensitivity to PARP and ATR inhibitors [59]. HITT specifically inhibits the ATM-dependent HR pathway. The synergistic effects of HITT and PARP inhibitors warrant future investigation. ATMi has also been shown to be a promising single agent for the treatment of human cancers with defects in particular oncogene signals, such as a loss of PTEN (phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromosome ten) [60]. Further work is thus necessary to decipher whether HITT could be applied alone in subtypes of cancers.\n\nWe have also found that Dox-induced HITT up-regulation is predominately controlled by EGR1. EGR1 can be rapidly up-regulated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli, including the activation of growth and differentiation signals, tissue injury, and apoptotic signals, such as IR. Despite its transient activation, the expression of EGR1 is likely required for HITT up-regulation, since EGR1 KD completely abolishes Dox-induced HITT. These data are consistent with the fact that HITT is involved in regulating the initiation steps of the DDR. In addition, EGR1 KD is accompanied by impaired DDR and p53 activation [61]. Here, we provide the first evidence that EGR1 exerts its effect on the DDR by modulating lncRNA expression. However, HITT is maintained at high levels, even when EGR1 expression drops back down to unstressed levels, suggesting that additional transcriptional regulation of HITT also exists. Indeed, a number of additional transcription factors have been indicated to bind with HITT promoter as shown in UCSC Genome Browser ChIP-seq database. It will be interesting to investigate the impacts of these candidate transcription factors on HITT expression in the context of DSB.\n\nAltogether, our results demonstrate that HITT plays essential roles in inhibiting the HR pathway by restraining ATM activity and thus may be an effective adjuvant therapy for genotoxic or radiomimetic compounds or a predictive marker for treatment efficiency in cancer.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement\n\nHuman colorectal cancer tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal controls (40 pairs) were collected from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University in China.

The total proteins and RNAs were extracted and then subjected to WB and real-time RT-PCR analysis.\n\nIn vivo xenograft mouse study\n\nHITT expression was stably restored in HCT116 cells, by using empty vector as a control. The female nude mice between 4 and 5 wk old were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience. To avoid the initial big volume difference between the HITT overexpression and control groups, the 1 × 107 vector cells and 1.5 × 107 HITT stable HCT116 cells were inoculated subcutaneously. The tumor volumes were measured every week and calculated as length × width2 × 0.5. When the tumor volume reached about 200 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into four groups and subjected to the treatment of DMSO and Dox alone (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) once per week for 2 wk or in combination with ATMi-1 (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) daily for 5 d (n = 6 for each group). The tumor size and the body weights of the mice were measured every 2 d. After treatment for 2 wk, the mice were anesthetized and culled. The tumor was carefully removed, photographed, and weighed.\n\nWB assay\n\nCells or tissue specimens were lysed in UREA buffer (8 M Urea, 1 M Thiourea, 0.5% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, and 24 mM Spermine).

GFP signal was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS).\n\nChIP\n\nCells were incubated with formaldehyde to yield protein-DNA cross-link complexes, which were purified and sheared by sonication. The chromatin was divided equally into two groups for further IP reaction with anti-EGR1 antibody or IgG control. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and then incubated at 65°C to reverse the protein-DNA cross-linking. The DNA was extracted by the Axygen product purification kit and subjected to PCR analysis.\n\nCLIP\n\nUV-irradiated cells were collected in lysis buffer (5 mM PIPES [pH 8.0], 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40 and 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1]) and supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher). The cell lysates were precleaned with protein G sepharose beads and then incubated with the indicated antibodies or IgG control, rotating at 4°C overnight. The antibody-RNA complexes were collected. The immunoprecipitated RNA was eluted and extracted for further real-time RT-PCR analysis.\n\nIn vitro RNA pull-down assay\n\nBiotin-labeled HITT and its antisense were in vitro synthesized by Biotin RNA Labeling Mix (Roche, 11685597910). After treatment with RNase-free DNase I, secondary structure of Biotin-labeled RNA was recovered and incubated with streptavidin agarose beads (Invitrogen) overnight. The fresh cell lysates or in vitro–translated protein (TNT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega) were collected and incubated with RNA-captured beads at 4°C for 1 h. The associated proteins were detected by WB.\n\nClonogenic survival assay\n\nHITT stable HeLa cells were treated with Dox (1 μg/ml) with or without Ku60019 (10 μM) or Ku55933 (10 μM) for 24 h. The untreated and the treated cells were trypsinized and subjected to a typical clonogenic survival assay. A total of 5 × 104 cells were mixed with 2×DMEM medium with 20% FBS containing 0.7% agar and then spread on the top of a bottom agar layer (1% agar in drug-free DMEM full growth medium) in a 6-well plate. DMEM medium (2 mL) was added and refreshed every 3–4 d. Cells were grown for 1 mo. Colonies were counted and photographed after stained with 1% Crystal Violet.

As brief, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,300g for 4 min, and the remaining pellet (enriched with nuclei) was washed with buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) once and then lysed in buffer B (3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT) on ice for 5 min. The nuclei lysate was then centrifuged at 1,700g for 4 min and the supernatant (soluble nuclear fraction) was removed. The final pellet is the chromatin fraction that is ready for further analysis.\n\nMTT assay\n\nCell viabilities after the treatment were assessed by the colorimetric MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) assay. The absorbance was measured with a spectrometer at 490 nm. Each experiment was conducted in triplicates and repeated independently for three times.\n\nCell-cycle synchronization assay\n\nTo synchronize the cell cultures, HeLa cells were exposed to 2.5 mM TdR (Sigma) for 16 h (first block) and then placed on fresh medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 12 h (first release). After that, cells were subjected to another round of TdR treatment (second block) before incubation with fresh medium for an additional 0, 6, 8, and 10.5 h, respectively. The cells were collected at different time points for cell-cycle analysis by flow cytometer, and HITT expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining and BrdU incorporation assay\n\nCells grown on cover slips in a 24-well plate were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution on ice for 4 min. Cells were then blocked by 3% BSA for 1 h followed by the antibody incubation at 4°C overnight. After that, cells were washed 3 × 5 min in PBS and then incubated with the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody for 1 h. DAPI was stained for 3 min for visualizing the nucleus. The slices were mounted by 90% glycerinum and images were captured by a Zeiss Axio Observer confocal microscope.\n\nBrdU (Sigma, #B5002) incorporation assay was carried out by following the protocol provided by Cell Signaling Technology. Briefly, BrdU was diluted to a final concentration of 0.03 mg/mL with fresh DMEM and then applied onto the cells grown on slices. Cells were incubated with 1.5 M HCl followed by 5-min fixation in 70% cold ethanol. Immunostained with anti-BrdU antibody was then conducted as shown above. The antibody dilution ratio are as follows: p-ATM (#Ab81292, 1:100), p-ATM (10H11.E12) (#NB100-306, 1:1,000), NBS1 (#Ab32074, 1:100), RAD50 (#Ab89, 1:100), RPA2 (#10412-1-AP, 1:200), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H&amp;L (Alexa Fluor 488) (#Ab150113, 1:400), and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&amp;L (Alexa Fluor 647) (#Ab150079, 1:400).\n\nTrypan blue staining\n\nAfter different drug treatment for 24 h, both survival and dead cells were collected and subjected to trypan blue staining and counted by hemocytometer.
