PLoS Biol 5(11): e300. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050300\n\nThere was an error in the last line of the legend for Figure 4C. It should read “…ISI, the interspike interval in milliseconds…”\n\nThere were also several errors in the final paragraph of the Materials and Methods section. Lines 6 and 7 should read:\n\n“Pipette resistance was 6–9 MΩ. Access resistance was 12–30 MΩ, not compensated and regularly monitored during recordings.”"
