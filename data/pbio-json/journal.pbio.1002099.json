  "fullText": "It has come to the authors’ attention that there are errors in Fig. 3 and in Fig. 8. In Fig. 3A and B, the dotted lines in the D2 response ‘heat maps’ were inadvertently missing and have now been added. Additionally, the x-axis gridlines have been removed. In the lower half of Fig. 8D, the color of the SB line has been adjusted from black to blue, and the line for SA under reacquisition has been adjusted from dark blue to light blue. The corrected versions are provided below."
