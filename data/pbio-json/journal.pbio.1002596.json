  "fullText": "Notice of republication\n\nDue to the publication of copyrighted material, this article has been republished in order to remove dual published content from the published record. Please see below for full details.\n\nThe authors would like to make the following corrections to four of the published figures–Figs 1, 3, 5 and 6. The editors have verified all relevant original data and also confirm that the manuscript’s original conclusions are not affected. The authors apologize for these errors caused by mislabelling and inadvertent duplication during initial manuscript preparation. All authors have seen and approved this republication.\n\nCorrections to Fig 1\n\nThe originally published version of Fig 1C included a Tubulin (crypt-villus) panel had been previously published in Fig 1A of a publication in another journal (The EMBO Journal (2009) 28, 3329–3340). Both panels are correct, but we are re-publishing Fig 1 in this PLOS Biology article to include a replicate of the Tubulin (crypt-villus) panel in Fig 1C to avoid issues of copyrighted dual publication. The corrected Fig 1 file is provided.\n\nCorrections to Fig 3\n\nThe published Fig 3A MLLT10 bands are incorrect; an MLLT10 panel from Fig 4B was accidentally duplicated in its place. The correct MLLT10 bands are now provided in this revised figure.\n\nThe published Fig 3A TCF4 bands are incorrect; a similar-looking beta-catenin panel from Fig 1B was accidentally duplicated in its place. The correct TCF4 bands are now provided in this revised figure.\n\nThe published Fig 3B Tubulin panel is incorrect; a similar-looking Tubulin panel from Fig 1A was accidentally duplicated in its place. The correct Tubulin bands are now provided in this revised figure.\n\nThe published Fig 3B MLLT10 panel is incorrect; a DOT1L panel from a beta-catenin IP experiment in Fig S3A was accidentally duplicated in its place. The correct MLLT10 bands are now provided in this revised figure.\n\nCorrection to Fig 5\n\nFig 5G Tubulin panel (for si con, si DOT1L) is incorrect; a similar-looking DOT1L panel from Fig 4A was accidentally duplicated in its place. The correct Tubulin bands are now provided in this revised figure.\n\nCorrections to Fig 6\n\nThe originally published version of Fig 6A included a beta-catenin (si MLLT10) panel that we had previously published in Fig 5B (as beta-catenin, si TNIK) of a publication in another journal (The EMBO Journal (2009) 28, 3329–3340). The EMBO publication’s panel is correct; this PLOS Biology article’s panel was incorrect. We have now corrected Fig 6 to include the correct beta-catenin (si MLLT10) panel in Fig 6A. We are also re-publishing this corrected Fig 6 to avoid issues of incorrect dual publication. The corrected Fig 6 file is provided."
