  "fullText": "The current published Figure S6C contains lanes from a single gel run that have been rearranged and spliced for the purposes of figure composition. The authors wish to correct Figure S6 to adequately show these splices by the addition of solid splice lines, and by correcting the legend for further clarity. The method of this figure composition does not affect the scientific understanding of the article. A corrected version of this figure, named S6 Fig, in addition to a corrected legend, are provided here.\n\nSupporting Information"
