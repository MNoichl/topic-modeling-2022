  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nIn the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA replication initiation is driven by a sharp rise of Clb5/6-Cdk1 activity [1]–[3]. As the cell passes Start [4],[5], the commitment to the next round of cell division, the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5, is phosphorylated and then excluded from the nucleus [6],[7], and two transcription factor complexes Swi4/Swi6 (SBF) [8] and Mbp1/Swi6 (MBF) [9] are activated. SBF and MBF transcribe about 200 G1/S genes including the G1 cyclins (CLN1 and CLN2) and the S cyclins (CLB5 and CLB6) [10],[11]. Unlike Cln1/2-Cdk1, which is the major driver of cell cycle progression in the late G1 phase by phosphorylating many G1/S targets [12], Clb5/6-Cdk1 is rendered inactive throughout G1 phase by the inhibitor Sic1 until Sic1 is phosphorylated and degraded (Figure 1) [13],[14]. The timing and the speed of Sic1 destruction determine the activation profile of Clb5/6-Cdk1 activity. Strains with either SIC1 deleted or altered Sic1 degradation dynamics show a significant increase in genomic instability (Figure S4), underlining the importance of Sic1 for a proper S-phase entry [15],[16].\n\nSic1 has nine consensus CDK phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylation on multiple sites is required for the SCF ubiquitin ligase F-box protein Cdc4 to efficiently recognize Sic1, thereby targeting it for degradation by the 26S proteasome [14],[15],[17]. Both Cln2-Cdk1 and Clb5-Cdk1 can phosphorylate Sic1 efficiently in vitro [18],[19], and a recent biochemical study suggested the multisite phosphorylation is carried out in a processive cascade fashion [18]. Given the in vitro observation that Cln2-Cdk1 and Clb5-Cdk1 have different specificity on different phosphorylation sites of Sic1, it was proposed that Sic1 is first phosphorylated by Cln2-Cdk1 on a certain site (priming site), facilitating its subsequent phosphorylation by Clb5-Cdk1, eventually leading to its degradation after phosphorylation of the phosphodegrons [18].\n\nHowever, this interpretation is clouded by extensive circumstantial in vivo evidence. Strains lacking CLN1 and CLN2 are highly sensitive to SIC1 gene dosage [20], the DNA replication delay in strains lacking CLN1 and CLN2 is Sic1 dependent [21], premature Clb5 expression from the GAL1 promoter does not advance the onset of S phase [2], and deleting CLB5 and CLB6 does not affect the normal timing of Sic1 turnover [14],[22]. All in vivo observations seem to suggest that it is Cln1/2-Cdk1, but not Clb5/6-Cdk1, who is responsible for the physiological Sic1 destruction. It was even thought that the only nonredundant essential function of the Cln1/2-Cdk1 is to inactivate Sic1 [23]. To date, the only supporting evidence for Clb5/6-Cdk1's contribution to Sic1 destruction in vivo is that Sic1 is stable with B-type cyclin inhibition [18]. However, the same experiment performed by another group earlier reached the opposite conclusion [14]. Therefore, whether or not Clb5/6-Cdk1 phosphorylates Sic1 in vivo remains a mystery.\n\nIn addition, previous studies suggested that the requirement of multisite phosphorylation sets a threshold for CDK activity for the onset of Sic1 degradation, and thus is responsible for a rapid, switch-like destruction of Sic1 [15],[24]. However, a theoretical study showed that while multisite phosphorylation can establish a threshold for kinase activity, the response beyond the threshold is not necessarily switch-like [25]. The same study reported that a switch-like response requires disparities of several orders of magnitude in catalytic efficiencies at different phosphorylation sites. This does not seem to be the case for Sic1 [18].\n\nIn this article, by monitoring Sic1 destruction dynamics directly in single cells and in real time under a variety of systemic and environmental perturbations, we resolve the discrepancies mentioned above and provide a clear picture of the G1/S transition in yeast. We investigate the role various components in the G1/S regulatory circuitry play in Sic1 destruction dynamics and dissect the G1/S switch at the core of this circuitry to reveal its underlying design principles.\n\nResults\n\nClb5/6-Cdk1, Not Cln1/2-Cdk1, Plays the Major Role in Controlling the Speed of Sic1 Destruction in Vivo\n\nTo quantitatively monitor Sic1 degradation dynamics in individual cells and in real time, we tagged the endogenous SIC1 at the C terminus with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and used live-cell fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2B). We verified that Sic1-GFP half-life is the same as the endogenous Sic1 (Figure S1A–C). For each cell, we were able to measure the concentration of Sic1 as a function of time and thereby obtained the half-life of Sic1 by fitting our data to an exponential decay function (Figure 2C, Text S1). We observed considerable cell-to-cell variability in Sic1 half-life (Figure 2F), though there is no systematic difference between mother and daughter cells (Figure 2D,E, Figure S1F, Figure S2F–H, and Table S1).\n\nWe first deleted one by one each of the components in the circuitry that precedes Clb5/6-Cdk1 activation (blue box in Figure 2A). Perturbations on different components led to the various familiar phenotypes: For example, swi4Δ and cln1Δcln2Δ prolonged the cell cycle, whi5Δ had a smaller cell size, and cln1Δcln2Δ delayed budding. However, none of these has a statistically significant effect on Sic1 half-life (Figure 2F; Tables S1 and S2). Surprisingly, even deletion of both CLN1 and CLN2 had no effect on the speed of Sic1 destruction (Figure 2D–F; Tables S1 and S2). These findings suggest that none of these components, including Cln1/2, contributes significantly to the speed and variability of Sic1 destruction. This is in stark contrast with the current model suggested by earlier studies, in which only Cln2-Cdk1 is responsible for switch-like destruction of Sic1 [15],[24].\n\nWe next deleted CLB5 and CLB6. In this case, large effects were observed on both the median and the variability of Sic1 half-life (Figure 2D–F; Tables S1 and S2). The median value increased to τclb5Δ = 6.35 min and τclb5Δclb6Δ = 7.14 min in clb5Δ and clb5Δclb6Δ strains, respectively, compared to τWT = 3.93 min. The variability also increased significantly. These results suggest that Clb5/6-Cdk1 plays a critical role in controlling the speed of Sic1 destruction. The effects of the various gene deletions on Sic1 degradation dynamics were quantitatively captured in a stochastic model of the entire G1/S circuitry (Text S2, Figure 2G, Figure S1G). An important point worth noting is that the slow degradation we observed in clb5Δclb6Δ cells suggests that Cln1/2-Cdk1 mediated phosphorylation does not lead to Sic1's fast destruction. This finding argues against the current model, in which Cln1/2-Cdk1 is solely responsible for rapid destruction of Sic1 [15].\n\nThe result above is in line with the in vitro study that showed that Clb5-Cdk1 is more potent than Cln2-Cdk1 on more phosphorylation sites of Sic1 [18]. Furthermore, it provides direct evidence that a double-negative feedback loop between Clb5/6-Cdk1 and Sic1 is in action (Figure 1 and red box in Figure 2A). Positive feedback loops are capable of generating sharp transitions and are widely implemented in cell fate circuitries [26]–[30]. The observed fast degradation of Sic1 attributed to Clb5/6-Cdk1 can either be due to a higher potency of Clb5/6-Cdk1 on Sic1 phosphorylation or the double-negative feedback loop, or both. Thereby, we next sought to disentangle the contribution of the feedback loop from that of the kinase on Sic1 destruction.\n\nThe Double-Negative Feedback Loop Between Clb5/6-Cdk1 and Sic1 Functions as a Noise Filter to Ensure Robust Fast Destruction of Sic1 in the Face of Genetic and Environmental Perturbations\n\nTo investigate the function of the feedback loop, we constructed a Sic1 reporter, designated Sic1*, by fusing the regulatory domain of Sic1 (including all nine CDK phosphorylation sites) [31] to a fluorescent protein (mCherry) and placing it under the control of the ADH1 constitutive promoter (Figure 3A and 3B). We verified that Sic1* has the same subcellular localization and the same degradation dynamics as the endogenous Sic1 (Figure 3C, Figure S2A) and that Sic1* does not inhibit Clb5/6-Cdk1 (Figure S2B). Thus Sic1* can serve as a reporter of Sic1 destruction dynamics, but due to its lacking of the CDK binding domain, it cannot inhibit Clb5/6-Cdk1.\n\nWith the reporter Sic1*, we were able to study the role of the other components in the feedback loop on Sic1 destruction dynamics (Figure 3A and D–F). Interestingly, unlike the deletion of CLB5/6 (Figure 2F), disabling other components of the double-negative feedback loop resulted in minimal impact on Sic1 degradation speed (compare pairs of data in black and colored dots highlighted by the small rectangles in Figure 3D–F), suggesting that it is Clb5/6-Cdk1, not the feedback loop, that is responsible for Sic1's fast destruction.\n\nHowever, when the cell is subject to genetic or environmental perturbations and stress, we observed a very different behavior: the absence of the loop resulted in large variations in the degradation speed, suggesting that the feedback loop is necessary for robustly fast Sic1 destruction under perturbations (Figure 3D–F, Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7).\n\nThese genetic and environmental perturbations led to noisy transcriptional activities in CLN2 and CLB5 (Figure 3G and 3H, Table S8), and some perturbations increased the cell cycle period more than 2-fold (Figure S2C). (Notably, in the absence of the loop, the degree of the variability in Sic1 half-life reflects the degree of variability in transcriptional activity of CLN2 and CLB5 (Figures 3D–H).) Remarkably, the double-negative feedback loop can buffer the extrinsic noise (cell-to-cell variability) and fluctuations to ensure a robust fast destruction of Sic1.\n\nThe Timing of Sic1 Destruction Is Set by Cln1/2-Cdk1\n\nSo far we have established the important role of Clb5/6-Cdk1 and the double-negative feedback loop in Sic1 destruction. On the other hand, the upstream kinase Cln1/2-Cdk1 can phosphorylate Sic1 in vitro [14] and, presumably, also contributes to Sic1 degradation in vivo as suggested both by previous work [20],[21] and by our experiment with the clb5Δclb6Δ strain. We have shown that Cln1/2-Cdk1 is not essential for Sic1's fast destruction. What is then the in vivo role, if any, of Cln1/2-Cdk1 here? It is known that in cln2Δ strains the onset of the S phase is significantly delayed [21], and recent biochemical study found that Cln2-Cdk1 has a preferred phosphorylation site on Sic1 that could function as a priming site [18].\n\nTo investigate the role of Cln1/2-Cdk1 on Sic1 destruction, we further tagged the transcriptional repressor Whi5 with a red fluorescent protein (mCherry FP), which enabled us to measure the time interval between the Start and the S phase entry. The exclusion of Whi5 from the nucleus marks the point of Start transition at which the transcriptional activity of SBF and MBF is turned on [29]. We define “timing” of Sic1 destruction as the time from Whi5 nuclear exclusion to the point of the fastest Sic1 degradation (Figures 1 and 4B, Figure S3B). Proper timing of Sic1 destruction is essential for a proper S phase entry (Figure S4). We found that the timing of Sic1 destruction was not significantly affected in clb5Δclb6Δ strains. In contrast, it was much more variable in cln1Δcln2Δ strain (Figure 4D and 4E). The median timing was shorter in cln1Δcln2Δ strain, presumably because Clb5/6-Cdk1 significantly contributed to Whi5 nuclear exclusion when Cln1/2-Cdk1 was absent (Figure S3C).\n\nConsidering that the dynamics of Whi5 nuclear exclusion is highly affected in cln1Δcln2Δ strain (due to the absence of the first feedback loop; Figure 4A), rendering our Start reference point unreliable, we further introduced a Sic1 variant with a mutation on the Cln1/2-Cdk1 binding site (Figure 4C). This mutation disables Cln1/2-Cdk1–mediated phosphorylation of Sic1 [18],[32] without deleting CLN1/2, and thus the Whi5 dynamics is unaffected. The destruction timing of this Sic1 mutant was delayed and much more variable than the wild-type (Figure 4E), while the speed of its destruction was as fast as the wild-type (Figure 4F). Taken together, these observations imply that while Clb5/6-Cdk1 is critical for Sic1 fast destruction, Cln1/2-Cdk1 is responsible for setting a robust timing of Sic1 destruction.\n\nTo demonstrate how population-level studies can sometimes be misleading, we averaged the Sic1 concentration profile over many individual cells (Figure 4G). The plot shows an apparent more significant effect of Cln1/2-Cdk1 than Clb5/6-Cdk1 on Sic1 degradation, which is clearly due to the more variable timing of the Cln1/2 mutants. This result explains the discrepancy between our single-cell experiments and the earlier population-level studies that reported that deleting CLB5 and CLB6 does not affect the rate of Sic1 turnover (compare the black and red lines in Figure 4G) [14],[22].\n\nA Multisite Phosphorylation Scheme Is Not Necessary to Achieve Rapid Sic1 Destruction\n\nAn important feature of this circuitry is that Sic1 has to be phosphorylated multiple times before it can be degraded [14],[15],[17]. A study based on Western blotting of Sic1 in synchronized cell populations suggested that the destruction of wild-type Sic1 is more switch-like than a single-phosphosite mutant, Sic1CPD [15]. Sic1CPD lacks all nine endogenous CDK phosphorylation sites of Sic1 but incorporates a single CDK site with a high-affinity Cdc4 binding motif (LLTPP) in place of Ser 76 as shown in Figure 5A [15]. This could imply that the requirement of multisite phosphorylation for Sic1's degradation is responsible for its switch-like destruction [15],[24]. We placed SIC1CPD-GFP at the chromosomal SIC1 locus under the control of the endogenous SIC1 promoter and investigated its destruction dynamics in single cells. We found no obvious difference in half-life between Sic1 and Sic1CPD (Figure 5B and 5C). However, compared to Sic1, a much more variable timing of Sic1CPD destruction was observed (Figure 5D).\n\nConsidering that clb5Δclb6Δ mutations increase the half-life of Sic1 and that Sic1CPD mutant degrades as fast as wild-type, we conclude that Sic1's fast destruction is not a result of a threshold set for Cln1/2-Cdk1 activity by multisite phosphorylation, suggested by the current model [15].\n\nWhen we averaged Sic1 and Sic1CPD concentration profiles over many individual cells, we saw that Sic1CPD does appear to degrade slower, consistent with the earlier population-level study [15]. Our result demonstrates that slow Sic1CPD degradation observed in [15] is mainly due to the large cell-to-cell timing variability of Sic1 degradation (Figure 5E).\n\nDesign Principles of Yeast G1/S Switch\n\nTo further elaborate on the design principles of the G1/S switch and to place our experimental findings on a more general footing, we also carried out a computational study. We constructed an analogous ODE model of the switch consisting of three components (named Kinase1, Kinase2, and Inhibitor) to identify the contributions of the components of the switch to the sharpness and timing of the transition and their respective robustness under cell-to-cell variability on the inputs of the switch (Figures 6A–C) [33]. Essentially, we incorporated extrinsic noise on Kinase1 and Kinase2 production and degradation by varying the synthesis and degradation rates from realization to realization (Text S3). We then optimized the phosphorylation rates to obtain either the sharpest or most timely Kinase2 activation (Figures 6A–C and S5A). We did not incorporate noise in any other reactions and kept the Inhibitor level constant. Note that even though only extrinsic noise was incorporated in this simplified model, the results are applicable to cases where intrinsic noise is also present. (The simplified model is different than the stochastic model of the entire G1/S circuitry, whose results are presented in Figure 2G.)\n\nFirst, we compared the linear circuit (suggested by earlier studies) and the double-negative feedback to discern the roles of multisite phosphorylation and topology on the sharpness of the Inhibitor destruction. We optimized the catalytic efficiencies of the kinases in both circuits to obtain the sharpest Kinase2 activation, as a measure of the decisiveness of the switch (Figure 6D). The double-negative feedback yielded sharper Inhibitor destruction on the average than the linear circuit, confirming that the topology is the dominant factor in determining sharpness and its robustness (i.e., decisiveness), and not multisite phosphorylation.\n\nDouble-negative feedback is more effective in generating sharp Inhibitor destruction [34] because in the linear topology case, speed of degradation is directly affected by the variability in Kinase1 level. The feedback loop ensures that the Inhibitor degradation does not begin before sufficient amount of Kinase2 is accumulated; therefore, it buffers the variability. The disadvantage of the double-negative feedback circuit is that the timing is highly variable for the same reason (last panel in Figure 6D and 6F). The activation occurs when Kinase2 level exceeds the Inhibitor level. The time of the activation varies highly, because Kinase2 approaches to its steady-state level asymptotically, and we assume that the initial level of the Inhibitor and the steady-state level of Kinase2 are comparable, and Kinase2 approaches to that level asymptotically as illustrated in Figure S5D. (The assumption is due to the fact that lower levels of Inhibitor yield timing variabilities that do not match the timing variability of Cln1/2 deletion, as seen in right panel of Figure 6G and Figure S5B.) This is a trade-off that underlies the design of the switch: increasing the Inhibitor level increases the sharpness of the Kinase2 activation and Inhibitor degradation; however, it also increases the variability of the timing (Figure S5D and Figure 6G).\n\nAn interesting fact about the linear circuit is that it generates robust timing, even though it was optimized for sharpness. We next used this insight to see if timing variability of the double-negative feedback loop circuit could be improved by adding an upstream trigger. We picked a double-negative feedback circuit from the sharpness-optimized set (Figure 6D) and attached Kinase1 to it. We then optimized this circuit for timing by only mutating the Kinase1 phosphorylation rates on Inhibitor. Indeed, addition of the trigger reduced the standard deviation of the timing distribution by more than 65% (Figure 6E). This is because Kinase1 enforces timely activation of Kinase2 by initiating Inhibitor degradation (Figure 6F). However, the trade-off is seen here as well—this modification reduced the sharpness of the transition and increased its variability, since Kinase2 activations occurred at a lower level of the Inhibitor on the average. This result is consistent with the Cln2-Cdk1 binding-site mutant of Sic1 that yielded slightly sharper transitions with a lower variability compared to wild-type (Figure 4F). The model predictions qualitatively agree with the clb5Δclb6Δand Cln2-Cdk1 binding-site mutant experiments (Figure S5B).\n\nIn light of the mathematical model, it is clear that Sic1 plays two roles in the G1/S switch by setting a threshold for Clb5/6-Cdk1 activity. First, it prevents precocious activation of Clb5/6-Cdk1. Second, it allows accumulation of a large stockpile of Clb5/6-Cdk1 prior to activation. This stockpile is responsible for the consistently fast (i.e., switch-like) destruction of Sic1, leading to a sharp rise in Clb5/6-Cdk1 activity, buffering the variability in Clb5/6 level. It is possible to drive the transition only by Clb5/6-Cdk1 [35]. In this case, Sic1 degradation begins when Clb5/6-Cdk1 exceeds the Sic1 level, given that Sic1 inhibits Clb5/6-Cdk1 tightly [34]. Our model shows that this event will occur with a large timing variability if the rate of increase in Clb5/6 slows down as it approaches to Sic1 level. Cln1/2-Cdk1 corrects the timing of the double-negative feedback loop by initiating Sic1 degradation to compensate for the asymptotic approach of Clb5/6 to its steady-state level. It seems like timing variability can also be reduced by increasing the steady-state level of Clb5/6-Cdk1. Why nature chose to use Cln1/2-Cdk1 instead is an open question.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA Clear Picture of S Phase Entry\n\nGiven its essential role in guarding genome integrity, Sic1 destruction has been studied extensively within the last two decades. However, a clear understanding of the dynamic nature of the S phase entry did not emerge due to the discrepancies between the studies and lack of single-cell experiments.\n\nIn this article, we monitored the dynamics of Sic1 destruction in real time and in single cells, and provided a dynamic picture of the G1/S transition in yeast.. Our experiments show that both Cln1/2-Cdk1 and Clb5/6-Cdk1 contribute to Sic1 destruction in vivo. The role of Cln1/2-Cdk1 is to set the proper timing of Sic1 destruction, whereas the double negative feedback loop between Sic1 and Clb5/6-Cdk1 ensures the robustness of the destruction speed. The double-negative feedback loop functions as a noise filter, and is essential for the robust S-phase entry under genetic and environmental perturbations (Figure 7A). Interaction between Sic1 and Clb5/6-Cdk1 is analogous to the interaction between Rum1 and Cdc13-Cdc2 studied in [36],[37].\n\nAt first glance, involvement of two kinases in the phosphorylation of Sic1 seems like a redundancy. Sic1-Clb5/6-Cdk1 double-negative feedback loop generates irreversible and robustly sharp Sic1 destruction [38], and Clb5/6-Cdk1 is capable of triggering its own activation [34],[35]. Timing of the transition (i.e., when Clb5/6-Cdk1 level exceeds the Sic1 level) can be tuned by adjusting the synthesis/degradation rates of Clb5/6. Then why does Cln1/2-Cdk1 initiate the Sic1 degradation? A possible reason could be that Cln1/2-Cdk1 transcription initiation serves as a reference for the Start transition, which can be used to time the subsequent cell-cycle events. However, it is hard to imagine why Clb5/6 cannot serve as a reference since Cln1/2 and Clb5/6 are both on the G1/S regulon—that is, their transcription is coupled [39]. Our model suggests that Clb5/6-Cdk1 is not used to time its own activation because its asymptotic approach to steady state makes timing unreliable (second panel in Figure 6F and Figure S5D). Timing variability is reduced dramatically when Sic1 destruction is initiated by Cln1/2-Cdk1 as Clb5/6 rises. Collaboration of two kinases brings robustness in timing and speed of destruction of Sic1.\n\nSharing substrates between CDKs is almost a signature of the cell cycle control system. Here in this case, we provide an important functional implication for this apparent redundancy. Indeed, the regulatory motif we study here, a trigger coupled to a double-negative (or positive) feedback loop, occurs in the regulation of virtually every cell cycle transition (Figure 7B) [38].\n\nFunction of Multisite Phosphorylation\n\nMultisite phosphorylation of Sic1 by Cln1/2-Cdk1 was thought to be responsible for the switch-like destruction of Sic1 at the S phase entry [15],[24]. In principle, multisite phosphorylation can set a threshold for CDK activity and generate an ultrasensitive response. However, our experiments show that neither Cln1/2-Cdk1 nor a multisite phosphorylation scheme is necessary for switch-like destruction of Sic1. First, it is Clb5/6-Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation (but not Cln1/2-Cdk1) that leads to a rapid destruction of Sic1. Second, the threshold for Clb5/6-Cdk1 activity is set by Sic1 inhibition, not by multisite phosphorylation. Third, a single, optimized phosphosite on Sic1 can generate just as a rapid destruction as the wild-type. Our results are consistent with the recent theoretical studies, which suggest that while multisite phosphorylation can effectively establish a threshold, the response beyond the threshold may not be switch-like [25], and a sharp transition that relies on one-step “linear” ultrasensitivity alone may be prone to cellular noise [40].\n\nWe emphasize that, on wild-type Sic1, phosphorylation of multiple sites is required for a rapid destruction (see the docking network shown in figure 3 in [18]). In other words, no single site on wild-type Sic1 has a high enough affinity for Cdc4 to promote a rapid destruction. The mutant we use, Sic1CPD, has an optimized phosphosite specifically for this purpose. The result that Sic1CPD degrades as fast as the wild-type does not suggest that multisite phosphorylation is redundant. It is likely that multisite phosphorylation of Sic1 integrates Cln1/2-Cdk1 and Clb5/6-Cdk1 signals to optimize the response of the switch to its inputs. Besides the possibility of helping with the switching dynamics, it has been reported that some phosphorylation sites are important for cells to respond to stress [41]. This suggests that a benefit of having multiple phosphorylation sites is to interpret signals from other signaling pathways.\n\nThe requirement for multisite phosphorylation could potentially allow Sic1 to ignore low levels of Cln-CDK activity in early G1 phase and thus, in principle, could also help with the timing. Indeed, it seems the multisite phosphorylation does help with the timing in view of the Sic1CPD case. However, given the fact that the phosphorylation site of Sic1CPD is located on S76, which is a very Clb5-Cdk1 favored site [18], we cannot rule out the possibility that the large timing variability observed there is simply due to the lack of Cln1/2-Cdk specificity; and a single phosphorylation site may be able to achieve robust timing with some tuning.\n\nPopulation versus Single-cell measurements\n\nMost previous in vivo studies of Sic1 destruction dynamics have mainly relied on Western blotting of synchronized yeast populations, which, due to large cell-to-cell variability and intrinsic noise, do not accurately report the actual Sic1 concentration as a function of time in individual cells. As demonstrated in this work and some other works as well [29], some dynamic features of a system are easily discernible at the level of individual cells but may be hard to detect at the population level, and population average of protein dynamics sometimes can lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\nThe Contribution of Other B-Type Cyclins and Cdh1\n\nBesides Clb5 and Clb6, there are four other B-type cyclins in budding yeast. They all can phosphorylate Sic1 efficiently in vitro. Clb1–4 do not contribute to the DNA replication onset in wild-type, suggesting that they do not play a role in Sic1 destruction under normal conditions. However, since Clb1–4 initiates DNA replication in the absence of Clb5 and Clb6, we cannot rule out the possibility that Clb1–4 contribute to the Sic1 destruction in absence of Clb5 and Clb6. If that is the case, the Sic1 destruction with Cln1/2-Cdk1 activity only could be even slower than we observed in clb5Δclb6Δ cells.\n\nSome previous experiments suggested that Cdh1 is phosphorylated by Clb5 in vivo [42], which could imply that Cdh1 may be capable of forming another double negative feedback loop with Clb5/6 at G1/S transition. Therefore, we also investigated the potential function of Cdh1 in Sic1 destruction dynamics. We first monitored the Sic1* half life in cdh1Δ, and we found that it is similar to wild-type (Figure S5). Then we further perturbed the system by either deleting CLN1 and CLN2 in the cdh1Δ strain, or subjecting the cdh1Δ cells to stress (1 M KCl). In all cases, Sic1* half-life is similar to wild-type (Figure S2D, E), suggesting that Cdh1 does not contribute significantly to Sic1destruction dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, our study reveals the design principles of the biochemical switch at the G1/S transition: (1) the feedback loop between Clb5/6-Cdk1 and Sic1 is responsible for generating a sharp Clb5/6-Cdk1 activation robustly, and (2) Cln1/2-Cdk1 initiates Sic1 degradation and sets the timing of the activation (Figure 6F and Figure S5C). It is known that cyclin-CDKs often share their substrates in cell-cycle regulation. In this case we see that the apparent “redundancy” of Sic1 being a substrate of both Cln1/2-Cdk1 and Clb5/6-Cdk1 is an important part of the design of the G1/S switch. The regulatory motif we study here, a trigger coupled to a double-negative (or positive) feedback loop activated through multisite phosphorylation, occurs in the regulation of virtually every cell cycle transition (Figure 7B) as well as in other pathways [43], highlighting its utility in achieving both robust timing and decisive switching.\n\nMethods\n\nYeast Strains\n\nStandard methods were used throughout. Most strains used in this study were congenic S288c, except the SIC1-0P strain from Frederick R. Cross [44]. All SIC1 mutants were introduced at the chromosomal SIC1 locus under the control of the endogenous SIC1 promoter. The KanMX/NAT/LEU2 fragments, flanking with homologous sequence to the target gene (∼40–50 bp), were used to delete genes. Genotypes of deletion strains were tested by PCR. All single mutant strains were characterized by sequencing PCR products.\n\nThe plasmid pCT03 (pGREG506-ADH1pr-mCherry) was obtained by subcloning ADH1 promoter (starting from 713 bp upstream of the start codon of gene ADH1, and PCR from the genome) into the SacI-NotI site and inserting the NotI-SalI fragment containing mCherry with a 11 amino acid linker (Ala-Ala-Ala-Gly-Asp-Gly-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Asn-) [45] at the N terminal (PCR from pNT11, a kind gift of Jonathan Weissman (UCSF)). Plasmids pCT04, pCT05, and pCT06 were constructed by inserting NotI-NotI fragments containing the regulatory domain of Sic1 (1–220 aa, PCR from the genome), MCM marker (PCR from pML103, a kind gift of Joachim Li (UCSF) [46]), and HTB2 (PCR from the genome), respectively. The plasmid pCT07 was constructed by inserting GFP (PCR from the plasmid pNT10, a kind gift of Jonathan Weissman (UCSF)) at SpeI-SalI, and inserting the PEST sequence of CLN2 [47] (PCR from the genome) at SalI of the plasmid pGREG533. Then plasmids pCT08, pCT09, and pCT10 were constructed by inserting CLN2 promoter (starting from 656 bp upstream of the start codon of the gene CLN2, PCR from the genome), CLB5 promoter (starting from 800 bp upstream of the start codon of the gene CLB5, PCR from the genome), and SWI4 promoter (starting from 1,068 bp upstream of the start codon of the gene SWI4, PCR from the genome). All plasmids were characterized by sequencing.\n\nTime-Lapse Microscopy\n\nCells growing exponentially in synthetic liquid medium were seeded onto thin 1.5%–2% agrose slabs of the same medium. Multiple different positions were followed simultaneously. Images were acquired every 1 min for Sic1 half-life experiments, 3 min for timing experiments, and 7 min for promoter experiments.\n\nFor endogenous Sic1 experiments, fluorescence and phase microscopy were performed using a TE2000E Inverted Microscope (Nikon) with perfect Focus, Apo 60×/1.40 NA oil-immersion objective, a Cascade II 512 CCD (Photometrics), and NIS-Elements Advanced Research software. The microscopy experiments of Sic1 reporter and promoters were performed in the University of California San Francisco Nikon Imaging Center using a TE2000E Inverted Microscope (Nikon) with perfect Focus, Apo 60×/1.20 NA water-immersion objective, a Coolsnap HQ2 Camera (Photometrics), and NIS-Elements Advanced Research software (http://nic.ucsf.edu/timelapse.html). Potential toxicity of fluorescence illumination was tested with pre-experiments.\n\nImage Analyses\n\nImage segmentation and fluorescence quantification were performed using custom Matlab software and ImageJ. Custom Matlab software was used to fit an exponential function to the fluorescence data to obtain the half-life of the endogenous and reporter Sic1 in various strains.\n\nHalf-Life Analysis\n\nFluorescence signals from endogenous Sic1 or Sic1 reporter/mutants were extracted from the images. We fitted an exponential function to the signal intensity data to obtain the half-life of the protein (Figure 2C, Text S1).\n\nFor Sic1 reporter, we fitted the function directly onto the mean reporter fluorescence signal from the maximum-intensity 5×5 square. For endogenous Sic1, we first divided the mean nuclear Sic1 intensity by the mean nuclear label intensity and fitted the function onto the resulting values.\n\nThe function we fitted to the fluorescence signal iswhere y is the time series of fluorescence signal. However, since this function will cause a bias towards larger values, we also fit the signal to this form of the function:\n\nTo fit using Eq. 2, we first found the constant C that gives the straightest line in the log domain when subtracted from the data. Then we fitted a straight line to the log subtracted data and the absolute value of the slope is the degradation rate.\n\nStochastic Model\n\nThe chemical Langevin equation [48] was used to simulate the intrinsic noise. Extrinsic noise was simulated by randomizing the model parameters around their nominal values within a certain percentage range. Sic1 half-life was measured in many realizations of the stochastic simulation. See Text S2 for details.\n\nIn Silico Evolution\n\nAll simulations start with low concentrations of kinases and a high concentration of Inhibitor. Kinase1 and Kinase2 have identical synthesis and degradation rates, but their profiles vary as the rates are subject to extrinsic noise (Figures 6B,F and S5C). Inhibitor level does not vary. We define timing of the transition as the time when Kinase2 level exceeds that of Inhibitor, and sharpness as the slope of free Kinase2 at its half-maximum level.\n\nWe start the simulation with 1,000 copies of the switch, each assigned a random set of Kinase1 or Kinase2 catalytic efficiencies (i.e., phosphorylation rates) at each phosphosite. We run each copy and calculate a fitness score based on timing or sharpness of the transition. We eliminate half of the population with lowest scores and duplicate the survivors to make up the deficit. Lastly, we mutate the catalytic efficiencies for each phosphosite in each duplicate by a small rate. We repeat this process for 1,000 generations. We assume that phosphorylation is ordered—that is, site 1 is phosphorylated first, site 2 is phosphorylated second, etc. See Text S3 for details.\n\nSupporting Information"
