  "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) are two predominant forms of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis, elicited by moderate and strong stimuli, respectively.

  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nIn the presynaptic terminal, continuous release of synaptic vesicles (SVs) results in vesicle pool depletion, plasma membrane expansion, and SV protein overloading at the release site [1]. Endocytosis is therefore tightly coupled to exocytosis [2]. Among the different modes of SV endocytosis, Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) are well characterized [3,4]. In mild stimulation paradigms, CME is the prevalent mode of retrieving exocytic SVs in the form of a single SV [5,6]. In intense stimulation paradigms, however, ADBE promotes the uptake of large pieces of fused membranes in bulk endosomes or cisternae [7,8]. Small SVs are then formed from these membranous structures.\n\nSV exocytosis is a prerequisite for CME and ADBE initiation [2], indicating that specific SV cargoes, an exocytic protein complex, or both are needed to trigger both modes of endocytosis. Indeed, Synaptotagmin, the SV Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis [9], and components of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex play crucial roles in CME [10–14]. Moreover, recent studies have identified vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4), a vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) protein, as a selective SV cargo for ADBE. Interestingly, VAMP4 is responsible for the formation of ADBE as well [15]. Thus, SV proteins encode components that retrieve SV membrane in newly formed vesicles as well as coordinate the nature of the formation of SV endocytosis.\n\nAn increased local Ca2+ concentration in the presynaptic terminal is necessary not only for exocytosis but also for endocytosis [16–20]. Moreover, the Calmodulin/Calcineurin complex was proposed to function as a Ca2+ sensor for CME and ADBE [19,21,22]. Therefore, Ca2+/Calcineurin likely acts as a universal signal that elicits most forms of the SV retrieval [2]. At the rat Calyx of Held, in addition to a role in triggering exocytosis, a high, transient Ca2+ influx via a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) triggers CME [18,23]. However, the Ca2+ channel for triggering ADBE is unknown.\n\nOur previous genetic screen in flies identified Flower (Fwe), an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein [24]. Fwe forms a Ca2+-permeable channel when expressed in heterologous cells or when incorporated into proteoliposomes. This protein localizes to SVs, and, upon SV release, Fwe is transferred to the periactive zone, where it triggers CME, thereby coupling exocytosis to CME. In the present study, we show that Fwe initiates ADBE as well. Intriguingly, the effects of Fwe on CME and ADBE depend on the strength of the stimulus. We found that the function of Fwe for regulating CME does not involve Ca2+ channeling. Instead, upon intense stimulation, Fwe triggers a Ca2+ influx that elicits ADBE. Lastly, when we removed ratFwe in cultured rat hippocampal neurons through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology, CME is impaired but not completely blocked, similar to the defect caused by the Drosophila fwe mutation. Furthermore, our data reveal that RatFwe is also involved in the induction of ADBE at mammalian central synapses. In summary, the Fwe channel exerts two different functions in response to two different stimuli that govern distinct modes of SV retrieval, thereby coupling exocytosis to endocytosis.\n\nResults\n\nFwe promotes CME independently of Ca2+channeling\n\nWe previously reported that the Fwe Ca2+ channel promotes CME in the synaptic boutons of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) [24]. To investigate whether the Ca2+ influx via Fwe plays a direct role in CME, we utilized the FweE79Q mutant whose channel activity is severely impaired [24] and assessed the ability to rescue CME defects associated with fwe mutants. We expressed UAS-flag-fwe-HA and UAS-flag-fweE79Q-HA with nSyb-GAL4, a pan-neuron GAL4 driver, in a strong loss of fwe background (fweDB25/fweDB56) (S1A and S1B Fig) [24]. α-HA antibody staining was used to examine the distribution and expression of Fwe proteins in boutons. α-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) antibody staining labels the insect neuronal membranes, thereby outlining presynaptic compartments [25]. Both the wild-type Fwe and FweE79Q proteins are evenly distributed in boutons (S1A and S1B Fig). We then introduced a genomic HA-tagged fwe transgene to estimate the relative expression levels of UAS transgenes versus endogenous Fwe protein (S1C–S1F Fig). The proteins are expressed at ~50% of the endogenous Fwe protein level in type Ib NMJ boutons (S1L–S1N Fig), whereas their expressions in type Is NMJ boutons correspond to ~80% of the endogenous Fwe protein.\n\nTo estimate the efficacy of CME, we performed the FM1-43 dye uptake assay with moderate stimuli, i.e., 1-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ and 10-min 60 mM K+/1 mM Ca2+ stimulations. The experimental paradigm is shown in S2A Fig. Both stimulation paradigms significantly elicit dye uptake in wild-type control larvae when compared to a resting paradigm (10-min incubation in 5 mM K+/0 mM Ca2+ solution) (S2B–S2E Fig). We then performed a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to assess the formation of bulk cisternae, a hallmark of ADBE [2,8]. No bulk cisternae were induced under these conditions (S2F–S2I Fig), showing that the strength of these stimuli is mild, which predominantly promotes CME. Upon 1-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ stimulation, loss of fwe impairs FM1-43 dye uptake (Fig 1A, 1B and 1H). It is possible that either a defect in SV endocytosis or exocytosis would reduce FM1-43 dye uptake in this case. To test the role of Fwe in SV exocytosis, we performed the FM1-43 dye loading/unloading assay. The experimental paradigm is indicated in S3A Fig. Both the control and fwe mutant boutons were subjected to 5-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ stimulation, which labels the SV pool with FM1-43 dye (S3B and S3D Fig). Subsequently, 1-min stimulation with the same solution releases the SVs and unloads the dye from SVs (S3C and S3E Fig). The strength of SV exocytosis is correlated with the FM1-43 dye unloading efficiency ([(Fload—Funload) / Fload]). While the dye loading is significantly reduced when fwe is lost (S3B, S3D and S3F Fig), the dye unloading efficiencies of controls and fwe mutants are comparable (S3G Fig), indicating that Fwe plays a marginal or no role in SV exocytosis. Hence, the FM1-43 dye uptake deficit associated with fwe mutants mainly results from a defect in CME.\n\nReduced FM1-43 dye uptake in fwe mutants is completely rescued by the reintroduction of 50% Fwe protein (Fig 1C and 1H). However, a similar rescue was also observed when 50% FweE79Q is present (Fig 1D and 1H). Although the channel function of FweE79Q is mostly absent when analyzed in fly salivary glands [24], the remaining channel activity in this mutant might be sufficient to promote CME if enough proteins are present in the boutons. We therefore determined the minimal Fwe level required for CME to verify the channel function of Fwe. After surveying numerous GAL4 lines, elav-GAL4 and nSyb(w)-GAL4 were found to drive the expression of the transgenes at approximately 0% and 4% of the endogenous Fwe level, respectively (S1G–S1J, S1M and S1N Fig). As shown in Fig 1E, 1F and 1H, boutons expressing 10% or 4% Fwe can take up FM1-43 dye efficiently. We noted that the dye uptake with 4% Fwe expression is marginally reduced when compared to other Fwe-expressing larvae, indicating that this level of Fwe expression is near the minimal level for efficient CME.\n\nNext, we assessed CME in 4% FweE79Q-expressing boutons (S1J, S1K, S1M and S1N Fig). Intriguingly, the efficiency of the dye uptake is not different between 4% Fwe and 4% Fwe E79Q-expressing boutons (Fig 1F–1H), suggesting that CME can occur despite the lack of a significant Ca2+ influx via Fwe. We previously showed that loss of fwe results in a reduced SV number and enlarged SVs [24]. To examine the changes in SV ultrastructure, we performed TEM. The wild-type control bouton under the resting condition contains numerous SVs (Fig 1I), whereas the number of SVs is decreased upon loss of fwe (Fig 1J and 1Q). This low SV number worsens following 10-min 60 mM K+/1 mM Ca2+ stimulation (Fig 1M, 1N and 1Q). Either 4% Fwe or 4% FweE79Q expression rescues this SV loss (Fig 1K, 1L and 1O–1Q). In addition, enlarged SV sizes associated with fwe mutants are normalized under both expression conditions (Fig 1R). Hence, these data indicate that Fwe triggers CME independent of Ca2+ channeling.\n\nFwe initiates ADBE upon intense stimulation\n\nUpon mild stimulation, CME retrieves the membrane that corresponds in size to an SV. In contrast, in response to intense stimulation, ADBE takes up large quantities of fused SVs from the plasma membrane to form bulk cisternae. It has been shown that both SV exocytosis and intracellular Ca2+ elevation are essential for ADBE to proceed around the periactive zones [7,18,26]. This raises the possibility that Fwe may play a role in ADBE. High K+ and Ca2+-containing solutions have been widely used to elicit ADBE at several different synapses, including fly NMJ boutons [8,27–30]. To assess the role of Fwe in ADBE, we applied 10-min 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+ stimulation to induce ADBE and examine the formation of bulk cisternae using a TEM assay. The TEM image of control boutons reveals numerous cisternae (&gt;80 nm in diameter, red arrows) elicited by this stimulation paradigm (Fig 2A, 2B and 2G). These processes, however, are dramatically suppressed by loss of fwe (Fig 2C, 2D and 2G). In unstimulated conditions, bulk cisternae are also less abundant in fwe mutants than in controls (Fig 2G). This ADBE defect indeed results from the fwe mutation, as 50% Fwe expression rescues this ADBE phenotype (Fig 2E–2G). Interestingly, the average size of the few bulk cisternae observed in fwe mutants is comparable to that observed in control boutons (Fig 2H), suggesting that Fwe acts at the initiation step of ADBE rather than during a late membrane invagination process. Furthermore, following high K+ stimulation, the accumulation of early endocytic intermediates was observed around the periactive zone in fwe mutant boutons (Fig 2D–2D1 and 2I, yellow arrows) when compared to wild-type controls and 50% Fwe-rescued larvae (Fig 2B–2B1, 2F–2F1 and 2I). Since optimal SV exocytosis is shown as a prerequisite for triggering ADBE [7,26], we therefore estimated the total SV area per bouton area under the resting condition. No difference between controls and fwe mutants was found (Fig 2J), showing that the ADBE defect associated with fwe mutants is not due to insufficient supply of exocytic SV membrane upon stimulation. Moreover, following 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+ stimulation, the strength of SV exocytosis determined by the FM1-43 dye loading/unloading assay is comparable between controls and fwe mutants (S3H–S3N Fig). Collectively, these results reveal that Fwe is responsible for initiating ADBE during intense activity stimulation.\n\nAcute inactivation of the components involved in CME, such as Clathrin, AP180, and Dynamin, elicits bulk membrane invaginations [31–34], suggesting that CME suppresses ADBE or that ADBE is the result of membrane expansions. To assess the role of Fwe in this process, we treated larvae with 200 μM chlorpromazine to inhibit Clathrin coat assembly [31], followed by 10-min 90 mM K+/ 2 mM Ca2+ stimulation in the presence of FM1-43 dye. As shown in Fig 2K–2N, large membranous invaginations enriched with FM1-43 dye were detected in the controls. In contrast, these structures decrease upon loss of fwe. In summary, these results reinforce the functional importance of Fwe in ADBE.\n\nThe Ca2+ influx via Fwe sustains presynaptic Ca2+ levels during strong stimulation\n\nTo assess whether Fwe mediates an intracellular Ca2+ increase to initiate ADBE upon intense activity stimulation, we expressed the lexAop2 transgene of the fast-decay version of the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6, GCaMP6f [35], in the presynaptic terminals with vglut-lexA, a glutamatergic neuron driver. We have shown previously that fwe mutant boutons display low resting Ca2+ levels [24]. Similarly, decreased GCaMP6f fluorescence was observed upon loss of fwe (Fig 3A, 3B and 3E, white arrows). This indicates a reduction in the resting Ca2+ levels, as the expression level of GCaMP6f in boutons is higher in fwe mutants than in controls (S4A, S4B and S4E Fig). Next, we stimulated boutons with 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+ solution for 10 min, which elicits ADBE (Fig 2A and 2B), and measured GCaMP6f fluorescence in the 6th and 10th min. In controls, the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in response to stimuli are substantially increased (Fig 3A–3A3 and 3F), whereas loss of fwe significantly impedes these Ca2+ elevations (Fig 3B–3B3 and 3F). Hence, Fwe sustains presynaptic Ca2+ levels upon strong stimulation.\n\nTo assess the role of Fwe-derived Ca2+ influx in regulating presynaptic Ca2+ level, we traced GCaMP6f fluorescence in 4% Fwe- and 4% FweE79Q-expressing boutons under the resting and high K+ stimulation conditions. In both conditions, the levels of GCaMP6f are expressed similarly to that in controls (S4C–S4E Fig). We found that 4% Fwe but not 4% FweE79Q expression restores normal resting Ca2+ levels in fwe mutants (Fig 3C–3E). Furthermore, a defect in high K+-induced Ca2+ elevation associated with fwe mutants is partially reversed by 4% Fwe expression (Fig 3C–3C3 and 3F). In contrast, 4% FweE79Q expression fails to rescue this Ca2+ defect (Fig 3D–3D3 and 3F). However, when we examined the presynaptic Ca2+ changes following 1-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ stimulation, which prevalently elicits CME (S2 Fig), the Ca2+ increases among all genotypes are quite similar (Fig 3G). Hence, these results indicate that Fwe triggers a Ca2+ influx specifically in response to strong stimuli.\n\nTo verify this stimulus-dependent Ca2+ channeling of Fwe, we measured the Ca2+ increase evoked by electric stimuli in wild-type and fwe mutant boutons. To this end, we expressed UAS-GCaMP6f with nSyb-GAL4. The levels of GCaMP6f in control and fwe mutant boutons are comparable (S4F, S4G and S4K Fig). The stimulation paradigms are shown in the top panel of Fig 3H. Upon 10–40 Hz train stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ increase in controls correlates with the stimulus strength (S5A–S5A4 Fig and Fig 3H, white circle). In fwe mutants (S5B–S5B4 Fig and Fig 3H, red circle), the Ca2+ increase at 10 Hz is slightly higher than that in controls, and the Ca2+ increase at 20 Hz is similar to that in controls. In contrast, at 40 Hz, loss of fwe significantly impairs the evoked Ca2+ increase (Fig 3H and 3I). Moreover, 50% Fwe expression normalizes this deficit (S4H, S4K and S5C–S5C4 Figs and Fig 3H and 3I, black circle), whereas a partial restoration by 50% FweE79Q expression was observed (S4I, S4K and S5D–S5D4 Figs and Fig 3H and 3I, orange circle). Furthermore, we observed similar effects on rescuing low resting Ca2+ levels associated with fwe mutants (S5F Fig). These results support the finding that Fwe does not mediate a Ca2+ influx under a moderate stimulation condition that predominantly induces CME. Instead, it conducts a Ca2+ influx when neurons undergo intense stimulation.\n\nTo rule out that the defect in evoked Ca2+ increase may be attributed to slow CME associated with fwe mutants, we applied the same stimulation protocol to dap160 mutants, which exhibit a similar CME defect [36–38]. As shown in S5E–S5E4 Fig and Fig 3H and 3I (green circle), in dap160 mutant boutons, the Ca2+ concentrations at 40 Hz are elevated to wild-type levels, although the Ca2+ increase at 10 and 20 Hz is higher than that observed in controls and fwe mutants. In addition, the fluorescence level but not the expression level of GCaMP6f under the resting condition is reduced upon loss of dap160 (S4J, S4K, S5E and S5F Figs), suggesting that dap160 mutants display low resting Ca2+ levels. Therefore, our results argue that a defective CME does not account for presynaptic Ca2+ dysregulation in fwe mutants. In addition, we found no evidence for the changes in the distribution and expression of Cacophony, the major VGCC located at the active zone (S6 Fig).\n\nFwe triggers a Ca2+ influx to initiate ADBE during intense activity stimulation\n\nThe above-mentioned results prompted investigations into the role of Fwe-driven Ca2+ influx in ADBE. We showed previously that 4% Fwe is sufficient for CME. We therefore addressed if this level of Fwe is sufficient to promote ADBE. When boutons are expressed with 10% or 4% Fwe, ADBE elicited by 10-min 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+ stimulation efficiently produces bulk cisternae (Fig 4A, 4B, 4D, 4E and 4K). Thus, a partial Ca2+ influx by 4% Fwe (Fig 3F) is sufficient for initiating ADBE. Consistently, 50% FweE79Q, which induces a fractional Ca2+ influx (Fig 3H and 3I), robustly triggers ADBE after high K+ stimulation (S7 Fig). However, high K+-induced bulk cisternae are significantly reduced in 4% FweE79Q-rescued larvae (Fig 4G, 4H and 4K). Notably, the number of high K+-induced bulk cisternae between 4% FweE79Q-rescued and fwe mutant larvae is comparable (fwe mutant larvae, 1.06 ± 0.4, n = 22, versus 4% FweE79Q-rescued larvae, 1.66 ± 0.42, n = 26, [Student’s t test, p = 0.31]). Similar to loss of fwe, there is an increase in the level of endocytic intermediates formed around the periactive zone in 4% FweE79Q-rescued boutons after high K+ stimulation when compared to 4% Fwe-rescued boutons (Fig 4L), thus supporting an important role of Ca2+ influx via Fwe in ADBE. At rest, the total SV membrane area per bouton area is also comparable between 4% Fwe- and 4% FweE79Q-rescued boutons (Fig 4M). Therefore, both expression conditions yield equal SV membranes available for SV exocytosis. These data suggest that Fwe triggers ADBE mainly through fluxing Ca2+. Furthermore, after chlorpromazine treatment, bulk membrane invaginations are less abundant in 4% FweE79Q-rescued boutons when compared to 4% Fwe-rescued boutons, also documenting a role of Fwe-derived Ca2+ influx in chlorpromazine-induced bulk membrane invagination (Fig 4N–4P).\n\nIf a suboptimal Ca2+ level in the presynaptic terminals results in impaired ADBE phenotype in 4% FweE79Q-rescued larvae, then we expected that increasing overall intracellular Ca2+ concentrations either via the remaining channel activity of FweE79Q or the other Ca2+ channels during stimulation might compensate for this low intracellular Ca2+ and rescue the defective ADBE. We therefore raised the Ca2+ concentration from 2 mM to 5 mM in our 90 mM K+ stimulation solution. When we applied a 10-min 90 mM K+/5 mM Ca2+ stimulation to 4% FweE79Q-rescued boutons, the bulk cisternae number is significantly rescued (Fig 4I and 4K). Similarly, 5mM Ca2+ also rescues the ADBE deficit associated with fwe mutants (Fig 4J and 4K). In contrast, this treatment does not increase the number of bulk cisternae further in 4% or 10% Fwe-rescued larvae when compared to the 10-min 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+ stimulation condition (Fig 4C, 4F and 4K). Hence, this rescue effect might be due to increased Ca2+ levels rather than enhanced ADBE in the presynaptic compartments. These data further support the role of Ca2+ influx via Fwe in triggering ADBE during intense activity stimulation.\n\nLanthanum (La3+) blocks Fwe-mediated Ca2+ influx and impedes ADBE\n\nIf Ca2+ influx via Fwe triggers ADBE, one would anticipate that reducing channel activity will abolish ADBE. La3+ is a potent blocker of some Ca2+-permeable channels [39,40]. It may therefore inhibit the Fwe channel activity. We previously showed that heterologous expression of Fwe results in Ca2+ uptake by Drosophila salivary gland cells [24]. To determine the effect of La3+ on the Ca2+ conductance of Fwe, we applied 100 μM La3+ to the glands that carry a GAL4 driver only or overexpress Fwe and performed Ca2+ imaging. The cells were loaded with Fluo-4 AM Ca2+ indicator and bathed in 100 μM extracellular Ca2+ solution. Fwe-overexpressing cells display a slow but significant Ca2+ uptake over a 1-h period when compared to controls (Fig 5A, 5B and 5E), consistent with our previous observations [24]. However, application of 100 μM La3+ solution nearly abolishes the Ca2+ influx mediated by Fwe (Fig 5D–5E), although a mild suppression was observed in control cells as well (Fig 5C and 5E). These results indicate that, similar to other Ca2+-permeable channels, the channel pore region of Fwe has a high affinity for La3+ and is blocked by La3+.\n\nNext, we assessed the impact of 100 μM La3+ on ADBE. Since La3+ impedes Ca2+ permeability of VGCCs [39,40], and VGCC-triggered exocytosis is essential for ADBE initiation [7,26], we first tested whether treatment with100 μM La3+ solution affects SV exocytosis. At 0.2 Hz in 1 mM Ca2+, 100 μM La3+ reduces the amplitude of excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) by ~60%–80% when compared to untreated ones, indicating that La3+ blocks a Ca2+ influx mediated by VGCCs. In contrast, 10 μM La3+ does not significantly influence 0.2 Hz-elicited EJPs in controls (Fig 5F, white column). As this low La3+ concentration might not block the Fwe-derived Ca2+ influx effectively, we used 10% Fwe-rescued larvae, which are more sensitive to 10 μM La3+ (Fig 5B). Under this expression condition, the application of 10 μM La3+ does not affect the EJP responses at 0.2 Hz (Fig 5F, green column) but largely reduces ADBE upon high K+ stimulation (Fig 5G and 5I). Notably, the number of bulk cisternae induced under La3+ treatment is almost identical to that observed in fwe mutants after high K+-stimulation (Fig 5I), suggesting that La3+ suppresses ADBE by selectively inhibiting the channel activity of Fwe. In support of this, in fwe mutants, 10 μM La3+ does not alter the 0.2 Hz-evoked EJP amplitude (Fig 5F, red column) or the level of high K+-induced bulk cisternae (Fig 5H and 5I). Overall, these data indicate a role of Fwe in Ca2+-mediated ADBE. In summary, Fwe governs two major modes of SV endocytosis to permit consecutive rounds of exocytosis of neurotransmitters following distinct activity stimuli.\n\nRodent Fwe isoform 2 is associated with SVs and can substitute the endocytic functions of Drosophila Fwe\n\nFwe homologs are found in most eukaryotes [24], but their role in SV endocytosis in vertebrates has not been established. The mouse Fwe (mFwe) gene can generate at least six alternative mRNA splicing isoforms [41], producing five different mFwe isoforms (S8 Fig). The mFwe isoform 2 (mFwe2) is the most similar to Drosophila Fwe. Moreover, the mFwe2 and rat Fwe isoform 2 (ratFwe2) share ~99% amino acid identity (170/172). In adult rat brain, ratFwe2 mRNA is widely expressed (Fig 6A). In the lysates of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a (n2a) cells, our antisera against the C-termini of both mFwe2 and ratFwe2 (α-m/ratFwe2) recognize a ~18 kDa protein band, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of mFwe2 (Fig 6B). This signal is significantly decreased when mFwe2 is knocked down by mFwe-microRNAi (miRNAi) (Fig 6B), showing antibody specificity. mFwe2 is expressed in postnatal as well as adult mouse brains (Fig 6B). Similarly, ratFwe2 was detected in rat brain and cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Fig 6C).\n\nTo determine if ratFwe2 is enriched in SVs, we purified SVs from adult rat brain using a series of centrifugations [42]. As shown in Fig 6D, ratFwe2 was specifically detected in the SV (Lysate pellet 2 [LP2]) fraction, marked by the presence of Synaptophysin (Syp), an abundant SV protein. ratFwe2 is also present in the SV fractions of adult rat brain separated with sucrose gradients (Fig 6E). To assess the subcellular localization of ratFwe2, we performed immunostaining in cultured neurons. Although staining with our antisera can visualize the expression of ratFwe2 in the cell bodies (S9B Fig), we failed to obtain specific staining in the presynaptic terminals. We therefore expressed HA-tagged mFwe2 in ratFwe knockout neurons (see below for details) and determined the SV localization of mFwe2-HA using α-HA staining. As shown in Fig 6F and 6G, mFwe2-HA protein is enriched in the presynaptic terminals and largely colocalized with Syp. The biochemical data combined with the in vivo localization data provide compelling evidence that ratFwe2 is associated with SV proteins, similar to Drosophila Fwe.\n\nTo determine whether rodent Fwe2 functions equivalently to Drosophila Fwe, we expressed UAS-flag-mFwe2-HA transgene in fwe mutants using nSyb(w)-GAL4. Overexpressed mFwe2 is localized to SVs in the boutons (Fig 6H–6H2) and rescues the FM1-43 dye uptake defect (Fig 6I–6K), as well as the reduced number of SVs (Fig 6L) in fwe mutants, showing that mFwe2 can promote CME in flies. Furthermore, the expression of mFwe2 corrects the ADBE deficit caused by loss of fwe (Fig 6M and 6N). Hence, mFwe2 promotes ADBE as well. We also observed that the early lethality of fwe mutant larvae is rescued by mFwe2 expression. Our results therefore suggest a conserved role of Fwe in SV endocytosis in mammals.\n\nThe endocytic roles of Fwe are conserved at mammalian central synapses\n\nTo verify the role of ratFwe2 in SV endocytosis, we knocked out ratFwe in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using CRISPR/Cas9 technology [43]. We designed a specific guide RNA (gRNA; m/ratFwe-gRNA) that targets the first intron/second exon junction of both mFwe and ratFwe genes. To estimate the knockout efficiency, we transfected the gRNA construct into mouse neuroblastoma n2a cells and established a mFwe knockout n2a cell line. While mFwe2 was detected in normal n2a cells, it is lost in mFwe knockout n2a cells (S9A Fig). At 14 days in vitro (DIV), ratFwe2 is present in the Golgi apparatus of the cultured rat hippocampal neurons (S9B–S9B3 Fig), consistent with the fact that ratFwe2 is an SV protein sorted from the Golgi. In neurons expressing Cas9 and m/ratFwe-gRNA, the expression of ratFwe2 in the Golgi apparatus is significantly diminished (S9C and S9D Fig). Thus, this gRNA can also efficiently remove ratFwe2 in cultured neurons when Cas9 is present.\n\nTo assess the efficacy of CME, we elicited exocytosis of Synaptophysin-pHluorin (SypHy) [5] by delivering 200 action potentials at 20 Hz and monitored its retrieval via SV endocytosis. It has been documented that this mild stimulation paradigm prevalently induces CME [12,15,44]. In control neurons (Fig 7A, black line) bathed at room temperature, repeated exocytosis in response to 20-Hz stimuli increases SypHy fluorescence, followed by a gradual fluorescence decay caused by the reacidification of SVs formed via CME. However, in ratFwe knockout neurons (Fig 7A, red line), the decay rate of SypHy fluorescence is much slower (Fig 7A and 7C). To verify whether this defect is specific to loss of ratFwe2, we expressed mFwe2-HA in ratfwe knockout neurons. mFwe2-HA properly localizes in the Golgi (S9E Fig) as well as in SVs (Fig 6F and 6G). This protein further normalizes the slow SypHy fluorescence decay (Fig 7A and 7C, blue line). Recent studies have revealed distinct properties of SV endocytosis under physiological conditions [15,45,46]. We found similar results when these recordings were performed at physiological temperatures (Fig 7B and 7D). A slow decay of SypHy fluorescence is possibly due to either impaired CME or inefficient SV reacidification or both. To distinguish these hypotheses, we performed an acidic quenching assay [47,48]. As shown in S10 Fig, upon perfusion of an acidic buffer, the newly recycled SVs in both control and ratFwe knockout neurons are efficiently acidified. Hence, our data suggest that ratFwe2 promotes CME at mammalian central synapses.\n\nTo assess the role of ratFwe2 in ADBE, we performed a dextran dye uptake assay in the control and ratFwe knockout neurons. We triggered ADBE with a stimulation of 1,600 action potentials delivered at 80 Hz in the presence of 40 kDa tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-dextran [15,49]. As shown in Fig 7E–7H, in the control axons marked with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, the presynaptic terminals filled with dextran dye (red puncta) were observed frequently. In contrast, removal of ratFwe significantly diminishes dextran dye uptake. This phenotype is specific to loss of ratFwe2, as the reintroduction of mFwe2-HA corrects this dye uptake defect. Hence, ratFwe2 is indispensable for ADBE. In summary, Fwe promotes CME and ADBE in mammalian neurons, thereby coupling exocytosis to two major modes of endocytosis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA tight coupling of exocytosis and endocytosis is critical for supporting continuous exocytosis of neurotransmitters. CME and ADBE are well-characterized forms of SV endocytosis triggered by moderate and strong nerve stimuli, respectively. However, how they are coupled with exocytosis under distinct stimulation paradigms remains less explored. Based on the present data, we propose a model as shown in Fig 7I. When presynaptic terminals are mildly stimulated, SV release leads to neurotransmitter release and the transfer of Fwe channel from SVs to the periactive zone where CME and ADBE occur actively [7,26,38]. Our data suggest that this channel does not supply Ca2+ for CME to proceed. However, intense activity promotes Fwe to elevate presynaptic Ca2+ levels near endocytic zones where ADBE is subsequently triggered. Thus, Fwe exerts different activities and properties in response to different stimuli to couple exocytosis to different modes of endocytosis.\n\nWe previously concluded that Fwe-dependent Ca2+ influx triggers CME [24]. However, the current results suggest alternative explanations. First, the presynaptic Ca2+ concentrations elicited by moderate activity conditions, i.e., 1-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ or 20-s 10–20 Hz electric stimulation, are not dependent on Fwe (Fig 3G and 3H). Second, expression of 4% FweE79Q, a condition that abolishes Ca2+ influx via Fwe (Fig 3F), rescues the CME defects associated with fwe mutants, including decreased FM1-43 dye uptake, a reduced number of SVs, and enlarged SVs (Fig 1). Third, raising the presynaptic Ca2+ level has no beneficial impact on the reduced number of SVs observed in fwe mutants (Fig 4J). These data are consistent with the observations that a Ca2+ influx dependent on VGCCs triggers CME at a mammalian synapse [18,23]. Hence, Fwe acts in parallel with or downstream to VGCC-mediated Ca2+ influx during CME.\n\nADBE is triggered by intracellular Ca2+ elevation, which has been assumed to be driven by VGCCs that are located at the active zones [18,26]. However, our data strongly support a role for Fwe as an important Ca2+ channel for ADBE. First, following exocytosis, Fwe is enriched at the periactive zone where ADBE predominates [7,24,26]. Second, Fwe selectively supplies Ca2+ to the presynaptic compartment during intense activity stimulation (Fig 3), which is highly correlated with the rapid formation of ADBE upon stimulation [8,50]. Third, 4% FweE79Q expression, which induces very subtle or no Ca2+ upon strong stimulation, fails to rescue the ADBE defect associated with loss of fwe (Figs 3 and 4). Fourth, treatment with a low concentration of La3+ solution that specifically blocks the Ca2+ conductance of Fwe significantly abolishes ADBE (Fig 5). Lastly, the role of Fwe-derived Ca2+ influx in the initiation of ADBE mimics the effect of Ca2+ on ADBE at the rat Calyx of Held [7]. As loss of fwe does not completely eliminate ADBE, our results do not exclude the possibility that VGCC may function in parallel with Fwe to promote ADBE following intense stimulation.\n\nInterestingly, Ca2+ influx via Fwe does not control SV exocytosis during mild and intense stimulations (S3 Fig). How do VGCC and Fwe selectively regulate SV exocytosis and ADBE, respectively? One potential mechanism is that VGCC triggers a high, transient Ca2+ influx around the active zone that elicits SV exocytosis. In contrast, Fwe is activated at the periactive zone to create a spatially and temporally distinct Ca2+ microdomain. A selective failure to increase the presynaptic Ca2+ level during strong stimulation is evident upon loss of fwe. This pinpoints to an activity-dependent gating of the Fwe channel. Consistent with this finding, an increase in the level of Fwe in the plasma membrane does not lead to presynaptic Ca2+ elevation at the Calyx of Held when the presynaptic terminals are at rest or subject to mild stimulation [23]. However, we previously showed that, in shits terminals, blocking CME results in the accumulation of the Fwe channel in the plasma membrane, elevating Ca2+ levels [24]. It is possible that Dynamin is also involved in regulating the channel activity of Fwe or that the effects other than Fwe accumulation associated with shits mutants may affect intracellular Ca2+ handling [51,52]. Further investigation of how neuronal activity gates the channel function of Fwe should advance our knowledge on the activity-dependent exo–endo coupling.\n\nAlthough a proteomic analysis did not identify ratFwe2 in SVs purified from rat brain [53], our biochemical analyses show that ratFwe2 is indeed associated with the membrane of SVs. Our data show that 4% of the total endogenous Fwe channels efficiently promotes CME and ADBE at the Drosophila NMJ. If a single SV needs at least one functional Fwe channel complex during exo–endo coupling, and one functional Fwe complex comprises at least four monomers, similar to VGCCs, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V members (TRPV) 5 and 6, and calcium release-activated channel (CRAC)/Orai1 [24,40,54,55], then we anticipate that each SV contains ~100 Fwe proteins (4 monomers × 25). This suggests that Fwe is highly abundant on the SVs. It is unlikely that many SVs do not have the Fwe, as a 25-fold reduction of the protein is enough to ensure functional integrity during repetitive neurotransmission. Finally, our results for the SypHy and dextran uptake assays at mammalian central synapses indicate the functional conservation of the Fwe channel in promoting different modes of SV retrieval. In summary, the Fwe-mediated exo–endo coupling seems to be of broad importance for sustained synaptic transmission across species.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nDetailed protocols are available at protocols.io (http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.hgbb3sn).\n\nDrosophila strains and genetics\n\nMost of the experiments used y w; FRT80B isogenized fly, which was used for the generation of the fweDB25 and fweDB56 mutations [56] as the controls.

To obtain the pUAST-flag-mFwe2-HA construct, the fwe-RB fragment of the pUAST-flag-fwe-RB-HA construct [24] was replaced with the mFwe2 coding region, which was amplified from total mRNA of the adult mouse brain. P-element-mediated transgenesis was achieved by the standard procedure. The introduction of these genomic fwe transgenes to the fwe mutant background rescues the early lethality associated with fwe mutants, demonstrating that fused tags do not affect normal functions of Fwe. To generate the mFwe-miRNAi constructs, the sequences of miRNAs were designed according to Invitrogen’s RNAi Designer. mFwe-miRNAi-1 targets nucleotides 183–203 of the mFwe2 coding sequence (forward oligomer: TGCTGAAGG CGTTCATGATCATCCACGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACGTGGATGAATGAACGCCTT; reverse oligomer: CCTGAAGGCGTTCATTCATCCACGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACGTGG ATGATCATGAACGCCTTC). mFwe-miRNAi-2 targets nucleotides 236–256 of the mFwe2 coding sequence (forward oligomer: TGCTGTTG CAAACTCCACAAACTGGCGTTTTGGC CACTGACTGACGCCAGTTTGGAGTTTGCAA; reverse oligomer: CCTGTTGCAAACTCC AAACTGGCGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACGCCAGTTTGTGGAGTTTGCAAC). Synthetic oligomers were annealed and subcloned to pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFPmiR vector (Invitrogen). To generate the pSpCas9(BB)-based plasmids, pSpCas9(BB)-2A-tagRFP was constructed by replacing the GFP region of the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP plasmid (addgene#48138) [43] with a TagRFP coding sequence. m/ratFwe-gRNA was designed to target the first intron/second exon junction of the mFwe and ratFwe (forward oligomer: CACCGTTTGAAGCCTGTGCCATCTC; reverse oligomer: TTTGCTCTACCGTGTCCGAAG TTTG). Annealed synthetic oligomers were placed into the BbsI site of pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP and pSpCas9(BB)-2A-tagRFP to obtain pSpCas9(BB)-m/ratFwe-gRNA-2A-GFP and pSpCas9(BB)-m/ratFwe-gRNA-2A-tagRFP constructs. pSpCas9(BB)-m/ratFwe-gRNA-2A-GFP-2A-mFwe2-HA and pSpCas9(BB)-m/ratFwe-gRNA-2A-tagRFP-2A-mFwe2-HA were generated by inserting the DNA fragment of 2A-mFwe2-HA, which was amplified by PCR with the primers (forward primer: AAAAGCTTGGCAGTGGAGAGGGCAGAGGAAGTCTGCTAACATGCGGTGACGTCG AGGAGAATCCTGGCCCAAGCGGCTCGGGCGCC; reverse primer: CCCTCGAGTTA CGCGTAGTCGGGGAC), after GFP or tagRFP.\n\nReverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)\n\nTotal RNA of different regions of the adult rat brain were extracted with TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of total RNA was mixed with oligo-dT primer in 20 μl of reverse transcription reaction solution. One μl of this mixture was used to amplify the cDNA of ratFwe2 mRNA with specific primers (forward primer: GAAGATCTATGAGCGGCTCGGTCGCC; reverse primer: CGGAATTCTCACAGTTCCCCCTCGAATG). Twenty-five PCR cycles were used to allow exponential PCR amplification. The PCR products were sequenced to validate the identity of ratFwe2 mRNA.\n\nAntibody generation\n\nGST-fused polypeptides comprising seven tandem repeats of the C-terminus of Drosophila Fwe-PB isoform [24] were injected in guinea pigs to obtain GP100Y antisera. To generate α-m/ratFwe2 antisera (GP67), the DNA fragment encoding seven tandem repeats of ratFwe2 C-terminus (a.a. 140–172) was subcloned to pET28a plasmid. His-fused polypeptides were purified and then injected into guinea pigs. Antibody generation was assisted by LTK BioLaboratories (Taiwan). Specific antibodies were further purified by antigen-conjugated affinity columns.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nFor immunostaining in fly NMJ boutons, larval fillets were dissected in ice-cold 1X PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100-containing 1X PBS solution for all staining, except staining with anti-Fwe (GP100Y) and anti-HA antibodies, which used 0.1% Tween-20-containing 1X PBS solution to prevent Fwe dissociation from the SVs. Primary antibody dilutions used mouse anti-Dlg (mAb 4F3) [57], 1:100 (Hybridoma bank) [58]; mouse anti-Brp (nc82), 1:100 (Hybridoma bank) [59]; rabbit anti-GFP, 1:500 (Invitrogen); mouse monoclonal anti-HA, 1:200 (Sigma); rabbit anti-HA, 1:200 (Sigma); rabbit Cy3 conjugated anti-HRP, 1:500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch); and guinea pig anti-Fwe-PB (GP100Y), 1:100. Secondary antibodies were diluted to 1:500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Invitrogen). For immunostaining of cultured rat hippocampal neurons, DIV14 neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized and washed with 0.1% Tween-20-containing 1X PBS solution. To reduce nonspecific staining, GP67 antibodies were absorbed with paraformaldehyde-fixed n2a cells before staining. Primary antibody dilutions used rabbit anti-GFP, 1:500 (Invitrogen); guinea pig ant-m/ratFwe2 (GP67), 1:100; rabbit anti-GM130, 1:500 (Adcam); mouse anti-HA, 1:200 (Sigma); and mouse anti-SVP38, 1:200 (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were diluted to 1:500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Invitrogen). DAPI was used in the 1:2,000 dilution (Invitrogen). To compare the staining intensity of boutons among different genotypes, larval fillets used in the same graph were stained in the same Eppendorf tube. The images were captured using a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope, and the scan setup was fixed for the same experimental set. For data quantifications, single-plane confocal images were projected. The final staining intensity in boutons was calculated by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity in the surrounding muscles from the staining intensity in boutons. The staining intensities of all type Ib boutons from the same muscles 6 and 7 in one image were averaged to obtain each data value. Image processing was achieved using LSM Zen and Image J.\n\nGeneration of mFwe knockout neuroblastoma n2a cells\n\nMouse neuroblastoma n2a cells were transfected with pSpCas9(BB)-m/ratFwe-gRNA-2A-GFP plasmid. GFP-positive cells were sorted out using flow cytometry, and the cells were plated in a 96-well plate in which each well included approximately one cell. After 3-wk culture, single cell-driven colonies were subjected to immunostaining and immunoblotting for mFwe2 to verify the knockout of mFwe2. One of the confirmed mFwe knockout neuroblastoma n2a cell lines was used in S9A Fig.\n\nFractionation and western blotting\n\nFor western blotting of n2a cell lysates, the cells lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) were boiled in 1X SDS sample buffer for 10 min. To prepare subcellular fractions of adult rat brain, one adult brain (~1 g) was homogenized in 5 ml 0.32 M sucrose buffer (320 mM sucrose, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5]) using a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenates (H) were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at 4°C to yield pellets (P1) and supernatants (S1). S1 supernatants were centrifuged at 9,200 × g for 15 min at 4°C to obtain pellets (P2) and supernatants (S2), which were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C to obtain fractions of cytosol (S3) and light membrane (P3). The pellets (P2) were then lysed in ice-cold Mini-Q water, followed by equilibration with 4 mM HEPES. After 30-min mixing at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to yield the crude synaptic vesicle fraction (LS1) and lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1). The LS1 fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain crude synaptic vesicles (LP2) and the synaptosomal cytosol fraction (LS2). A discontinuous sucrose gradient from 0.3–0.99 M was prepared by gradually layering the different concentrations of sucrose. The S1 supernatants were loaded on sucrose gradient solution and centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 3 h at 4°C. Fractions were collected from low- to high-density sucrose. These fractions were boiled in 1X SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The primary antibody dilutions used were as follows: guinea pig anti-m/ratFwe2 (GP67), 1:500; rabbit anti-SVP38, 1:1,000 (Sigma); rabbit anti-GM130, 1:5,000 (Abcam); mouse anti-Tubulin, 1: 10,000 (Sigma); and mouse anti-α-Actin, 1:10,000 (Sigma). Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were diluted to 1:5,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).\n\nFM1-43 dye uptake\n\nTo induce CME, the third instar larvae were dissected in 0 mM Ca2+ hemolymph-like (HL)-3 solution at room temperature (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], and 115 mM sucrose) [60] and subjected to 1-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ stimulation (25 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 30 mM sucrose, and 0.5 mM CaCl2) or 10-min 60 mM K+/1 mM Ca2+ stimulation (55 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 30 mM sucrose, and 1 mM CaCl2) in the presence of 4 μM fixable FM1-43 (Invitrogen). Excess dye was extensively washed with 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution for 10 min. Larval fillets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed, mounted, and imaged on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope. The scan setup was fixed for all the sets of the experiments. For data quantifications, single-plane confocal images were projected, and the final FM1-43 dye intensity in the boutons was calculated by subtracting the dye fluorescence intensity in the surrounding muscles from the dye fluorescence intensity within the boutons. The dye fluorescence intensities of all type Ib boutons from the same muscles 6 and 7 were averaged to obtain each data value. For chlorpromazine treatment experiment, dissected larvae were incubated with 200 μM chlorpromazine (Sigma) in Schneider medium for 30 min. They were then stimulated with a solution of 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+/200 μM chlorpromazine (25 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 30 mM sucrose, 2 mM CaCl2, and 200 μM chlorpromazine) in the presence of 4 μM fixable FM1-43 for 10 min. Bulk membranous invaginations were defined as the internalized structures labeled with high levels of FM1-43 dye. The areas of individual type Ib boutons and bulk membranous invaginations were measured using Image J. For FM1-43 dye loading/unloading assays, larvae were dissected in 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution at room temperature and subjected to a stimulation of 90 mM K+/0.5 (or 2) mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution for 5 min to load boutons with the FM1-43 dye. Excess dye was removed by extensive washing with 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution for 10 min. FM1-43 dye uptake by boutons was imaged to indicate “loading.” Subsequently, the dye loaded in SVs was unloaded by stimulation using 90 mM K+/0.5 (or 2) mM Ca2+ solution for 1 min. Released dye was removed by several washes with a 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution. The remaining dye in boutons was imaged to indicate “unloading.” The final FM1-43 dye intensity in the boutons was calculated by subtracting the dye fluorescence intensity in the surrounding muscles from the dye fluorescence intensity within the boutons. The dye fluorescence intensities of at least ten type Ib boutons from the same muscles 6 and 7 were averaged to obtain each data value. The dye unloading efficiency was indicated as (Fload-Funload)/Fload. Images processing was achieved using Image J and LSM Zen.\n\nCa2+ imaging\n\nGCaMP6f imaging\n\nThe third instar larvae were dissected in 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 at room temperature and incubated in 2 mM Ca2+/5 mM K+/7 mM glutamate solution (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 115 mM sucrose, 2 mM CaCl2, and 7 mM monosodium glutamate). Glutamate treatment would desensitize postsynaptic glutamate receptors, thus reducing muscle contraction upon stimulation. GCaMP6f fluorescence was then measured to indicate the resting Ca2+ levels. To image GCaMP6f in high K+ stimulations, larval fillets were subsequently stimulated with 90 mM K+/2 mM Ca2+/7 mM glutamate solution. High K+ and Ca2+ lead to bulk Ca2+ influxes into the muscles and cause dramatic contractions. The boutons were manually focused and simultaneously imaged in the 6th and 10th min every 1 s. After 10-min stimulation, larval fillets were rinsed with 2 mM Ca2+/5 mM K+/7 mM glutamate solution and imaged again. Similarly, boutons subjected to 1-min 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+/7 mM glutamate stimulation were manually focused and imaged between 30–60 s every 1 s. All images were captured from muscles 6 and 7 of abdominal segment 3. Each larva was only used for one recording. The images of clearly focused boutons were further used for data quantifications. The GCaMP6f fluorescence intensities in type Ib boutons and the surrounding muscles (served as the fluorescence background) were measured. Final GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity was calculated by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity in the surrounding muscles from the GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity in the boutons. The GCaMP6f fluorescence intensities of at least ten type Ib boutons from the same muscles 6 and 7 at a given time period were averaged to obtain each data value. For electric stimulation, the larval axonal bundle was aspirated and delivered with 10–40 Hz stimulations via a glass capillary electrode. The stimulus was fixed at 5 mV and 0.5 ms duration by pClamp 10.6 software (Axon Instruments). The images were captured every 2 s using MetaMorph software and an ANDOR iXon3 897 camera. All images were captured from muscles 6 and 7 of abdominal segment 3. Each larva was only used for one recording. The GCaMP6f fluorescence intensities in type Ib boutons and the surrounding muscles (which served as the fluorescence background) were measured. The final GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity was calculated by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity in the surrounding muscles from the GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity in the boutons. The GCaMP6f fluorescence intensities of at least five type Ib boutons from the same muscles 6 and 7 at a given time period were averaged to obtain each data value. Images processing was achieved using Image J and LSM Zen.\n\nCa2+ imaging in salivary glands\n\nBriefly, the gland cells of the third instar larvae were dissected in 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution. The cells were subjected to loading of 4 μM Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) in 100 μM Ca2+ solution. For La3+ treatment, the cells were incubated in 100 μM LaCl3/100 μM Ca2+ solution. The images were captured every 10 min during dye loading using MetaMorph software and an ANDOR iXon 897 camera. The fluorescence intensities in the salivary gland cells and surrounding cover slips were measured. The final fluorescence value was calculated by subtracting the fluorescence intensity in the gland cells from the dye fluorescence intensity in the coverslips. The fluorescence intensity of one salivary gland was used for each data value. Image processing was achieved using Image J and LSM Zen.\n\nElectrophysiology\n\nThe third instar larvae were dissected in 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 at room temperature and then bathed in 1 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution for 5–10 min before the recording. The mean value of the resistance of the recording electrode was ~40 MΩ when the electrode was filled with a 3M KCl solution. All recordings were obtained from muscle 6 of abdominal segment 3. Each larva was only used for one recording. Recordings from the muscles that hold resting membrane potentials at less than −60 mV were used for further data quantifications. EJPs were evoked by stimulating the axonal bundle via a glass capillary electrode with an internal diameter of ~10–15 μm (Harvard Apparatus Glass Capillaries GC120F-15) at 0.2 Hz. Stimulus pulses were fixed at 0.5 ms duration (pClamp 10.6 software, Axon Instruments). To obtain maximal EJP amplitude, 3–5 mV electric stimuli were applied. EJPs were amplified with an Axoclamp 900A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California) under bridge mode and filtered at 10 kHz. EJPs were analyzed by pClamp 10.6 software (Axon Instruments). For the EJP amplitude at 0.2 Hz, the mean of the EJP amplitude was averaged from the amplitudes of 80 EJPs in one consecutive recording.\n\nTEM\n\nLarval fillets were dissected in 0 mM Ca2+ HL-3 medium at room temperature. To trigger CME, samples were stimulated with 90 mM K+/0.5 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution for 1 min or 60 mM K+/1 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution for 10 min. To induce ADBE, larval fillets were subjected to stimulation of a 90 mM K+/2 mM or 5 mM Ca2+ HL-3 solution in the presence or lack of 10 μM La3+ for 10 min. Subsequently, the samples were fixed for 12 h in 4% paraformaldehyde/1% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M cacodylic acid (pH 7.2) solution and then rinsed with 0.1 M cacodylic acid (pH 7.2) solution. They were subsequently fixed in 1% OsO4/0.1 M cacodylic acid solution at room temperature for 3 h. The samples were subjected to a series of dehydration from 30% to 100% ethanol. After 100% ethanol dehydration, the samples were incubated in propylene, a mixture of propylene and resin, and pure resin. Lastly, they were embedded in 100% resin. The images of type Ib boutons were captured using Tecnai G2 Spirit TWIN (FEI Company) and a Gatan CCD Camera (794.10.BP2 MultiScan) at ≥4,400 × magnifications. The size of the SVs and the bulk cisternae and the area of type Ib boutons were measured using Image J. We identified type Ib boutons by multiple layers of subsynaptic reticulum. The radius of the bulk cisternae was calculated from A(area) = πr2. Isolated membranous structures larger than 80 nm in diameter were defined as bulk cisternae.\n\nSypHy imaging and dextran uptake assays\n\nFor SypHy imaging, DIV7 cultured rat hippocampal neurons were transfected with pSpCas9(BB) and pCMV-SyphyA4 (addgene#24478) plasmids [5]. DIV13–15 neurons were bathed in the imaging buffer in a chamber (Warner instruments RC-25F) with two parallel platinum wires separated by 5 mm. The imaging buffer consisted of 136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 μM CNQX, and 50 μM AP-5. SV exocytosis was elicited with a train of 200 action potentials delivered with a 20-Hz electric field stimulation (50 mA, 1-ms pulse width). Single images were captured every 1 s using MetaMorph software and an ANDOR iXon 897 camera. The experiments were performed at either room or physiological temperatures controlled by a Warner temperature controller (TC-344B). For SV reacidification experiments, the imaging chamber was perfused with the imaging buffer (136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 10 μM CNQX, and 50 μM AP-5) before perfusion with an acidic buffer (136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM 2-[N-morpholino] ethane sulphonic acid [pH 5.5], 10 μM CNQX, and 50 μM AP-5), which was prepared by replacing HEPES in the imaging buffer with 2-[N-morpholino] ethane sulphonic acid [47,48]. Next, the imaging buffer was perfused to allow surface SypHy to be fluorescent. Experimental temperatures were maintained at physiological temperatures. The final SypHy fluorescence intensities in the presynaptic terminals were calculated by subtracting the background fluorescence intensity on the surrounding coverslip from the SypHy fluorescence intensity within presynaptic terminals. Each data value was obtained from a single terminal. For 40 kDa TMR-dextran uptake assays, DIV13–15 neurons transfected with pSpCas9(BB) plasmids were stimulated by a train of 1,600 action potentials delivered with an 80 Hz electric field stimulation (50 mA, 1-ms pulse width) in the imaging solution (144 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 μM CNQX, and 50 μM AP-5) [49] in the presence of 50 μM 40 kDa TMR-dextran (Invitrogen). Subsequently, neurons were perfused with the same buffer for 5 min to remove excess dextran dye. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Imaging was achieved through MetaMorph software and an ANDOR iXon 897 camera. Image processing was achieved using Image J and LSM Zen.\n\nStatistics\n\nPaired and multiple data sets were compared by Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA statistical analyses, respectively. All data analyses were achieved using GraphPad Prism 7.0. The numerical data used in all figures are included in S1 Data.\n\nSupporting information"
