  "fullText": "In S2 Fig., the second and third rows of firing rate maps in panel A are swapped and incorrectly labeled &quot;arena frame&quot; and &quot;room frame&quot; respectively. Instead, the second row should be labeled “room frame” and the third row should be labeled “arena frame”. Also, the spatial coherence numbers for the fourth row of firing rate maps in panel A were incorrectly duplicated from the first row. Please see the corrected S2 Fig. here.\n\nThe figure legend also omits the sentence “Spatial coherence is given below each firing rate map.” Please view the corrected figure and legend below.\n\nSupporting Information"
