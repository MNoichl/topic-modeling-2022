  "fullText": "Some panels of Figure 1 also appear in more complete form in Supplementary Figures S3 and S5. To clarify this, the authors have supplied a corrected version of the legend to Figure 1.\n\nThe authors inadvertently used the wrong EMSA gel in the central panel of Figure 4, resulting in a duplication. The right-hand panel (VosA1-190 K160A and VosA1-190 dead) was correct, but the central panel (VosA1-190 K37/39A, VosA1-190 R41A and VosA1-190 K42A) incorrectly showed the same gel. The authors have confirmed that this error does not affect the interpretation of the results or conclusions of the paper. The authors apologize for any confusion caused by this mistake. The authors have provided a corrected version here."
