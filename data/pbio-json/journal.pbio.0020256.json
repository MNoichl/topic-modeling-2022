The abbreviation FLJ was expanded incorrectly (as full-length long Japan) in the abbreviations list and in the first paragraph of the Results/Discussion section. FLJ stands for full-length cDNA Japan.\n\n2. In Table 1, the number of cDNAs and the number of library origins for two of the cDNA sources were incorrect. The correct numbers are as follows:"
