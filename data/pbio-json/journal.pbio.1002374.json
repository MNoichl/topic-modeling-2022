  "fullText": "There were some errors in the preparation of the middle panel of Fig 4 (which was an inadvertent duplication of Fig 2C), the middle and bottom panel of Fig 6B and the three panels in Fig 8A that were originally published in this article. These errors do not affect the conclusions of the article. The authors wish to correct these figures in order to demonstrate the reproducibility of data presented in Fig 4, Fig 6B and Fig 8A of this article. The authors present results from replicate experiments performed as independent confirmation of the published data (collected in 2007). The corrected data has been verified by the PLOS Biology Editors.\n\nThe corrected versions of Figs 4, 6 and 8 are included here."
