  "abstract": "Phytoplankton are key components of aquatic ecosystems, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and supporting secondary production, yet relatively little is known about how future global warming might alter their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functioning. Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4°C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nPhytoplankton fix CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and underpin the secondary production of many of the world’s aquatic ecosystems [1], yet the effects of global warming on their biodiversity (the number of distinct taxa in a given location) and productivity remains largely unknown. Temperature sets the pace of metabolism [2] and, consequently, a host of life history traits and attributes that determine fitness, including population growth rate, abundance, resource acquisition rate, mortality, and interspecific interactions [3–7]. Global warming could therefore substantially alter local phytoplankton biodiversity through its effects on ecological dynamics (e.g., competition, predation). For example, it could reduce local biodiversity by increasing metabolic rates (and hence resource demands) of individuals, resulting in competitive exclusion through increased resource competition. Alternatively, it could increase local biodiversity by magnifying effects of keystone- or frequency-dependent predation (e.g., where consumers switch between resources preferentially to predate upon the most abundant taxa), allowing inferior competitors to persist [8–10].\n\nTemperature-mediated effects on species coexistence have received relatively little attention and remain poorly understood (but see [9] for a notable exception). While the experiments conducted thus far suggest that phytoplankton biodiversity declines with increases in temperature [11–15], extrapolating to the field is challenging because these primarily laboratory-based experiments are conducted over relatively short time scales (e.g., weeks to months). Such experiments also cannot replicate several key ecological processes that influence local biodiversity dynamics in nature. For example, species turnover occurs in communities through ceaseless immigration and local extinction, the balance of which determines local biodiversity levels [16,17]. Laboratory experiments are disconnected from a regional species pool and exclude dynamics of dispersal-mediated community assembly, which are important for determining metacommunity structure [16]. In addition, such experiments cannot fully capture the material recycling processes that shape natural ecosystem succession [18]. The few experiments conducted in outdoor mesocosms, and which can account for metacommunity dynamics, have not investigated the effects of warming on patterns of biodiversity and species coexistence [19,20].\n\nIn contrast to laboratory experiments, eco-evolutionary species distribution models of the responses of phytoplankton biodiversity to ocean warming suggest net losses in the tropics and gains at the poles [21]. These models, however, ignore trophic interactions [21], which could play a central role in determining how warming affects competition and coexistence in phytoplankton communities [22]. These limitations, both in published experiments and in current theory, highlight important gaps in our understanding of how the biodiversity and productivity of phytoplankton communities might respond to global warming.\n\nWe used a long-term, outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of warming on the structure, biodiversity, and functioning of plankton communities. Our experimental approach differs in several fundamental ways from previous studies that have investigated the effects of warming on phytoplankton biodiversity [11–15]. First, our outdoor mesocosms are open to natural dispersal (aerial and/or transportation on mobile vertebrates) from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Second, because these mesocosms comprise both benthic and pelagic communities, they include fundamental material recycling processes and can recreate many of the salient biogeochemical features of natural aquatic ecosystems [23–26]. Finally, the mesocosms had been warmed for 5 yr at the time of sampling, allowing us to characterize biodiversity responses in the context of long-term successional and ecosystem dynamics over tens-of-thousands of generations for the phytoplankton.\n\nWe carried out a detailed empirical survey to assess how long-term experimental warming altered the structure, diversity, and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton communities. We then characterized how the biomass, size structure, and composition of the zooplankton (the consumers of the phytoplankton) were affected and determined the extent to which warming altered the functioning (e.g., gross primary production [GPP] and community respiration [CR]) of the plankton communities. Finally, we use these measurements, taken across multiple levels of organization (population, community, &amp; ecosystem) to explore the mechanisms that link the structure and dynamics of the plankton community to the ecosystem processes they mediate and the way in which warming altered the functioning of these ecosystems.\n\nResults\n\nPhytoplankton Diversity and Community Structure\n\nAverage taxonomic richness of the phytoplankton communities was 67% higher in the warmed mesocosms (Fig 1A; S1 Table). The Shannon Diversity Index also increased with warming (Fig 1B; S1 Table), as did rarefied richness (S3 Fig) and total biomass (Fig 1C; S1 Table), while total abundance was unaffected by warming (Fig 1D; S1 Table). These results demonstrate that the higher diversity of the warmed communities cannot be attributed to greater numbers of individuals.\n\nThe rank abundance distributions (RADs) of the phytoplankton communities for the warmed treatments were markedly flatter, with more equitable allocations of individuals among more taxa, compared to their ambient counterparts (Fig 2A). Parameter estimates from the Poisson log-normal fits (see Methods) also demonstrated that the standard deviation of log-abundance per taxon (σ) was lowest in the warmed treatments (Fig 2B; S1 Table), whereas the average of log-abundance per taxon (μ) did not differ between treatments (Fig 2C; S1 Table). Overall, these findings indicate that long-term warming altered patterns of dominance and diversity in these local communities.\n\nWarming also altered the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed a statistically significant separation in the taxonomic composition of the warmed and ambient treatments (Fig 3A; PERMANOVA; F1,15 = 3.75; p = 0.0019). These patterns could reflect deterministic [27,28] effects of temperature on mechanisms of community assembly, for example by altering optimal thermal niches or by changing species interactions. They could also simply reflect stochastic processes of colonisation and extinction [27,28], or a combination of both stochastic and deterministic factors [29]. To investigate the effects of warming on mechanisms of community assembly, we used a null-model approach [27,28] to ask: do patterns of β-diversity (i.e., pond-to-pond differences in taxonomic composition) deviate from those expected under a completely stochastic assembly process given the observed patterns of α- and γ-diversity (i.e., the “local” (one pond) and “regional” (all ponds) numbers of taxa, respectively)? We used the rescaled Raup-Crick metric (βRC), which varies from −1 (communities more similar than expected by chance) to 1 (communities more dissimilar than expected by chance) to quantify the relative roles of stochastic versus deterministic factors in driving metacommunity assembly in our experiment [28]. Values of βRC between ambient (z = −2.47, p = 0.019), warmed (z = −2.44, p = 0.013) and ambient-warmed (z = −5.86, p = 0.0009) comparisons were significantly lower (e.g., more similar) than expected by chance alone (Fig 3B), suggesting that deterministic factors dominated mechanisms of community assembly across the experiment.\n\nThe trait distributions of the phytoplankton communities also differed systematically between the warmed and ambient treatments. The latter were dominated by smaller, single-celled genera of algae—e.g., Chlamydomonas, Chlorella, Chromulina—while the former included larger, filamentous cyanobacteria and colonial algae—e.g., Anabaena, Spirogyra, and Chlamydocapsa. Average body masses were an order-of-magnitude higher in the warmed treatments (Fig 4B; S1 Table). Larger phytoplankton taxa, with diameters &gt; 35 μm, are generally considered less susceptible to predation, because they are too large to be handled effectively and consumed by zooplankton [30,31]. Correspondingly, the proportional abundances of these large, inedible phytoplankton taxa were significantly higher in the warmed treatments (S4 Fig; S1 Table).\n\nZooplankton Community Structure\n\nThe effects of warming on zooplankton community structure were far weaker than for the phytoplankton: neither total biomass nor average body mass differed significantly between warmed and ambient treatments (S1 Table; Figs 4C and 5A). The total biomass of cladocerans and copepods also did not differ between treatments (S1 Table; Fig 5B). However, further dividing the grazers into the dominant genera revealed some treatment effects, although these were subtle, and apparently compensatory: declines in the biomass of Diaptomus were partially compensated by increases in the biomass of Chydorus in the warmed treatments, while the biomass of Daphnia, Bosmina, Alona, and ostracods were not affected by warming (S5 Fig).\n\nEcosystem Functioning\n\nGross primary production (GPP) was higher in the warmed treatments, while rates of plankton CR did not differ significantly between treatments (Fig 6A; S1 Table). We used path analysis to test hypotheses about the direct and indirect interactions between warming, the structure of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and rates of ecosystem metabolism. In the best fitting model, CR was directly and positively correlated with temperature (Fig 6B). In contrast, warming increased GPP indirectly, because higher temperatures enhanced phytoplankton taxon richness, which in turn elevated levels of phytoplankton biomass and thus rates of GPP (Fig 6B). The best-fitting model also included positive direct effects of temperature on phytoplankton taxon richness (Fig 6). These findings demonstrate that warming altered ecosystem functioning both by directly enhancing metabolic rates (CR) and by indirectly changing the structure of the phytoplankton communities (impacting GPP).\n\nDiscussion\n\nWarming resulted in profound shifts in the organization and biodiversity of the local phytoplankton communities, increasing taxonomic richness by 67% (Fig 1). The distributions of abundance among taxa also became more even (Fig 2), and the taxonomic compositions and distributions of traits (e.g., body mass, edibility) were also altered markedly by warming (Fig 3 &amp; Fig 4). Rates of GPP and CR were elevated in the warmed treatments and path analysis revealed that warming both directly (by stimulating metabolic rates) and indirectly (by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the phytoplankton) influenced ecosystem functioning. These results demonstrate that ecological mechanisms that determine the number of species that can coexist locally could play an important role in mediating the effects of global warming on the biodiversity and functioning of primary producers in planktonic ecosystems.\n\nPrevious experiments have demonstrated that warming tends to reduce the mean body size, total biomass, and biodiversity of phytoplankton communities [14,32–34]. These findings have been attributed to greater competition among phytoplankton for limiting nutrients as a consequence of temperature-induced increases in rates of metabolism and resource uptake [33]. Small species, with high surface area-to-volume ratios and rapid growth rates, are at a selective advantage at high temperatures and low nutrient concentrations and consequently tend to dominate phytoplankton communities under these conditions [1]. Reductions in mean body size at the community level have been coined the “third universal response to global warming” [35,36]. Our results reveal the exact opposite pattern. Phytoplankton communities in the warmed treatments were more species rich, had greater evenness and standing stocks of biomass, and were dominated by larger species. So what mechanism(s) might explain these unexpected findings?\n\nExperimental warming of aquatic food webs tends to enhance top-down regulation of adjacent trophic levels [37–41] by increasing temperature-dependent consumption rates [5–7,42]. High consumption rates can enhance species coexistence when they are frequency-dependent [9,10] and such active prey-switching to target the most abundant resource has been demonstrated for zooplankton [43,44]. It is widely thought to be a key mechanism leading to stable coexistence among resource taxa when strategies leading to higher competitive ability also increase vulnerability to consumption by selective consumers [45–47]. Warming systematically shifted the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton towards taxa that are more resistant to grazing (Fig 4 &amp; S4 Fig), owing to larger cell size and/or colonial or filamentous growth form [30,48], suggesting stronger top-down control in the warmed treatments. The strength of interactions between consumers and resources increase as a function of the ratio in their body sizes [49] and the ambient temperature [7]. Recent theory predicts that as community assembly dynamics approach immigration–extinction equilibria, consumer–resource body size ratios should converge towards those that are most stable [50]. Our experimental evidence is consistent with this expectation, because increases in the prevalence of large phytoplankton serve to decrease consumer-resource body size ratios (because zooplankton body size was unaffected by warming, see Fig 4C), thereby adding weak trophic interactions to the warmed food webs and counteracting the effects of temperature on interaction strengths by stimulating metabolism.\n\nWarming did not affect the composition, body mass, or biomass structure of the zooplankton. This seems surprising given the major changes observed in the phytoplankton communities. Warming shifted the phytoplankton communities towards large taxa, presumably as a response to selection for grazer-resistant morphology [30,48] owing to higher temperature-dependent consumption rates. The lack of a concomitant shift in zooplankton composition and/or size structure might simply reflect the absence of appropriate traits within the regional species pool. Daphnia spp. are among the largest zooplankton grazers in freshwater ecosystems and were the dominant taxon in both the ambient and warmed treatments (S5 Fig). It seems likely that larger taxa, which could track the order-of-magnitude increase in mean body size observed in the phytoplankton, were simply absent from the regional species pool. Nevertheless, the higher temperatures will have increased the metabolic demands of the zooplankton in the absence of any shifts in composition, body mass and biomass structure.\n\nPath analysis demonstrated that plankton CR was directly and positively correlated with temperature. By contrast, warming increased GPP indirectly, because higher temperatures enhanced phytoplankton taxon richness, which in turn elevated levels of phytoplankton biomass and thus rates of GPP (Fig 6B). This result suggests that after controlling for other correlated variables, heterotrophic metabolism (a proportion of CR) was more strongly affected by temperature than rates of autotrophic metabolism (GPP), in line with previous findings in both freshwater and marine ecosystems [25,37,51,52]. Thus, if elevated metabolic rates are correlated with higher consumption rates by heterotrophs, then this once again points towards an increase in the strength of top-down control in the warmed treatments.\n\nThe results presented here for the long-term effects of warming on the structure and diversity of phytoplankton contrast sharply with those seen during the first year of this experiment [32] and provide further clues as to the mechanisms responsible for the observed patterns. At the onset of the experiment, the planktivorous fish, Rutilus rutilus was added to the mesocosms, but due to poor survivorship, they were removed from all mesocosms at the end of the first year of warming (see Materials and Methods). During the first year of warming, in the presence of the planktivore, genus richness, Shannon-Diversity, and mean body mass of the phytoplankton were all significantly reduced in the warmed treatments, while total abundance increased [33,53] (see S8 Fig). The differential response of the phytoplankton communities in the presence and absence of the fish suggest that warming interacts strongly with the trophic cascade in planktonic communities. When fish are present, their effect on zooplankton releases the phytoplankton from strong, warming-induced, top-down control, resulting in increased interspecific competition for nutrients and selection for small but edible organisms, which are good competitors for nutrients [33,53]. Conversely, when fish are absent, warming increases the strength of top-down control of zooplankton on the phytoplankton, which relaxes interspecific competition for nutrients and favors large and inedible taxa, which are inferior competitors for nutrients, and increases diversity.\n\nThe overall weight of experimental evidence (e.g., flatter species abundance distributions, shifts in the taxonomic composition and trait distributions of the phytoplankton towards large colonial or filamentous algae, elevated biomass specific rates of respiration) points towards increases in top-down control, leading to suppression of competitive exclusion and greater species coexistence as the most likely explanation for the increased biodiversity and productivity of the phytoplankton under long-term warming. This is supported by a null model analysis, which demonstrated that deterministic processes dominated mechanisms of community assembly in the phytoplankton, and a path analysis of the variables representing the structure and functioning of the plankton communities. However, without directly manipulating the grazers, we cannot isolate this as the only mechanism driving the shifts in community structure and function in the warmed treatments. Irrespective of the ultimate mechanism, however, our findings demonstrate that in open systems, where local extinctions can be counterbalanced by dispersal-mediated immigration from the regional species pool (e.g., metacommunity dynamics), warming could actually lead to increases (as well as decreases) in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, in contrast to the received wisdom based on laboratory experiments in closed systems [11–15].\n\nTaken together, our results emphasize the fundamental role temperature plays in constraining patterns of species coexistence and dominance in local communities. They also suggest that warming can alter ecosystem functioning indirectly, by shifting community structure and biodiversity, in addition to its well-known direct effects mediated by metabolism [2]. The findings we report are significant because they show that temperature can enhance the diversity of local communities through ecological mechanisms. Moreover, they mirror biodiversity patterns reported for aquatic and terrestrial taxa along broadscale gradients of temperature and latitude [54]. Latitudinal biodiversity gradients are typically attributed to long-term macroevolutionary and/or historical mechanisms [55]; however, our findings, which isolate the effects of temperature while controlling for other variables that may be confounded along latitudinal gradients (e.g., nutrients, productivity, disturbance regime), suggest that temperature may in part influence local biodiversity through its effects on ecological mechanisms of species coexistence. Through such mechanisms, future global warming could, in some cases, actually enhance species richness and primary productivity in phytoplankton communities.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nExperimental Design\n\nThe outdoor mesocosm experiment (see S9 Fig) is based at the Freshwater Biological Association’s River Laboratory (2°10`W, 50°13`N) in East Stoke, Dorset, United Kingdom. Twenty artificial ponds, each holding 1 m3 of water, were set up to mimic–shallow standing freshwater ecosystems. The pool of species available for initial colonization was standardized at the outset by seeding all of the ponds in December 2005 with a “common garden” inoculum of organisms from surrounding freshwater habitats. Ponds were then left open to natural colonization and dispersal. Populations of an introduced planktivorous fish, R. rutilus, were maintained at constant densities (two individuals (age 1+) per mesocosm (~12 g C m−3)) in all mesocosms until October 2007. R. rutilus populations were removed in October 2007 by electrofishing due to ongoing poor survival. Experimental warming began in September 2006 [25] and had run for 5 yr (including 4 yr without fish) at of the onset of sampling in July 2011.\n\nTen of the twenty ponds were warmed 3–5°C above ambient temperature (see S1 Fig), in accordance with the IPCC A1B global warming projections for the next 100 yr for temperate northern hemisphere regions [56]. Mesocosms were warmed by an electronic heating element connected to a thermocouple, which was used to monitor the temperature in a given pair of warmed and ambient mesocosms. Over the 5-yr experiment, temperatures were logged every 5 min, and minor adjustments were made, if required, to ensure that temperature differences between treatments were ~4°C; the mean annual temperature difference between treatments over the year of sampling was 4.4°C ± SE 0.03 (S1 Fig). During the second year of the experiment, the heating elements in two of the warmed ponds malfunctioned. We therefore removed these replicates from the experiment, as well as the ambient replicates to which they were paired. All analyses presented here are on the 16 remaining replicates (8 warmed; 8 ambient).\n\nAbiotic Variables\n\nWater temperature was, as expected, significantly elevated in the warmed treatments (S1 Table; S1 Fig). By contrast, total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (S2 Fig) and orthophosphate (S2 Fig) were, on average, statistically indistinguishable between the warmed and ambient treatments over the annual cycle (S1 Table). Taken together, these two results show that of the variables we measured, temperature was the principal abiotic variable altered by experimental warming.\n\nPlankton Sampling\n\nThe plankton community from each of the 16 mesocosms was sampled every two months between July 2011 and July 2012 (7 sampling occasions in total). The entire water column from the sediment surface to the water surface was sampled using a 0.8 m-length tube sampler (Volume: 2 L), which was positioned at random in each mesocosm on each sampling date. Each sample was divided into two size categories (&gt;100 μm, &lt;100 μm) for preservation and subsequent analyses, via filtration through a 100 μm aperture sieve: organisms &gt;100 μm were preserved in 4% Formalin, and a 100 mL subsample of organisms &lt;100 μm was preserved in 1% Lugol’s iodine.\n\nPhytoplankton &lt;100 μm were counted using a LEICA DMIRB inverted microscope at 400x magnification, following the Utermöhl method [57]. The microscope was connected to an interactive image analysis system (LEICA EC3 camera and LAS software) to allow for a higher magnification. For each sample, at least 400 individuals (single cell, colony or filament) were counted, measured, and identified. Counts were converted to volumetric estimates of abundance (organisms mL−1) based on the volume of sample analyzed, which varied between 1 and 25 mL depending on the density of organisms. In total, 171 taxa were identified, 85% of which were identified to species level; the remaining 15% were identified to genus or class, or were undetermined (see S4 Table).\n\nPlankton &gt;100 μm (typically zooplankton) were counted, measured, and identified using a Nikon SMZ1500 dissection microscope. Of the six most dominant zooplankton taxa, which together accounted for 91% of the total zooplankton biomass, five were identified to genus level and one to class. This group included the key cladoceran and copepod genera (e.g., Daphnia spp., Bosmina spp., Chydorus spp., Alona spp., Diaptomus spp.) as well as the ostracods, which are important planktonic grazers in lakes [58]. The remaining taxa were identified to the highest possible taxonomic level, typically class or family.\n\nLinear dimensions of each individual were determined using image analysis. The “size” of each organism was expressed in units of carbon mass (μg C). To estimate masses of organisms &gt;100 μm (typically zooplankton), biovolumes were first determined by assigning organisms to geometric shapes that closely represented the real shape of the organism [59]. Masses were then calculated by converting biovolume to fresh weight using a factor of 1.1 g mL−1 and converting fresh weight to carbon content assuming a dry:wet weight ratio of 0.25 and a dry carbon content of 40% [59]. To estimate masses of organisms &lt;100 μm (typically phytoplankton), biovolumes were estimated by assigning organisms to matching geometric shapes [60]. For all phytoplankton individuals, biovolume was estimated by considering the linear dimensions of the whole organism, this included single cells (e.g., Chlorella), entire filaments (e.g., Anabaena planctonica), and colonies along with their mucilage (e.g., Aphanothece, Chlamydocapsa, Nephrocytium, Sphaerocystis) [60]. Biovolume was then converted to carbon units following Montagnes et al. [61]. In total, &gt;83,000 organisms, including both phytoplankton and zooplankton, were measured and identified.\n\nPlanktonic and Benthic Metabolism\n\nOn four of the seven sampling occasions (May, July, September, November) spanning the main growing season, we measured in situ rates of planktonic and benthic CR and GPP in each mesocosm. At midday, on each of the sampling occasions, we incubated samples of 0.5 L of the pelagic plankton community of each pond in custom-made paired clear and opaque polycarbonate chambers. At the same time, benthic communities were incubated in custom-made paired clear and opaque bottomless chambers that were screwed into the sediment to a depth of approximately 5 cm [62]. Both the pelagic and benthic chambers were equipped with magnetic stirrers (rotating at 300 rpm) to ensure even mixing within the chamber and with a Unisense OX50 microelectrode to measure the net production or consumption of O2 over a 30-min incubation period. Net community production (NCP) was measured as the change in O2 concentration in the clear chamber, while CR was the change in O2 in the opaque chamber. The concentration of O2 was measured every minute, and the rate of metabolism (NCP or CR) was determined as the slope of a linear regression between O2 (μmol O2 L−1 – pelagic; μmol O2 m−2 – benthic) and time (h). GPP (μmol O2 L−1) was estimated as the sum of the NCP and CR terms for both the pelagic and benthic zones, taking the appropriate chamber volumes and sediment surface areas into account.\n\nNutrient Analyses\n\nWater samples for measuring dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations were collected from mid-depth in each mesocosm at 9:00 a.m. on each sampling occasion. Samples were filtered (Whatmann GF/F) and stored frozen at −20°C for subsequent determination of NO3−, NO2−, NH4+, and orthophosphate (HPO42− + PO43−) using a segmented flow auto-analyzer (Skalar, San++, Breda, Netherlands) [63].\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nAssessing treatment effects on abiotic and biotic variables\n\nThe effects of warming on abiotic (temperature, nutrients) and biotic variables (including phytoplankton taxon richness, diversity, abundance and biomass) were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA, fitting treatment (two levels: warmed and ambient) as a fixed effect, and mesocosm (16 levels) and sampling month (7 in total) as random effects on the intercept. All ANOVA models were fitted using the function “lmer” in the “lme4” package for R statistical software [64]. Significance of the effect of warming was assessed using a likelihood ratio test by fitting nested models with and without the treatment variable using the maximum-likelihood method, and then comparing the two models using a likelihood ratio test (details given in S1 Table). Parameter estimates were obtained by refitting models using restricted maximum likelihood, as recommended in Zuur et al. [65]. Response variables (described below) were log10 transformed prior to analysis when they did not conform to a normal distribution.\n\nWe assessed the effects of warming on the diversity of phytoplankton communities by submitting phytoplankton taxon richness and Shannon diversity to repeated measures ANOVA, as described above, using diversity estimates for each mesocosm on each of the seven sampling occasions. We also compared the RADs of warmed and ambient phytoplankton communities from each of the sampling months. Species-abundance data were fitted to the Poisson log-normal distribution using maximum-likelihood fitting implemented with the “mle2” function in the “bbmle” package in R statistical software [64]. Samples with less than three taxa (n = 12) were dropped from the analysis because the data were insufficient for model fitting. We used the two fitted parameters of the Poisson log-normal distribution (μ and σ) as metrics of the average log-taxon abundance and the relative evenness of the distribution of log-abundances among taxa, respectively, and submitted these variables to repeated measures ANOVA to test for the effect of treatment.\n\nAbundance and biomass-related response variables submitted to repeated measures ANOVA included total phytoplankton abundance and biomass, mean phytoplankton body mass, mean zooplankton body mass, and total biomass estimates of the key zooplankton functional groups—e.g., copepods, cladocerans, ostracods—and selected zooplankton genera, which were the main grazers in our experiment (Daphnia, Bosmina, Chydorus, Alona, Diaptomus).\n\nEffects of warming on phytoplankton community composition were assessed using two metrics. The first—proportional abundance of inedible phytoplankton—was used as a potential indicator of predation pressure [30]. Following Litchman et al. [30], we defined inedible taxa as those with greatest axial linear dimensions (GALDs) &gt; 35 μm, because they are too large to be handled effectively and consumed by zooplankton. The second—a taxonomic composition metric—was indexed as the “score” for each mesocosm along the first axis of a NMDS ordination. NMDS ordination was conducted using the “metaMDS” function in the “vegan” package in R [64] based on a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix derived from log10 (x + 1)-transformed total abundances of the taxa in each mesocosm pooled across the seven sampling months. NMDS projected this matrix into a new coordinate space with a small number of dimensions (in this case, two) while preserving the original Bray–Curtis dissimilarities among samples to the extent possible. Orthogonal rotation was applied to the axes in this new coordinate space so as to maximize the variance in “scores” among samples along the first NMDS axis. Thus, samples with more similar scores along the first NMDS axis are more similar to each other with respect to the dominant gradient in taxonomic composition. Finally, we used Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) to test whether Bray–Curtis dissimilarities between warmed and ambient treatments were significant [66].\n\nTo determine the dominant mechanisms of community assembly, we analyzed patterns of β-diversity (e.g., pond-to-pond dissimilarity in taxonomic composition) across the experimental metacommunity. We used a null-model approach to determine the relative influence of stochastic versus deterministic processes in constraining patterns of community assembly [27,28]. Because α-, β-, and γ-diversity covary [27,28], warming may influence β-diversity simply because it increases or decreases the ratio of α- to γ-diversity, which would imply community assembly patterns arise simply through stochastic sampling of regional species pool (defined as the cumulative richness across all ponds and all treatments). Alternatively, if β-diversity is higher or lower than expected by random sampling alone (given the observed patterns of α- and γ-diversity), this would support the importance of deterministic community assembly.\n\nWe assessed whether long-term experimental warming influenced the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes on community assembly using a recently developed null-model approach [27,28], which has been used in the past to interpret a range of diversity correlates, e.g., productivity [67], keystone predation [68], and disturbance [69]. Applying this approach involved simulating taxonomic assemblages in each mesocosm by randomly sampling from the regional species pool while preserving the taxon richness in each mesocosm (i.e., its α-diversity) and the relative occupancy of taxa across the metacommunity (i.e., the probability of a taxon’s occurrence, was weighted by their relative occupancy in the metacommunity) to generate an estimate of the β-diversity expected based solely on stochastic assembly processes [27,28]. Expected β-diversity for each pairwise combination of ponds on each sampling occasion was then calculated as the mean across 104 iterations of the null model. We then tested whether the observed β-diversity differed significantly from that predicted by the simulations from the null model (i.e., expected β-diversity) for warmed and ambient ponds using the “oecosimu” function in the “vegan” package for R [64]. We rejected the null hypothesis of no difference between observed and expected β-diversity if the observed β-diversity was outside the 95% confidence interval of the simulated values. Finally, we calculated the rescaled Raup-Crick metric (βRC) to quantify the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic factors in driving metacommunity assembly in our experiment [28]. A βRC value of zero would indicate a dominant role for stochastic assembly mechanisms, whereas values approaching −1 indicate that communities are more similar than expected by chance, while those close to 1 suggest communities are more dissimilar than expected by chance alone.\n\nBiotic and Abiotic Controls on Ecosystem Functioning\n\nWe used path analysis (a variant of structural equation modeling that uses only observed variables) to determine the extent to which warming altered ecosystem functioning directly, by stimulating rates of metabolism, or indirectly, by also altering the biomass and diversity of the plankton communities. Path analysis is a useful tool for studying complex biological systems, because it allows the user to link together component models for different response variables, enabling estimation of direct and indirect effects as well as the overall fit of a complex causal network of influence [70]. Because our experimental design resulted in hierarchical data, with multiple measurements of variables made seasonally, nested within replicate mesocosms, we used Shipley’s method of building a multilevel path model using directional separation tests [71]. This approach entailed assembling a path model as a set of hierarchical linear mixed effects models, each of which included hypothesized relationships between a response variable and a set of predictors as fixed effects and mesocosm ID as a random effect on the intercept. Each mixed effects model was fitted using the “lme” function in the “nlme” package, and the overall path model combining models for each response variable was fit using the “piecewiseSEM” package in R [72]. The predictors included temperature as an exogenous variable (i.e., whose variance arise outside of the model) and GPP, CR, phytoplankton taxon richness, phytoplankton biomass, and zooplankton biomass as endogenous variables (i.e., those whose variance the model seeks to explain). All variables were natural-log transformed (except for temperature) and standardized using the mean to linearize relationships and reduce correlations between the coefficients.\n\nWe hypothesized that warming both directly stimulated rates of GPP and CR by simply increasing metabolic rates and indirectly influenced these fluxes by altering the richness and biomass of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. We developed a set of candidate models, starting with a full model, which included all feasible paths between variables (see S7 Fig). All paths between variables were treated as “free parameters”, and their direction and magnitude were estimated from the observed data by the model. We then removed paths to generate a set of candidate models and selected among models with two criteria. First, we used Shipley’s test for directional separation, which combines the significance of unrealized paths into a single Chi-squared distributed Fisher’s C statistic as a measure of goodness of fit [71]. For each candidate model that passed this test of adequate fit (e.g., p &gt; 0.05), we computed a small sample-size corrected AIC score (AICc) [73]. We then compared between models by calculating delta AICc values and AIC weights (S2 Table). The relative importance of paths in the final model were compared using standardized coefficients, which are dimensionless and express a percentage change in the observed range of the response as the predictor increases across its range.\n\nSupporting Information"
