  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nThe development of T lymphocytes in the thymus involves a series of checkpoints, including T cell receptor (TCR)–mediated positive and negative selection. Positive selection ensures the selective survival of potentially useful T cells, whereas negative selection deletes harmful T cells, avoiding autoimmunity. Differential ligand–TCR interactions that result in positive and negative selection initiate differential intracellular signals that, in turn, lead to the survival-or-death decision of immature thymocytes [1–3]. The Bcl-2 family proteins are known to play crucial roles in regulating the survival and apoptosis of developing thymocytes. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, support the survival and development of T lymphocytes [4–6], whereas pro-apoptotic members, such as Bax, Bak, and Bim, essentially mediate the deletion of self-reactive thymocytes [7,\n\t\t\t\t8]. However, how the TCR signals result in the regulation of thymocyte fate by the Bcl-2 family members is unclear.\n\nTo better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate T-lymphocyte development and selection, an oligonucleotide microarray was screened for mouse cDNA that was highly expressed in positive-selector TCR-transgenic thymocytes. We found that \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 and \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 are expressed upon the positive selection of thymocytes. \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 and \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 belong to the recently discovered \n\t\t\t\tIAN (immune-associated nucleotide-binding protein)/\n\t\t\t\tGIMAP (GTPase of the immunity-associated protein) family of genes that encode functionally unknown GTP-binding proteins expressed in immune tissues [9–29]. It has been shown that \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 expression is predominant in the lymphoid cells, increased upon thymocyte maturation [9,\n\t\t\t\t10], and decreased in human T-leukemia cells [11], whereas the expression of mouse \n\t\t\t\tIAN2/\n\t\t\t\timap38 is elevated in the spleens of mice infected with the experimental malarial parasite \n\t\t\t\tPlasmodium chabaudi [12–14]. It has been also shown that \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 are highly expressed in leukemia cells in mouse and human, respectively [15,\n\t\t\t\t22], whereas human \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 inhibits the apoptosis induced by okadaic acid [21]. However, the function of the IAN family genes in lymphocyte development has been poorly characterized.\n\nThus far, the most conclusive results on the role of the IAN family members come from studies of the BB rat, an animal model for type I diabetes [16–20,\n\t\t\t\t25–27]. The BB rat spontaneously develops insulin-dependent diabetes and exhibits lifelong T lymphopenia in which the numbers of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are severely reduced [30,\n\t\t\t\t31]. Recent studies have identified a frame-shift mutation in \n\t\t\t\tIAN5, which is responsible for the T lymphopenia in the BB rat [16–20]. It has been further reported that \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 is involved in the regulation of T cell activation [25] and in the post-thymic development of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells [26]. These findings suggest that \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 plays an important role in the maintenance and regulation of peripheral T lymphocytes.\n\nThe present study shows that the mouse genome encodes eight functional IAN genes within a tight cluster, and that among the eight IAN family members, \n\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 are highly expressed in T lymphocytes, and their expression is significantly elevated in immature thymocytes upon TCR-mediated positive selection. Retroviral overexpression and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated knockdown in developing thymocytes indicate that \n\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 critically and differentially influence the survival and development of T lymphocytes. The knockdown of \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 disturbs thymocyte development at different stages, whereas the premature overexpression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 induces the apoptosis of immature thymocytes. It is further suggested that IAN4 and IAN5 are associated with anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, whereas IAN1 is associated with pro-apoptotic Bax. Importantly, Bcl-xL was found to interfere with the \n\t\t\t\tIAN5-mediated regulation of T cell survival. Taken together, these results indicate that the IAN family genes encode a novel family of TCR-responsive proteins that critically regulate the survival and death of developing T lymphocytes and that potentially do so via the association with Bcl-2 family proteins.\n\n      Results\n      \n        Mouse IAN Gene Cluster Encodes Eight Proteins with GTP-Binding Motifs\n        \nUsing oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we screened for mouse cDNA that was highly expressed in positive-selector \n\t\t\t\t\tH-2b\n\t\t\t\t\t AND-TCR–transgenic thymocytes [32]. In addition to previously characterized genes such as \n\t\t\t\t\tCCR7, we found that \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 were expressed at higher levels in the positive-selector thymocytes than in the wild-type thymocytes (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S1). In the mouse genome, eleven IAN genes were previously predicted to lie within a tight cluster on Chromosome 6 [17]. By analyzing the nucleotide sequences of BAC clones and PCR-amplified C57BL/6 genomic DNA, we identified mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN2, IAN3, IAN4, IAN5, IAN6, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN7 (Figure 1A), which were transcribed in immune tissues (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S1A). Provisional \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN8 was identified to be a pseudogene, because it had stop codons and multiple frame shifts in possible coding frames, and its transcript was undetected (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S1B). Provisional \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN9, IAN10, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN11 were transcribed and spliced into a single mRNA encoding a protein with three GTP-binding motifs (Figure 1B, \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S2), and thus renamed \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN9, in agreement with the recently described human \n\t\t\t\t\tgimap8 [28] and rat \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN9 [29].\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 1B shows the predicted structures of all the eight members of the IAN family proteins in mice. The AIG1 domain [22] that contains a GTP-binding motif and a functionally undefined RxxxθNN[R,K][A,E] (θ, hydrophobic amino acids) sequence, designated as the IAN motif, was found in all the members. All members except IAN2 carried the coiled-coil motif. \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 showed markedly high similarity in amino acids (83.8% identity in 291 aa) and in ORF nucleotides (88.9% identity in 873 bp) (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S3).\n\nIn addition to mouse, every vertebrate examined so far contained the IAN family gene cluster (Figure 1A and \n\t\t\t\t\t1C), whereas no IAN genes were found in the genomes of invertebrates and microorganisms that were registered in the public databases of NCBI and Ensembl, suggesting that the IAN family genes may play a role in the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. Interestingly, a cluster of the IAN family genes was found in the genome of \n\t\t\t\t\tArabidopsis thaliana (Figure 1A), and this cluster included \n\t\t\t\t\tAIG1, the expression of which was elevated upon infection by pathogenic bacteria [33]. Other higher plants also carried the IAN family genes (Figure 1C).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 Expression Is Increased upon Positive Selection of Thymocytes\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) revealed that all eight members of the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN family in mouse were expressed abundantly in the spleen and the lymph node, followed by the thymus, bone marrow, and lung, but were poorly expressed in other tissues (Figure 2A). In the spleen, all the IAN genes were predominantly expressed in CD4+, CD8+, or B220+ lymphocytes rather than in Mac1+ myeloid cells, and the expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, IAN5, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN7 was higher in T lymphocytes than in B lymphocytes (Figure 2A). In the thymus, the expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 was robustly elevated during the development of CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) thymocytes into CD4 single-positive (SP) and CD8SP thymocytes (Figure 2A), in agreement with the initial microarray results (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S1). Among the other IAN family members, the expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN3 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 was moderately but significantly increased during the development of DP cells into SP cells (Figure 2A). Thus, \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 are highly expressed in T lymphocytes, and their expression is significantly elevated upon the maturation of DP to SP thymocytes.\n\nThe expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 was higher in DP CD5high thymocytes than in DP CD5low thymocytes or TCRα-deficient DP thymocytes (Figure 2B), and higher in positive-selector DP thymocytes than in null-selector DP thymocytes in TCR-transgenic mice (Figure 2C). In normal mouse thymocyte subpopulations, the expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 was increased in accordance with the positive selection of immature DP thymocytes to mature SP thymocytes, including the increase along the early events during the development of DP CD69low cells to DP CD69high cells and the increase along the late events during the development of CD4SP CD69high cells to CD4SP CD69low cells (Figure 2D). In vitro stimulation of TCRα-deficient DP thymocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin resulted in marked increases in \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 expression and a modest increase in \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 expression (Figure 2E). Similarly, in vitro stimulation of immature DP thymocytes, which were isolated from MHC class I and class II double-deficient mice, with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies significantly increased \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 expression (Figure 2F). Thus, the expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 is increased during the positive selection of thymocytes.\n\n        Premature Overexpression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 Causes Apoptosis of DP Thymocytes\n\nTo study the roles of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 in thymocyte development, CD4/CD8 double-negative (DN) immature thymocytes obtained from day 14.5 fetal mice were infected with retroviruses that overexpressed IAN genes along with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Figure 3A–3C) and examined for developmental capability in 2-deoxyguanosine-treated fetal thymus. It was found that the overexpression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 reduced the number of EGFP+ thymocytes (Figure 3D) and the EGFP intensity of those EGFP+ thymocytes (Figure 3E). The increase in frequency of DN thymocytes and the decrease in frequency of DP thymocytes were modestly but significantly caused in the EGFP+ cells by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 overexpression (Figure 3E). The frequency of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 overexpressing EGFP+ DP thymocytes but not in EGFP+ DN thymocytes (Figure 3F). These effects of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 overexpression were detected only in EGFP+ cells and not in coexisting EGFP− cells (Figure 3D) that failed to express retrovirus-mediated genes and that comprised more than 30% of total thymocytes in the fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) (Figure 3E), indicating that the effects of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 overexpression were specific for the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1-overexpressing cells but not for co-existing EGFP− thymocytes, and that the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 overexpression affected thymocyte development in the presence of normally developing thymocytes. Thus, the premature overexpression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 kills DP thymocytes, disturbing subsequent T cell development. By contrast, the overexpression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 or \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 did not significantly influence thymocyte development (Figure 3D and \n\t\t\t\t\t3E).\n\n        Knockdown of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 Differentially Disturbs Thymocyte Development\n\nLoss-of-function examination of thymocyte development was carried out using the retrovirus-mediated RNA interference technique. In this technique, shRNA was expressed under the control of the PolIII-dependent U6 promoter (Figure 4A). The shRNA markedly and specifically decreased the expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 in immature T cells at both mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4B and \n\t\t\t\t\t4C). By contrast, the other IAN family members, \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN2, IAN3, IAN6, IAN7, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN9, were not affected by any of the shRNAs (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S4), further indicating the specificity of the shRNA-mediated knockdown.\n\nDN immature thymocytes were infected with retroviruses that expressed these shRNA along with EGFP, and were transferred into 2-deoxyguanosine-treated fetal thymus. The infection with the shRNA retroviruses did not affect cell culture conditions or the development of uninfected cells, as no significant effects were detected on the number of developing thymocytes in the EGFP+ fractions as well as in the EGFP− fractions (Figure 4D) or on the developmental profiles of EGFP− thymocytes (unpublished data). It was found that \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 shRNA had no significant effects on the CD4/CD8 profile of EGFP+ cells, whereas \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA caused a significant decrease in the generation of EGFP+ CD4SP thymocytes, which paralleled the increase in frequency of EGFP+ DP cells (Figure 4E and \n\t\t\t\t\t4F). In agreement with the thymocyte frequency, the cellularity of the EGFP+ CD4SP subpopulation was significantly reduced by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA expression (2.4 × 103 ± 0.3 × 103 by the control \n\t\t\t\t\tluciferase shRNA expression, and 1.0 × 103 ± 0.2 × 103 by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA expression; \n\t\t\t\t\tp &lt; 0.001). By contrast, the cell number of the EGFP+ DP subpopulation was not significantly affected by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA expression (9.4 × 103 ± 1.3 × 103 by the control \n\t\t\t\t\tluciferase shRNA expression, and 8.3 × 103 ± 1.3 × 103 by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA expression; not significant). Furthermore, \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA significantly reduced the generation of CD8SP CD5high and CD4SP CD5high mature T cells but not that of DP thymocytes within the EGFP+ population (Figure 5A). The introduction of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 shRNA significantly decreased the generation of AND-TCR–transgenic CD4SP T cells and 2C-TCR–transgenic CD8SP CD5high T cells (Figure 5B). Thus, \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 is required for supporting the positive selection of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells.\n\nOn the other hand, the introduction of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA most markedly decreased the frequency of DP and CD4SP cells and increased that of DN and CD8SP immature cells within the EGFP+ population (Figure 4E and \n\t\t\t\t\t4F). In agreement with the frequency, the cellularity of EGFP+ DP and EGFP+ CD4SP subpopulations was significantly reduced by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA expression (EGFP+ DP cells: 9.4 × 103 ± 1.3 × 103 by the control \n\t\t\t\t\tluciferase shRNA expression, and 6.0 × 103 ± 0.9 × 103 by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA expression (\n\t\t\t\t\tp &lt; 0.05); EGFP+ CD4SP cells: 2.4 × 103 ± 0.3 × 103 by the control \n\t\t\t\t\tluciferase shRNA expression, and 0.9 × 103 ± 0.2 × 103 by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA expression (\n\t\t\t\t\tp &lt; 0.001)). By contrast, the cell number of EGFP+ DN and EGFP+ CD8SP immature subpopulations was elevated by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA expression (8.6 × 103 ± 1.0 × 103 by the control \n\t\t\t\t\tluciferase shRNA expression, and 12.4 × 103 ± 1.4 × 103 by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA expression; \n\t\t\t\t\tp &lt; 0.05). The distribution of DN subpopulations defined by CD25 and CD44 in the EGFP+ cells was not affected by the infection of day 14.5 fetal thymocytes that were mostly DN1 and DN2 before the culture, with the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA retrovirus (Figure 5C), whereas the infection of purified DN4 thymocytes with the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA retrovirus significantly reduced the generation of EGFP+ DP cells but significantly increased the numbers of EGFP+ DN and EGFP+ CD8SP immature cells in 2-d FTOC (Figure 5D). These results indicate that \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 is required for the optimal generation of DP thymocytes.\n\n        Association of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 with Bcl-2 Family Proteins\n\nTo gain an insight into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of thymocyte development by the IAN family members, an antibody array of signal transduction molecules was screened for proteins that could bind to IAN4, revealing the selective binding of the Bcl-2 family proteins, including anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S5). Subsequent examination with co-immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis using transfected 293T cells confirmed that either \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 or \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 interacted with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Figure 6A). In addition, IAN4 or \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 also interacted with the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax, Bak, Bad, and BimEL in the transfected 293T cells. By contrast, \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1 was selectively associated with the pro-apoptotic member, Bax, and not with the other Bcl-2 family members tested (Figure 6A). Two other unrelated proteins, IκBα and EGFP, did not interact with any of the IAN family proteins (Figure 6A), highlighting the specificity of the interaction between the IAN family proteins and the Bcl-2 family proteins.\n\nWithin the BW5147 thymocyte lines that were transduced with the IAN family genes, \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 were predominantly localized in the intracellular membrane fractions, including the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S6), in agreement with the localization of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL ([34]; also shown in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S6B). On the other hand, IAN1 was found in the cytoplasmic fraction (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S6), in agreement with the localization of Bax [34].\n\nTo study the interaction of the IAN family proteins with the endogenous Bcl-2 family proteins in T-lymphoid cells, we initially tested 23–1–8 T lymphocyte clones expressing FLAG-tagged \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 or FLAG-tagged IAN5. IP of FLAG-tagged \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 or \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in the co-precipitation of endogenous Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (Figure 6B). Reciprocally, endogenous Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL IP with anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Bcl-xL antibodies was co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 or \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 (Figure 6C). The pro-apoptotic member Bax was also co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 or \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 in 23–1–8 T cells (Figure 6D). This co-precipitation of Bax was more pronounced in the cells that initiated apoptosis upon IL-2 withdrawal, than in the cells exposed to IL-2 (Figure 6D), in agreement with the apoptosis-associated translocation of Bax from the cytoplasm to the intracellular membrane fractions [34,\n\t\t\t\t\t35] where \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 are predominantly localized (\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure S6).\n\nWe then analyzed the interaction between the endogenous IAN family proteins and the endogenous Bcl-2 family proteins in 23–1–8 T lymphocytes. As shown in \n\t\t\t\t\tFigure 6E, IP of endogenous IAN4 with anti-IAN4 antibody led to the co-precipitation of a small fraction of endogenously expressed Bcl-2 in the intracellular membrane fractions such as the nuclear and heavy membrane fractions. These results indicate that the IAN family proteins are associated with the endogenous Bcl-2 family proteins in T lymphocytes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 Regulates T Cell Survival and Apoptosis\n\nBased on the findings that both IAN4 and IAN5 are involved in the generation of T lymphocytes (Figures 4 and \n\t\t\t\t\t5) and are associated with the Bcl-2 family proteins (Figure 6), we finally studied the role of these molecules in the survival and apoptosis of T lymphocytes. We found that the knockdown of \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 in the IL-2-dependent 23–1–8 T cell line reduced the viability of the cells upon IL-2 withdrawal (Figure 7A), whereas the IAN4 knockdown had no effect in this condition (unpublished data). Apoptosis as determined by Annexin V staining or the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was also enhanced by the \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 shRNA (Figure 7B and \n\t\t\t\t\t7C). These results indicate that \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5 is required for supporting the survival of T lymphocytes upon cytokine withdrawal.\n\nThe reduced survival of the IL-2–withdrawn 23–1–8 T cells by IAN5 shRNA was markedly restored by the additional expression of \n\t\t\t\t\tBcl-xL (Figure 7D). The overexpression of \n\t\t\t\t\tBcl-xL failed to inhibit the apoptosis of 23–1–8 T cells induced by helenalin (Figure 7D), an inducer of caspase-dependent apoptosis that occurs independent of Bcl-2-family–mediated mitochondrial signals [36], indicating that the Bcl-xL–mediated restoration of cell survival is specific for mitochondrial apoptosis [34]. These results indicate that the \n\t\t\t\t\tBcl-xL overexpression specifically interferes with the enhanced apoptosis by IAN5 knockdown, suggesting the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in the IAN5-mediated regulation of T cell survival.\n\n      Discussion\n      \nThe present study shows that \n\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 are highly expressed in mature T lymphocytes and their expression is significantly elevated in DP thymocytes upon TCR-mediated positive selection. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 disturbed T cell development at the process of positive selection, whereas the knockdown of \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 affected the earlier stage of T cell development at the generation of DP thymocytes. By contrast, the knockdown of \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 did not significantly affect T cell development. On the other hand, the premature overexpression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 induced the apoptosis of DP thymocytes, whereas the overexpression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 or \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 showed no significant effects on T cell development. These results indicate that \n\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 critically and differentially regulate the development of T lymphocytes in the thymus.\n\nOur results suggest that IAN4 and IAN5 are associated with the Bcl-2 family proteins including anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as pro-apoptotic Bax, whereas IAN1 is selectively associated with Bax. The overexpression of Bcl-xL restored the reduced survival of T cells caused by IAN5 deficiency, suggesting the role of Bcl-xL in the IAN5-mediated regulation of T cell survival. Our results also show that TCR signals in immature thymocytes upregulate the expression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN1, IAN4, and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5. Although it is possible that the expression and function of these IAN family members in developing thymocytes may also be regulated by the survival signals derived from other receptors, such as the IL-7 receptor and Notch-1, our results suggest that IAN1, IAN4, and IAN5 may relay TCR signals for apoptosis regulation by the Bcl-2 family members, critically controlling the survival and death of immature thymocytes and possibly regulating the repertoire selection of developing T cells in the thymus.\n\nIAN4 and IAN5 are highly similar in terms of primary structure and subcellular localization. However, the knockdown of \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 and \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 differentially affected thymocyte development; i.e., IAN4 deficiency disturbed positive-selection–mediated SP thymocyte generation, whereas IAN5 deficiency affected DP thymocyte generation (Figures 4 and \n\t\t\t\t5). As the expression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN5 but not \n\t\t\t\tIAN4 was detected in the newly generated DP thymocytes before the TCR engagement (e.g., TCRα-deficient DP thymocytes in \n\t\t\t\tFigure 2B, and DP CD69low thymocytes in \n\t\t\t\tFigure 2D), the differential effects of IAN4 deficiency and IAN5 deficiency may be due, at least in part, to their differential expression profiles in the developing thymocytes. On the other hand, it was also shown that the knockdown of \n\t\t\t\tIAN5, but not \n\t\t\t\tIAN4, enhanced the apoptosis of the IL-2–dependent T cell line upon IL-2 withdrawal, suggesting that IAN4 and IAN5 differentially regulate the survival of mature T cells that express both IAN4 and IAN5. The differential functions of IAN4 and IAN5 may also be applied to developing thymocytes. We are currently producing mice deficient in either IAN4 or IAN5 in order to elucidate the differential roles of IAN4 and IAN5 in thymocyte development and selection as well as mature T cell survival in vivo.\n\nIt was previously reported that IAN4 and IAN5 are highly expressed in leukemia cells [15,\n\t\t\t\t22]. However, our results showed that the overexpression of either IAN4 or IAN5 did not significantly influence the cellularity or development of immature thymocytes in FTOC (Figure 3). It is thus possible that in promoting cellular growth and/or oncogenesis, IAN4 and IAN5 may differentially affect immature thymocytes and other lymphoid cells including mature T lymphocytes. In vivo analysis of the long-term effects, including malignancy, of IAN4 or IAN5 overexpression in hematopoietic cells is in progress.\n\nIt was previously shown that a mutational loss of IAN5 in rat (\n\t\t\t\tlyp mutation) causes T lymphopenia [16–20], which leads to the development of insulin-dependent type I diabetes [30]. IAN5 deficiency in rat T lymphocytes causes mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous apoptosis [18]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of T cell survival by IAN5 was not clarified. Our results indicate that IAN5 knockdown enhances the apoptosis of T lymphocytes upon cytokine withdrawal, and that the reduced survival of T cells by the IAN5 knockdown is restored by the overexpression of Bcl-xL. Our results also suggest that IAN5 is associated with the Bcl-2 family proteins. Together, the present results suggest that IAN5 expressed in T lymphocytes regulates the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway through the interaction with the Bcl-2 family proteins.\n\nOur results also show that the IAN5 knockdown perturbs the generation of DP thymocytes. This perturbation appears to occur during the differentiation of CD8SP immediate precursor cells to DP thymocytes (Figure 5C and \n\t\t\t\t5D). A similar phenotype of the thymocytes was described in vivo in IAN5-deficient rat, in which the number of DP thymocytes was reduced and that of DN thymocytes was increased [19]. Interestingly, this phenotype was found in not only \n\t\t\t\tlyp/\n\t\t\t\tlyp rats but also \n\t\t\t\tlyp/+ rats [19], indicating that the haploinsufficiency of IAN5 affects thymocyte development. Indeed, our results show that the reduction of IAN5 mRNA level to approximately 50% could affect thymocyte development (Figure 4C and \n\t\t\t\t4F), supporting the notion that the amount of IAN5 expression critically regulates the generation of DP thymocytes.\n\nThe molecular basis for the association of the IAN family proteins with the Bcl-2 family proteins is still unclear. Our results show that either IAN4 or IAN5 interacts with endogenous Bax in apoptotic T cells rather than in healthy growing T cells even though the total amount of intracellular Bax expression is equivalent in apoptotic cells and growing cells (Figure 6D). It was previously shown that Bax, which is localized in the cytosol of normal cells, responds to apoptosis-inducing stimuli by translocating onto the mitochondrial membrane where apoptotic reactions including ΔΨm loss and cytochrome-c release are operated [34,\n\t\t\t\t35]. Thus, the interaction between Bax and IAN4 or IAN5 is likely regulated by the apoptotic stress-induced translocation of Bax to the mitochondria where IAN4 and IAN5 are localized. These results suggest that the association between the IAN family proteins and the Bcl-2 family proteins, including the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, likely reflects a specific association with physiological relevance rather than merely a detection of nonspecific binding between overexpressed molecules. Accordingly, we detected the association between endogenous IAN4 and endogenous Bcl-2 in T cells. The specific association at the mitochondria between anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and either IAN4 or IAN5 is further supported by our preliminary results that the deletion of the C-terminal hydrophobic region from either one of Bcl-xL, IAN4, or IAN5 caused the failure in their mitochondrial localization and in the association between Bcl-xL and either IAN4 or IAN5 (unpublished data). We are currently studying the structural basis for the intracellular association between the IAN family proteins and the Bcl-2 family proteins in detail to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IAN-family–mediated apoptosis regulation.\n\nFinally, our results showed that the premature overexpression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 kills DP thymocytes. Our results also showed that unlike IAN4 and IAN5, IAN1 is selectively associated with pro-apoptotic Bax rather than anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Thus, IAN1 may be involved in regulating the apoptosis of immature DP thymocytes, possibly during the negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes. However, in agreement with previous reports [9,\n\t\t\t\t10], our results showed that the expression of \n\t\t\t\tIAN1 is increased during the positive selection of thymocytes. It is possible that differential TCR signals that determine the positive and negative selection of immature thymocytes may critically regulate the timing and amount of IAN1 expression; high-avidity and/or strong TCR engagement may result in a rapid and/or marked elevation of IAN1, which may cause the apoptosis of immature thymocytes, whereas low-avidity and/or weak TCR engagement may slowly and/or modest increase IAN1 expression, which may not be sufficient to kill positively selected thymocytes. We are currently studying the role of IAN1 in positive and negative selection in greater detail by using TCR-transgenic thymocytes.\n\nIn conclusion, the present results indicate that the IAN family genes encode a novel family of TCR-responsive proteins that critically regulate the survival and death of developing T lymphocytes. As the first described gene cluster conserved in vertebrates and higher plants, the IAN family may also provide clues to yet unknown self-defense mechanisms common in higher organisms.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Oligonucleotide microarray\n        \nTotal RNA extracted from thymocytes of \n\t\t\t\t\tH-2b\n\t\t\t\t\t AND-TCR–transgenic mice and C57BL/6 mice was reverse-transcribed, in vitro transcribed in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics, New York, New York, United States), and hybridized to an oligonucleotide array (Murine Genome U74Av2, U74Bv2, and U74Cv2, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States). Fluorescence intensities were captured with a laser confocal scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California, United States), and analyzed with Microarray Suite Version 4.0 software (Affymetrix). Two independent experiments were performed to ascertain the reproducibility. Array data has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE3909).\n\n        Bioinformatic analysis\n        \nGenome sequences were obtained from Celera database (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.celera.com, NCBI public database (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ncbi.nih.gov, Ensembl database (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ensembl.org/index.html), and InterPro database (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro). AIG1 domain and coiled-coil motifs were identified using CD-Search (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, SMART (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://smart.embl-heidelberg.de, and COILS (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html). The neighbor-joining tree was drawn using GENETYX software (GENETYX, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n        Retrovirus infection and FTOC\n        \nThe retrovirus vector pMRX-IRES-EGFP [37] was used for the overexpression of cDNA in BW5147 cells or 23–1–8 cells. For the overexpression in fetal thymocytes, pMSCV-IRES-EGFP [38] was used. To construct retrovirus vectors expressing shRNA, oligonucleotides encoding stem-loop shRNA sequences (\n\t\t\t\t\tTable S2) were inserted into the \n\t\t\t\t\tBamHI-\n\t\t\t\t\tEcoRI site of pSIREN-RetroQ, which was purchased from BD Clontech, Mountain View, California, United States. For the expression of shRNA in fetal thymocytes, a DNA fragment encoding IRES-EGFP was obtained from pMRX-IRES-EGFP and inserted into the \n\t\t\t\t\tXhoI site of pSIREN-RetroQ to monitor the shRNA-expressing cells. Further construction details are available upon request.\n\nPlat-E cells were transfected for retrovirus production [39]. BW5147, NIH-3T3, or 23–1–8 cells were infected with retroviruses in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene. Retrovirus infection of day 14.5 B6 fetal thymocytes was previously described [40]. DN4 thymocytes were purified from day 16.5 fetal thymocytes by depleting CD4, CD8, CD44, and CD25 using biotinylated antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) (&gt;97% purity). Retrovirus-infected fetal thymocytes were transferred into 2-deoxyguanosine–treated day 15.5 B6 fetal thymus lobes by hanging drop culture, and the reconstituted thymus lobes were cultured in conventional FTOC conditions [40].\n\n        Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting\n        \nMulticolor flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting were performed using FACS-Calibur or FACS-Vantage (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, United States) as described [40,\n\t\t\t\t\t41]. Cells with &gt;95% purity were used. For the detection of apoptosis in developing thymocytes, cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated Annexin V (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) before staining for CD4 and CD8. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by staining cells with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocynine iodide and propidium iodide (PI).\n\n        Quantitative RT-PCR\n        \nReal-time RT-PCR was performed with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix and iCycler iQ Real Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States). Amplified signals were confirmed to be single bands over gel electrophoresis, and normalized to GAPDH levels. Primer sequences are available upon request.\n\n        Antibody production\n        \nRabbits were immunized with synthetic peptides of mouse IAN4 (METLQNVVTGGKKGGC) and IAN5 (LQKSTYGTIVQGPEAHC) conjugated to KLH (MBL).\n\n        Antibody array and IP analysis\n        \nAntibody array analysis was performed using Signal Transduction Array (Hypromatrix, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For IP of FLAG-tagged proteins, cell lysates in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors were incubated with agarose-bead-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States). For IP with anti-Bcl-2 (BD Biosciences) or anti-Bcl-xL (MBL) antibodies, cell lysates were incubated with primary antibodies and agarose-bead-conjugated protein A or G. The beads were then washed and boiled in Laemmli gel-loading buffer before performing SDS-PAGE and IB. For IP with anti–Bcl-2 antibody, the cell lysis buffer contained 1% Triton X-100 instead of 1% CHAPS. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described [15].\n\n      Supporting Information\n\n        Accession Numbers\n        \nThe Genbank (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank) accession numbers for the genes and gene products discussed in this paper are: mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap4 (NM_174990.3), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN2/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap1 (NM_008376.3), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN3/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap7 (NM_146167.3), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN4/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap3 (AB164418.1), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN5/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap5 (AB126961.1), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN6/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap6 (NM_153175.3), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN7/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap9 (BC096680.1), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN9/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap8 (AB178029), rat \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap4 (NM_173153), human \n\t\t\t\t\tIAN1/\n\t\t\t\t\tgimap4 (NM_018326), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tGAPDH (M32599.1), mouse \n\t\t\t\t\tbcl-2 (L31532.1), human \n\t\t\t\t\tbcl-xL (Z23115.1), human \n\t\t\t\t\tbax (NM_138761.2), human \n\t\t\t\t\tbak (NM_001188.2), human \n\t\t\t\t\tbad (NM_004322.2), human \n\t\t\t\t\tbimEL (AF032457.1), and human \n\t\t\t\t\tIκBα(AY033600.1).",
