  "fullText": "Fig 2 has been replaced with replicate data given uncertainties concerning the data of one of the western blots presented. The figure legend remains the same.\n\nFig 3 was incorrect as some images in panel B were mistakenly added from other blots. The authors have provided a corrected version here whereby all blots in panel B have been replaced. The figure legend remains the same.\n\nFig 6 has been replaced due to irregularities in the consistency of background signal for some images in panels Aâ€“F. The authors have provided a corrected version. The figure legend remains the same."
