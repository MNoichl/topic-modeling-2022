  "fullText": "There is an error in the second sentence of the Author Summary. The correct sentence is: Imprinting has served as a model system to understand the mechanisms through which chromatin modifications can influence transcriptional regulation; comparisons between active and repressed alleles in the same cell nucleus provide an internal control for the effects of DNA sequence and exposure to diffusible regulators."
