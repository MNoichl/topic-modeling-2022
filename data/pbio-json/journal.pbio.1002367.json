  "fullText": "The authors would like to correct Fig 6, its legend, and the legend for S9 Fig. In addition, a new supporting information file will be published.\n\nIn Fig 6A, the two Î±-tubulin loading control panels are duplicated for presentation purposes, as the results come from the same western blot samples. The authors have provided a corrected legend for Fig 6 here.\n\nIn Fig 6B, the CSC2 p-STAT3 panel was inadvertently duplicated in the X01 panel in the published figure. The Ex Vivo Nestin panel was also inadvertently duplicated in the 1123NS panel. This figure has been remade with the correct data (new X01 and 1123NS panels). The revised version of Fig 6 is provided here.\n\nIn S9A Fig, the same GAPDH loading control panel is reused in Fig 1A, due to the same RNA samples being used for both figures. The authors have provided a corrected legend for S9 Fig here.\n\nDue to the low resolution and quality of the published bands in Fig 1C,D,F,G,K, Fig 2C,H,K, and Fig 8D, as well as S5B Fig and S9B Fig, the authors would like to provide a new file (S1 Original Data), which contains the original blots. PLOS Biology would like to clarify that the journal checks for such quality issues pre-publication, but unfortunately on this occasion, these issues were not noticed before the paper was published. As the quality issues do not affect the scientific understanding of the paper, the journal encouraged the authors to include the higher quality data as part of this correction.\n\nSupporting Information"
