  "fullText": "Fig 3 is incorrect. The authors have provided a corrected version here. The left panel of Fig 3A has been replaced with a replicate. This panel was accidentally swapped and the data for IB: WRAP53 was reused in Fig 6C. The legend remains the same.\n\nFig 5 is incorrect. The authors have provided a corrected version here. A splice-line has been included to clearly indicate the lanes in Fig 5D. The legend remains the same.\n\nFig 7 is incorrect. The authors have provided a corrected version here. The lower left image (IB: coilin) of Fig 7C has been flipped as it was originally presented upside down. A new legend is provided.\n\nAn additional supplementary file, named S7 Fig, shows the uncropped data for Fig 7C.\n\nSupporting information"
