  "fullText": "The authors would like to clarify two issues recently raised by the PLOS Biology editors.\n\nThe image included in the original publication for S1E Fig, right panel, LRP1 blot, is incorrect. This image was erroneously constructed during the submission process to PLOS Biology. Additionally, several images of gels were unintentionally altered during processing that resulted in discontinuous bands (including Panel A Actin, Panel B LRP1 and Actin, Panel C Actin, Panel D LRP1 and Actin, and Panel E GAPDH of right panel). The authors have provided a correct figure that resolves these issues.\n\nSupporting information"
