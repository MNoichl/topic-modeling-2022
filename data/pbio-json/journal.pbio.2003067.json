  "abstract": "Human Long interspersed element-1 (L1) retrotransposons contain an internal RNA polymerase II promoter within their 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and encode two proteins, (ORF1p and ORF2p) required for their mobilization (i.e., retrotransposition). The evolutionary success of L1 relies on the continuous retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs. Previous studies identified functional splice donor (SD), splice acceptor (SA), and polyadenylation sequences in L1 mRNA and provided evidence that a small number of spliced L1 mRNAs retrotransposed in the human genome. Here, we demonstrate that the retrotransposition of intra-5′UTR or 5′UTR/ORF1 spliced L1 mRNAs leads to the generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). We identified a new intra-5′UTR SpIRE that is ten times more abundant than previously identified SpIREs. Functional analyses demonstrated that both intra-5′UTR and 5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs lack Cis-acting transcription factor binding sites and exhibit reduced promoter activity. The 5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs also produce nonfunctional ORF1p variants. Finally, we demonstrate that sequence changes within the L1 5′UTR over evolutionary time, which permitted L1 to evade the repressive effects of a host protein, can lead to the generation of new L1 splicing events, which, upon retrotransposition, generates a new SpIRE subfamily. We conclude that splicing inhibits L1 retrotransposition, SpIREs generally represent evolutionary “dead-ends” in the L1 retrotransposition process, mutations within the L1 5′UTR alter L1 splicing dynamics, and that retrotransposition of the resultant spliced transcripts can generate interindividual genomic variation.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nLong interspersed element-1 (L1) is a non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon that comprises approximately 17% of human genomic DNA [1]. Over 99.9% of human L1s cannot retrotranspose due to 5′ truncations, internal DNA rearrangements, or point mutations that inactivate the L1-encoded proteins [1–4]. However, the average diploid genome harbors approximately 80–100 full-length retrotransposition-competent L1s (RC-L1s) [5], including a small number of expressed [6–8], highly active (i.e., “hot”) L1s [5,9–11] that can retrotranspose efficiently in cultured cells or cancers. RC-L1 retrotransposition affects both intra- and interindividual human genetic variation (reviewed in [12,13]) and, on occasion, can lead to disease-producing mutations [14–16].\n\nHuman RC-L1s are approximately six kilobases (kb) in length [17,18]. They contain a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that harbors both sense [19] and antisense [20] RNA polymerase II promoters (Fig 1A) as well as an antisense open reading frame (ORF0) [21], which encodes a protein that may mildly enhance L1 retrotransposition efficiency. The 5′UTR is followed by two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) that are separated by a 63–base pair (bp) inter-ORF spacer that contains two in-frame stop codons [18,22] (Fig 1A). L1s end with a 3′UTR, which contains a conserved polypurine motif, a “weak” RNA polymerase II polyadenylation signal, and a variable length polyadenosine (poly(A)) tract (Fig 1A) [17,23–25].\n\nORF1 encodes an approximately 40-kilodalton (kDa) protein (ORF1p) [26] that contains an amino-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain required for ORF1p trimerization [27–29], a centrally located noncanonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain [29,30], and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) harboring conserved basic amino acid residues [29–32] (Fig 1A). The RRM and CTD are critical for ORF1p nucleic acid binding [32–36]; the nucleic acid chaperone activity is postulated to play a role in L1 integration [30,36,37]. ORF2 encodes an approximately 150-kDa protein (ORF2p) [38–40] that contains conserved apurinic/apyrimidinic-like endonuclease (EN) [41,42] and reverse transcriptase (RT) domains [31,43,44] as well as a conserved cysteine-rich (C) domain [31,45] (Fig 1A). Biochemical activities contained within both ORF1p and ORF2p are required for canonical EN-dependent L1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells [31,41].\n\nA round of human RC-L1 retrotransposition begins with the internal sense-strand promoter initiating transcription at or near the first nucleotide of the 5′UTR [13,19,46,47]. The resultant bicistronic L1 mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes translation [22,46,48,49]. Following translation, ORF1p and ORF2p preferentially bind to their encoding mRNA in cis to form a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) [33,35,50–53]. The 3′ poly(A) tail of L1 mRNA is a critical Cis-acting determinant for recruitment of nascent ORF2p to L1 RNA [51,54]. Components of the L1 RNP gain access to the nucleus by a mechanism that does not require nuclear envelope breakdown [55, 127]. L1 integration likely occurs by target-site primed reverse transcription (TPRT) [41,53,56,57]. During TPRT, the L1 EN makes a single-strand endonucleolytic nick at a thymidine-rich sequence (e.g., 5′-TTTT/A-3′, 5′-TTTC/A-3′, etc.) present on the “bottom” strand of a target site in genomic DNA to liberate a 3′ hydroxyl (3′-OH) group [41,57,58]. Microhomology-based annealing between the L1 poly(A) tail and thymidine residues at the L1 EN cleavage site in genomic DNA enhances the ability of the L1 ORF2p RT to use the resultant 3′-OH group as a primer to initiate reverse transcription of L1 mRNA [53,59]. How TPRT is completed requires elucidation. However, as demonstrated for the related R2 non-LTR retrotransposon from Bombyx mori [60], it is possible that enzymatic activities associated with L1 ORF2p participate in both second-strand (i.e., “top” strand) genomic DNA cleavage and second-strand L1 cDNA synthesis.\n\nAlthough retrotransposition assays and biochemical studies revealed the L1-encoded proteins preferentially retrotranspose their encoding mRNA in cis [50,53,61,62], L1 ORF1p and/or ORF2p can act in trans (Trans-complementation) to retrotranspose RNAs encoded by nonautonomous short interspersed elements (SINEs; e.g., Alu RNA [63,64] and SINE-R/VNTR/Alu [SVA] RNA [65–67]). Additionally, the L1-encoded protein(s) can act in trans to retrotranspose noncoding RNAs [12,68–73] and cellular mRNAs, with the latter process leading to the formation of processed pseudogenes [50,62,73–77].\n\nThe evolutionary success of L1 requires the faithful retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs. Previous studies have revealed the presence of functional splice donor (SD), splice acceptor (SA), and premature polyadenylation signals in primary full-length RC-L1 transcripts [24,78–81]. Paradoxically, the use of these sites during posttranscriptional RNA processing leads to the production of truncated and/or internally deleted L1 mRNAs [24,78–81], which could adversely affect L1 retrotransposition. Thus, it is somewhat surprising that Cis-acting sequences that could negatively affect L1 retrotransposition have not been removed by negative selection during L1 evolution.\n\nHere, we address how the retrotransposition of spliced L1 mRNAs leads to the generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). We describe two classes of SpIREs: those that splice within the 5′UTR (intra-5′UTR SpIREs) and those that splice from within the 5′UTR into the ORF1 sequence (5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs). Additionally, we suggest a mechanism for why some apparently deleterious Cis-acting splice sites within L1 mRNA are conserved throughout L1 evolution. Finally, we provide experimental evidence revealing that L1 splicing dynamics are altered by structural changes within the 5′UTR that allow L1s to evade host repression and that retrotransposition of the resultant spliced variants can lead to the generation of new classes of SpIREs. Thus, these data provide a snapshot of how an “arms race” between L1 and host repressive factors may affect the evolutionary trajectory of L1 5′UTRs. In sum, we conclude that SpIREs are deficient for retrotransposition and likely represent evolutionary “dead-ends” in the L1 retrotransposition process.\n\nResults\n\nA polymorphic L1 likely resulted from the retrotransposition of a spliced L1 mRNA\n\nUsing fosmid-based discovery methods, we previously identified a polymorphic L1 (fosmid accession #AC225317) in the human population that contains a 524-nucleotide deletion within its 5′UTR [10]. Upon closer inspection, we determined that this deletion likely resulted from the retrotransposition of a spliced L1 RNA that used a previously identified SD (G98U99) [78] and an unreported SA (A620G621) within the L1 5′UTR (numbering based on L1.3, accession #L19088; [9,82]) (Fig 1A and 1B). The structure of this element resembled previous L1s characterized by Belancio and colleagues, supporting the hypothesis that spliced L1 transcripts can complete retrotransposition in the human genome [78,79]. We named these L1s SpIREs to distinguish them from bona fide full-length genomic L1s. The three SpIREs investigated here all use the same SD (G98U99) but use different SA sequences that reside within either the L1 5′UTR (SA: A620G621 or SA: A788G789) or L1 ORF1 (SA: A974G975) (Fig 1B, 1C and 1D).\n\nSpIREs are present in the human genome\n\nWe used the BLAST-like alignment tool (BLAT) (https://genome.ucsc.edu) [83] (in which transposable element—derived DNAs are not masked) to search the human genome reference (HGR, GRCh38/hg38) for SpIRE G98U99/A620G621 sequences (referred to as SpIRE97/622). The HGR contains an annotated record of L1s that have accumulated over evolutionary time (i.e., millions of years); thus, searching the genome should reveal how SpIREs contribute to the genomic L1 repertoire. We used a 100-nucleotide in silico probe that spans the intra-5′UTR splice junction present in SpIRE97/622 (nucleotides 47–97 and 622–672 of L1.3) to query the HGR. We identified 116 SpIRE97/622 sequences, which span the youngest L1PA1 subfamily (also known as L1Hs, members of which are currently amplifying in the human population) through the older L1PA6 subfamily (which amplified approximately 27 million years ago [MYA]), but none in older (L1PA7–L1PA17, L1PB, and L1MA) L1 subfamilies (S1A Fig) [84,85]. Thus, 116 out of 6,609 (about 1.8%) of previously annotated full-length L1s in the L1PA1–L1PA6 subfamilies are actually SpIRE97/622 sequences (S1 Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table).\n\nAlmost half of the SpIRE97/622 sequences we identified belong to the L1PA3 subfamily (53 sequences, comprising about 3.4% of previously annotated full-length L1s in that subfamily) (S1A Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table). The L1PA1 subfamily harbors six SpIRE97/622 (comprising about 2.0% of previously annotated full-length L1s in that subfamily) and the L1PA6 subfamily contains only one SpIRE97/622 (comprising 0.1% of previously annotated full-length L1s in that subfamily) (S1 Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table). Seven SpIRE97/622 sequences could not be unambiguously assigned to a specific L1 subfamily and are classified as either L1PA2–L1PA3 or L1PA4–L1PA6 sequences (S1 Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table) [86].\n\nGiven the above data, we used BLAT to search the HGR for additional L1s containing G98U99/A788G789 and G98U99/A974G975 splicing events identified by Belancio and colleagues (referred to as SpIRE97/790 and SpIRE97/976, respectively) [78,79]. These searches confirmed the presence of four previously identified SpIRE97/790 sequences in the L1PA1–L1PA2 subfamilies (S1A Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table) [78]. We also discovered an additional SpIRE97/976 sequence in addition to the ten previously identified SpIRE97/976 sequences (S1A Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table) [78,79]. In total, these three classes of SpIREs comprise a small but notable (131/6,609 or about 2%) percentage of previously annotated full-length L1s from the L1PA1–L1PA6 subfamilies. The SpIRE97/622 sequences discovered here represent the majority (116/131 or about 89%) of identified SpIREs.\n\nSpIREs contain L1 structural hallmarks\n\nWe next characterized the 131 SpIRE97/622, SpIRE97/790, and SpIRE97/976 sequences. We first examined the post-integration (i.e., filled) site of each SpIRE in the HGR sequence. We then used the genomic sequences flanking each SpIRE to reconstruct a putative pre-integration (i.e., empty) site. Many of the SpIRE sequences, especially those from older L1 subfamilies, have degenerate poly(A) tails at their 3′ ends, which, in some cases, made it difficult to reconstruct the putative pre-integration site to bp resolution (S1 Data; S1 Table). These analyses revealed that SpIREs generally are flanked by target site duplications that ranged in size from about 6–25 bp, end in a 3′ poly(A) tract, and integrated into an L1 EN consensus cleavage site (5′-TTTT/A-3′ and variants of that sequence) (S1 Data; S1 Table). Consistent with previous studies, approximately 39% (51/131) of the SpIREs are present within the introns of RefSeq (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) [87] annotated genes [69,88,89], and the majority (32/51 or about 63%) of these SpIREs are present in the opposite transcriptional orientation of the annotated gene (S1 Table) [90,91]. Other structural features of the SpIREs are shown in S1 Data and S1 Table. In sum, our analyses strongly suggest that SpIREs represent a subset of genomic L1 insertions and retrotranspose by the canonical process of L1 EN-dependent TPRT.\n\nIntra-5′UTR splicing reduces L1 promoter activity\n\nThe formation of SpIRE97/622 results in the deletion of five known transcription factor binding sites within the L1 5′UTR [47,92–97] (Fig 1A); thus, we hypothesized the SpIRE97/622 5′UTR would have reduced promoter activity. To test this hypothesis, we subcloned the wild-type (WT) L1.3 [9,82] or SpIRE97/622 5′UTR sequences upstream of a promoter-less firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene (vector pGL4.11), creating pPLWTLUC and pPL97/622LUC, respectively (Fig 2A). We then characterized the promoter activity of these 5′UTRs using functional assays.\n\nWe first conducted northern blot analyses using polyadenylated mRNAs isolated from untransfected HeLa-JVM cells and HeLa-JVM cells transfected with the luciferase expression vectors (Fig 2). An RNA probe complementary to ribonucleotides 7–99 of the L1 5′UTR (Fig 2A; purple line) detected a strong signal at the expected size of about 2.7 kb in mRNAs derived from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPLWTLUC, but not in mRNAs derived from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/622LUC or pGL4.11 or from untransfected HeLa-JVM cells (Fig 2B, first panel). Similar results were obtained using riboprobes complementary to either ribonucleotides 103–336 of the L1 5′UTR (Fig 2A, red line; Fig 2B, second panel) or the 3′ end of luciferase (Fig 2A, blue line; Fig 2B, third panel). These data are consistent with previously published findings [47], which demonstrated that L1 transcription begins at or near the first nucleotide of the L1 5′UTR. Control experiments verified the integrity and quality of the mRNAs (Fig 2B, actin probe).\n\nWe were able to detect a faint band representing the predicted approximately 2.2 kb mRNA from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/622LUC upon the prolonged exposure of the northern blots using probes complementary to ribonucleotides 7–99 of the L1 5′UTR, but not using a probe complementary to ribonucleotides 103–336 of the L1 5′UTR (S2A Fig; purple arrow). The absence of the predicted approximately 2.2-kb band in HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/622LUC using a probe complementary to the 3′ end of the luciferase gene is likely due to the limits of detection in our assay (S2A Fig). The origin of the approximately 2-kb transcript remains unclear (Fig 2B, S2A Fig, orange arrow); however, it could be representative of transcript initiation downstream of the canonical transcriptional start site within the 5′UTR [47,98]. These data suggest that the SpIRE97/622 5′UTR retains weak promoter activity. Because the splicing events that gave rise to SpIRE97/790 and SpIRE97/976 led to larger deletions of the 5′UTR when compared to SpIRE97/622, we reasoned that they would lead to a similar, if not a greater, reduction in transcriptional activity; thus, they were not tested in this assay.\n\nTo corroborate the northern blot analyses, we conducted dual luciferase expression assays on whole cell lysates (WCLs) derived from HeLa-JVM cells co-transfected with firefly luciferase-based vectors (pPLWTLUC, pPL97/622LUC, or pGL4.11) and a constitutively expressed Renilla (Renilla reniformis) luciferase internal control plasmid (pRL-TK; Methods). Consistent with the northern blot data, HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPLWTLUC exhibited an approximately 267-fold increase of normalized firefly luciferase activity when compared to cells transfected with the promoter-less pGL4.11 vector (Fig 2C; S2 Table). By comparison, HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/622LUC exhibited only about a 7-fold increase of normalized firefly luciferase activity when compared to cells transfected with the promoter-less pGL4.11 vector (Fig 2C; S2 Table). Together, the above data suggest that the splicing event leading to the generation of SpIRE97/622 severely compromises its promoter activity.\n\nMutating the 5′ SD site results in decreased L1 promoter activity\n\nGiven that splicing reduces L1 promoter activity, we examined why the G98U99 SD may be conserved in the L1 5′UTR. Previous studies revealed that a RUNX3 binding site within the 5′UTR is important for maximal L1 promoter activity [96]. Interestingly, the SD site used to generate the three classes of SpIREs reported here is contained within the core sequence of a RUNX3 binding site that is conserved from the L1PA1–L1PA10 subfamilies (Fig 1A; SD: G98U99; S1B Fig) [84]. Thus, we hypothesized that this SD is retained to maintain an active RUNX3 transcription factor binding site. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the SD sequence within the WT 5′UTR (U99C, creating pPLSDmLUC) [99] and tested if this mutation affects 5′UTR promoter activity. Northern blot analyses using the previously described riboprobes detected a signal at about 2.7 kb in mRNAs derived from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPLSDmLUC. However, there is markedly less of this mRNA when compared to cells transfected with pPLWTLUC (Fig 2B; about 18% of pPLWTLUC). In contrast, mutating the SA site within the WT 5′UTR (A620C, creating pPLSAmLUC) did not drastically affect L1 promoter activity (Fig 2B). Thus, our data are consistent with previous findings [96] and suggest that the retention of the complete RUNX3 site containing the G98U99 SD is critical for L1 promoter activity.\n\nReverse transcription PCR based detection of intra-5’UTR splicing events\n\nWe next sought to identify spliced L1 mRNAs that might have given rise to SpIREs. To this end, we conducted end-point reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) experiments using poly(A) mRNAs isolated from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with a series of L1/firefly luciferase expression vectors (S2B Fig; Methods). The REV-LUC oligonucleotide (S2B Fig, purple line) was used to initiate L1/firefly luciferase first-strand cDNA synthesis; the cDNA products then were PCR amplified using FWD-5′UTR (S2B Fig, red line) and REV-LUC (S2B Fig, purple line) oligonucleotide primers. The resultant cDNAs were separated on an agarose gel, cloned, and characterized using Sanger DNA sequencing. Control experiments conducted in the absence of RT revealed that the characterized PCR products were derived from the amplification of cDNAs (S2C Fig).\n\nWe detected the predicted full-length L1/firefly luciferase cDNA products from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPLWTLUC, pPLSDmLUC, and pPLSAmLUC (Fig 2D, yellow “*” in lanes 1, 3, and 4) as well as the shorter predicted L1/firefly luciferase cDNA product from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/622LUC (Fig 2D, yellow “#” in lane 2). In agreement with our northern blot experiments (Fig 2B), we did not detect cDNAs consistent with SpIRE97/622 splicing in pPLWTLUC transfected HeLa-JVM cells (Fig 2D). However, we did detect an L1/firefly luciferase cDNA that corresponds to the SpIRE97/790 splicing event from cells transfected with pPLWTLUC and pPLSAmLUC (Fig 2D, yellow “+”, lanes 1 and 4; Fig 1C) [78]. Importantly, this product was not detected in HeLa-JVM cells transfected with either pGL4.11 or pPLSDmLUC or untransfected HeLa-JVM cells.\n\nIntra-5′UTR splicing does not dramatically affect L1 mRNA translation\n\nWe next tested whether intra-5′UTR splicing affects L1 mRNA translation. L1 sequences were cloned into an episomal pCEP4 expression vector that contains a hygromycin B resistance gene and a cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter, which augments L1 expression. HeLa-JVM cells were transfected with a WT L1 (pJM101/L1.3), an L1 that contains a 5′UTR deletion (pJM102/L1.3), or an L1 containing the SpIRE97/622 deletion (pPL97/622/L1.3) (Fig 3A) [9,50].\n\nWestern blot analyses were conducted using WCLs that were derived from hygromycin-resistant HeLa-JVM cells transfected with the above constructs 9 days post-transfection. An ORF1p polyclonal antibody (α-N-ORF1p; directed against amino acids +31 to +49 in L1.3 [100] [UniProtKB accession #Q9UN81]) detected an approximately 40-kDa product in cells transfected with pJM101/L1.3, pJM102/L1.3, and pPL97/622/L1.3 but not in cells transfected with the pCEP/GFP control (Fig 3B). HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/622/L1.3 exhibited a slight reduction in the steady-state level of ORF1p when compared to HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pJM101/L1.3 or pJM102/L1.3 (Fig 3B). Because a CMV promoter augmented L1 transcription, it is unlikely that this reduction is due to reduced L1 expression. It is possible that the slight reduction in ORF1p is due to an alteration of the L1 5′UTR RNA secondary structure and/or minor changes in the stability of pPL97/622/L1.3 mRNA when compared to pJM101/L1.3 and pJM102/L1.3 mRNAs.\n\n5′UTR/ORF1 splicing leads to amino-terminal truncated ORF1p\n\nThe splicing event yielding SpIRE97/976 results in an amino-terminal ORF1 deletion of 66 nucleotides, including the canonical ORF1p methionine start codon (Fig 3C, black AUG, 40 kDa). We hypothesized that ORF1p synthesis might initiate from two methionine codons (AUG) that are located in weak Kozak consensus sequences either 102 or 270 ribonucleotides downstream from the canonical AUG start codon (Fig 3C) [101]. If the downstream methionine codons are used for translation initiation, we expect to detect amino terminal truncated ORF1 proteins of about 33 kDa and 27 kDa, respectively.\n\nWestern blot analyses were conducted as above using WCLs derived from hygromycin-resistant HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pJM101/L1.3, an L1 containing the SpIRE97/976 deletion (pPL97/976/L1.3), or pCEP/GFP control vectors (Fig 3A) [22]. As predicted, the α-N-ORF1p and α-C-ORF1p antibodies detected an approximately 40-kDa protein in WCLs derived from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pJM101/L1.3 but did not detect a protein in WCLs derived from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with the pCEP/GFP control (Fig 3D, left and right panels). The α-N-ORF1p antibody detected an approximately 33-kDa protein in WCLs derived from HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pPL97/976/L1.3 (Fig 3D, left panel), whereas the α-C-ORF1p antibody detected approximately 33-kDa and approximately 27-kDa proteins in the same extracts and an unknown cross-reacting protein at about 25 kDa (Fig 3D, right panel). Similar results were obtained when RNP extracts were used in western blot experiments, although western blots performed with the α-C-ORF1p antibody did not detect the cross-reacting approximately 25-kDa protein (S3A Fig). To confirm that the approximately 33-kDa and 27-kDa products were ORF1p derived, we introduced a T7-gene10 epitope tag to the 3′ end of ORF1, creating pPL97/976/L1.3-T7. Western blots using a α-T7 antibody recapitulated our previous results and, similar to RNP preparations, did not identify the cross-reacting approximately 25-kDa protein (S3B Fig). Thus, the 5′UTR/ORF1 splicing event leads to the generation of an mRNA that, if translated, results in the synthesis of amino-terminal truncated derivatives of ORF1p.\n\nIntra-5′UTR splicing decreases subsequent rounds of L1 retrotransposition\n\nOur data indicate that SpIRE97/622 contains a defective promoter and, if transcribed, SpIRE97/622 mRNA is translated at slightly lower levels than WT L1 mRNA. Thus, we hypothesized that an intra-5′UTR spliced L1 mRNA would be capable of undergoing an initial round of L1 retrotransposition. However, the resultant full-length retrotransposition events would contain a defective promoter, which may compromise subsequent retrotransposition.\n\nTo test the above hypothesis, we examined whether RNAs derived from a cohort of L1 expression constructs could retrotranspose using a cultured cell retrotransposition assay [31]. The 3′UTR of each construct contains a retrotransposition indicator cassette (mneoI). The mneoI cassette consists of an antisense copy of a neomycin phosphotransferase gene whose coding sequence is interrupted by an intron that resides in the same transcriptional orientation as the L1 [31,102]. This arrangement ensures that the expression of a functional neomycin phosphotransferase gene will only be activated upon L1 retrotransposition, thereby conferring cellular resistance to the drug G418 [31,102]. Retrotransposition efficiency then can be quantified by counting the resultant numbers of G418-resistant foci [31,61].\n\nConsistent with previous reports (e.g., [31,41]), mRNAs derived from RC-L1s that contain both CMV and 5′UTR (Fig 4A, pJM101/L1.3, black bar; S3 Table), CMV only (Fig 4A, pJM102/L1.3, black bar; S3 Table), or 5′UTR only (Fig 4A, pJM101/L1.3ΔCMV, gray bar; S3 Table) promoters could efficiently retrotranspose. By comparison, the pPL97/622/L1.3 expression construct produced mRNAs that could undergo efficient retrotransposition when a CMV promoter augmented L1 expression (Fig 4A, black bar, about 70% the activity of pJM101/L1.3; S3 Table), but not when L1 expression was driven from the 5′UTR harboring the intra-5′UTR splicing event (Fig 4A, pPL97/622/L1.3ΔCMV gray bar, about 7% the activity of pJM101/L1.3; S3 Table). Consistent with this observation, control experiments revealed that an L1 lacking promoter sequences (Fig 4A, pJM102/L1.3ΔCMV; S3 Table) [50] was unable to retrotranspose. Additional controls demonstrated that an L1 containing a missense mutation (pJM105/L1.3; D702A) that disrupts ORF2p RT activity [50] severely reduced L1 retrotransposition efficiency (Fig 4A; S3 Table). Thus, the data suggest that the SpIRE97/622 intra-5′UTR splicing event severely compromises L1 5′UTR promoter activity as well as subsequent rounds of L1 retrotransposition.\n\n5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs rely on ORF1p supplied in trans for mobilization\n\nThe retrotransposition of an mRNA derived from a 5′UTR/ORF1 splicing event would generate a SpIRE (e.g., SpIRE97/976) that contains a defective promoter and, if transcribed and translated, would produce amino-terminal truncated versions of ORF1p. If the truncated version(s) of ORF1p were nonfunctional, we reasoned that the 5′UTR/ORF1 splicing event would lead to an L1 mRNA that is compromised for an initial round of retrotransposition in cis. Indeed, RNAs derived from pPL97/976/L1.3 could not retrotranspose despite expression being driven by CMV (Fig 4B; S4 Table).\n\nWe next hypothesized that a source of WT ORF1p would be required to act in trans to promote the retrotransposition of L1 mRNAs containing a 5′UTR/ORF1 splicing event. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected pPL97/976/L1.3 (whose expression is augmented by a CMV promoter) with a series of “driver” L1 expression plasmids that lack the mneoI retrotransposition indicator cassette [22,50]. The co-transfection of pPL97/976/L1.3 with “driver” plasmids that express WT ORF1p, pJBM561 (a monocistronic ORF1p expression vector), pJM101/L1.3NN, or pJM105/L1.3NN, resulted in low levels of pPL97/976/L1.3 RNA retrotransposition in trans (Fig 4C; columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively; S5 Table). By comparison, the co-transfection of pPL97/976/L1.3 with “driver” plasmids that do not express ORF1p (pORF2/L1.3NN [a monocistronic ORF2p expression vector] or pCEP4) did not support retrotransposition in trans (Fig 4C; columns 4 and 5, respectively; S5 Table) [22]. Thus, the expression of ORF1p, but not ORF2p, can promote low levels of retrotransposition of mRNAs derived from pPL97/976/L1.3 in trans.\n\nStructural changes within the 5′UTR alter L1 splicing dynamics\n\nRT-PCR experiments using L1/firefly luciferase expression vectors uncovered evidence of SpIRE97/790 splicing events (Fig 2D). Intriguingly, SpIRE97/790 sequences are only present in the L1PA1 and L1PA2 subfamilies (S1A Fig; S1 Data; S1 Table) [84]. Indeed, the analysis of 1,000 genomes data [103] revealed that the L1PA1 SpIRE97/790-3 sequence (S1 Data; S1 Table) is polymorphic with respect to presence in the human population (about 41% homozygous “filled”; 35% heterozygous; 24% homozygous “empty”), whereas L1PA2 SpIRE97/790 sequences appear to be fixed with respect to presence in humans. Additionally, we identified four non-reference L1PA1 SpIRE97/790 sequences in data from the 1000 Genomes Project (S1 Data; S1 Table). Thus, SpIRE97/790 sequences may represent an evolutionarily younger SpIRE subfamily than the SpIRE97/622 and SpIRE97/976 sequences, which are predominantly found in older L1 subfamilies (S1 Data; S1 Table).\n\nRecently, an elegant study from the Haussler laboratory demonstrated that the Krüppel-associated Box-containing Zinc-Finger Protein 93 (ZNF93) could bind within L1PA3 and L1PA4 5′UTRs to repress their expression [104]. Intriguingly, a 129-bp deletion that eliminates the ZNF93 binding site within the L1PA2 and L1PA1 5′UTRs allowed them to evade ZNF93-mediated repression [104]. This 129-bp sequence resides between a putative branch site and the SA sequence used to generate the spliced L1 RNA that gave rise to SpIRE97/790 sequences (Fig 5A). Thus, we hypothesized this 129-bp deletion may have altered L1 5′UTR splicing dynamics by relocating the SpIRE97/790 SA (A916G917 in L1PA3) to a favorable splicing context in L1PA2 and L1PA1 subfamily members (Fig 5A).\n\nTo test the above hypothesis, we generated L1/firefly luciferase expression vectors containing the 5′UTR of a “hot” L1 (L1RP [accession #AF148856]) [106] or a version of the L1RP 5′UTR that includes the 129-bp L1PA4 sequence containing the ZNF93 binding site [104] upstream of a promoter-less firefly luciferase gene (pGL4.11), creating pJBMWTLUC and pJBMWT129PA4LUC, respectively (Fig 5B, top panel). We also created a control vector that has a “scrambled” version of the 129-bp L1PA4 sequence (pJBMWT129SCRLUC) [104] (Fig 5B, top panel). Dual luciferase assays using WCLs derived from HeLa-JVM cells co-transfected with pJBMWTLUC, pJBMWT129PA4LUC, pJBMWT129SCRLUC, or pGL4.11 and a constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid (pRL-TK; Methods) revealed that pJBMWTLUC and pJBMWT129PA4LUC exhibited an increase (about 345- or about 320-fold, respectively) of normalized firefly luciferase activity, when compared to the promoter-less pGL4.11 vector (Fig 5B, bottom panel; S6 Table). By comparison, pJBMWT129SCRLUC exhibited a significant, though less pronounced, increase (about 88-fold) of normalized firefly luciferase activity (Fig 5B, bottom panel; S6 Table). Thus, in general agreement with previous studies [104], the 129-bp L1PA4 insert does not negatively affect L1RP5′UTR transcriptional activity. As an additional control, we confirmed that the 129-bp L1PA4 sequence did not significantly affect L1 activity using an EGFP-based retrotransposition assay (Fig 5C; S7 Table) [104].\n\nTo test whether the presence or absence of the 129-bp L1PA4 sequence affects intra-L1 5′UTR splicing, we used a slightly modified version of the end-point RT-PCR strategy depicted in Fig 2D. In agreement with experiments performed with pPLWTLUC (Fig 2D), we detected the predicted full-length L1RP 5′UTR cDNAs as well as SpIRE97/790 spliced cDNAs in cells transfected with pJBMWTLUC (Fig 5D, yellow “*” and yellow “+,” respectively, lane 3). By comparison, HeLa-JVM cells transfected with pJBMWT129PA4LUC yielded the predicted full-length 5′UTR L1 cDNA (Fig 5C, yellow “**” lane 4), but did not yield cDNAs corresponding to the SpIRE97/790 splicing event. Instead, we detected a new spliced cDNA that used the same G98U99 SD and a new SA that resides within the 129-bp L1PA4 sequence (A851G852), which is not present in the WT L1RP sequence (Fig 5A and 5D, lane 4, yellow “@”). Finally, we detected the predicted full-length L1RP 5′UTR cDNAs from cells transfected with pJBMWT129SCRLUC, as well as a biologically irrelevant product that utilized the same G98U99 SD and an SA that resides within the 129-bp L1PA4 scrambled sequence (Fig 5D, lane 5, yellow “***” and yellow “$,” respectively). Thus, our data demonstrate that the loss of the 129-bp sequence from L1PA3 resulted in a new splicing pattern that led to the emergence of SpIRE97/790 sequences (Fig 5A and 5D).\n\nFinally, we examined whether the new cDNA detected from cells transfected with pJBMWT129PA4LUC corresponds to a SpIRE. Indeed, a BLAT search of the human genome using an in silico probe that spans the intra-5′UTR splice junction present in this putative SpIRE (nucleotides 47–97 and 853–903 of pJBMWT129PA4LUC) yielded nine additional SpIRE97/853 sequences (S1 Data; S1 Table). These additional SpIREs retain L1 structural hallmarks (S1 Data; S1 Table), indicating that canonical EN-dependent TPRT led to their generation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe evolutionary success of L1 requires the continued retrotransposition of full-length L1 RNAs. Thus, it was surprising when Belancio and colleagues identified a small number of L1 retrotransposition events in the HGR that apparently were derived from spliced L1 RNAs [78,79]. Here, we confirmed and extended those findings and report a novel group of retrotransposed L1s that are derived from an L1 RNA containing an intra-5′UTR splicing event (SpIRE97/622; Fig 1). SpIRE97/622 is 10 times more prevalent than previously identified SpIREs and comprises about 1.8% of the annotated full-length L1 retrotransposition events accumulated during the past approximately 27 million years (MY) (S1 Fig).\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that L1 ORF1p and L1 ORF2p exhibit Cis-preference and preferentially bind to their encoding mRNA to promote its retrotransposition (Fig 6A) [33,35,38,50–53]. Using a cell culture based retrotransposition assay in HeLa cells, we demonstrated that L1 mRNAs that contain intra-5′UTR splicing events can produce ORF1p and ORF2p and undergo an initial round of retrotransposition in cis (Fig 6B). However, the resultant SpIREs lack Cis-acting sequences required for efficient L1 transcription (Fig 2) [47,94,96] and, as a result, are compromised for subsequent rounds of retrotransposition (Figs 4A and 6B).\n\nIn contrast to intra-5′UTR splicing events, L1 mRNAs containing 5′UTR/ORF1 splicing events produce nonfunctional, amino-terminal truncated versions of ORF1p (Fig 3C; S3A and S3B Fig). As a result, these mRNAs are retrotransposition defective in cis and must rely on exogenous sources of ORF1p to promote their retrotransposition by Trans-complementation (Figs 4B and 4C and 6C). Notably, these experiments also provide genetic evidence that ORF2p can be translated from the 5′UTR/ORF1 spliced L1 mRNAs. In the rare cases in which Trans-complementation occurs, the resultant 5′UTR/ORF1 SpIRE will lack Cis-acting sequences required for efficient L1 transcription and, if transcribed, would produce nonfunctional versions of ORF1p. The loss of Cis-acting sequences and the requirement for Trans-complementation make it highly unlikely that the resultant 5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs could undergo subsequent rounds of retrotransposition (Fig 6C).\n\nThe above data strongly indicate that SpIREs represent evolutionary “dead ends” in the L1 amplification process. It is possible that a small number of SpIREs could give rise to new L1 retrotransposition events. For example, the insertion of a SpIRE97/622 downstream of a cellular promoter could, in principle, enhance its expression and subsequent retrotransposition. However, any resultant retrotransposition event would contain a defective promoter and ultimately be compromised for subsequent rounds of retrotransposition. Thus, we conclude that splicing negatively affects L1 retrotransposition.\n\nThe SpIREs examined in this study each use a common SD site (G98U99) but different SA sites (A620G621, A788G789, A851G852, or A974G975) [78,79]. These findings raise the following question: if splicing adversely affects L1 retrotransposition, why are these splice sites retained in L1 RNA? The G98U99 SD site is about 46 MY old, is conserved in the L1PA1–L1PA10 subfamilies (S1B Fig) [84], and resides within a core binding site for the RUNX3 transcription factor [96]. Indeed, previous studies indicated that mutating U99 in the L1 5′UTR impairs RUNX3 binding and decreases 5′UTR transcriptional activity [96]. Consistent with these findings, we found that mutating the SD sequence leads to an approximately 5-fold reduction in L1 steady-state RNA levels (Fig 2B). Together, these data strongly suggest that the benefit conferred by the RUNX3 transcription factor binding site at the DNA level outweighs the cost of harboring the SD site (G98U99) in L1 RNA.\n\nDespite the evolutionary conservation of the G98U99 SD, northern blotting experiments revealed that the vast majority of L1 5′UTRs are not subject to splicing (Fig 2B). SpIREs are therefore most likely formed when L1 RNAs containing rare splicing events undergo retrotransposition. The reason(s) G98U99 is not efficiently utilized as a functional SD site requires elucidation. However, it is possible that the G98U99 sequence is sequestered into a secondary structure within L1 RNA that restricts its access to U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (reviewed in [107,108]). Alternatively, a cellular protein(s) might bind at or near the SD site, thereby blocking its ability to interact with U1 snRNA. Either scenario provides a plausible mechanism for how L1 maintains a functional SD sequence in its mRNA and could, in part, explain why SpIREs only represent about 2% of annotated full-length L1 retrotransposition events that occurred during the past approximately 27 MY.\n\nSA sites within the 5′UTR might also reside in functional transcription factor binding sites or functionally conserved regions of ORF1p. For example, the A788G789 SA is about 70 MY old and is conserved through the L1PA15B subfamily (S1B Fig), suggesting that it may reside in a conserved Cis-acting motif. The ORF1 A974G975 SA resides at codon positions two and three of lysine 22, and any nucleotide change at codon position two would result in an amino acid substitution in ORF1p that may adversely affect its function. Thus, it is possible that some functional splice sites are embedded in sequences that are critical for 5′UTR and/or ORF1p function.\n\nOur data reveal how host-factor—driven L1 5′UTR evolution can alter L1 splicing dynamics. We demonstrated that structural changes in the 5′UTR can lead to collateral intra-5′UTR splicing changes, which have resulted in the generation of new SpIRE97/790 sequences (Fig 5A and 5D). In addition to yielding insights into the evolution of human L1 5′UTR sequences, these experiments demonstrate the utility of our luciferase-based reporter constructs to prospectively detect ancestral L1 splicing events that led to the generation of an older SpIRE (SpIRE97/853) subfamily (Fig 5A and 5D; S1 Data; S1 Table). Although the SpIRE97/622 sequence is the most abundant SpIRE in the HGR, only SpIRE97/790 sequences were detected in our RT-PCR experiments. These data, as well as the finding that five of eight SpIRE97/790 sequences are polymorphic with respect to presence/absence in the human population, suggest that SpIRE97/790 sequences are currently amplifying in modern human genomes.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the splicing events detected from engineered L1 mRNAs in transfected HeLa cells recapitulate many splicing events that led to SpIRE formation in the human genome (Figs 2D and 5D, and [78,79]). It has recently been shown that a small number of distinct genomic L1 loci are expressed in a cell type—specific manner [6–8]. Moreover, L1 splicing and/or premature polyadenylation patterns vary among human tissues and cell types [79,80,109,110], host proteins involved in splicing and polyadenylation associate with L1 RNPs [100,111–113], and overexpression of the Epstein-Barr Virus SM protein alters L1 splicing and premature polyadenylation patterns [79]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that L1 posttranscriptional processing may suppress expression and/or retrotransposition of full-length L1s in a developmental or cell type—specific manner.\n\nIn sum, our data strongly indicate that L1 mRNA splicing is detrimental to L1 retrotransposition and further strengthen the hypothesis that ORF1p and ORF2p predominantly retrotranspose their encoding full-length L1 RNAs to new genomic locations in cis. In addition, we demonstrated that despite harboring evolutionarily conserved functional SD and SA sites within their 5′UTR, the vast majority of L1 transcripts apparently evade splicing. Finally, we provide experimental evidence revealing that changes within the L1 5′UTR, which are driven by the escape from host-factor repression, lead to collateral changes in L1 splicing profiles. Together, these data provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics of the L1 5′UTR and raise the intriguing possibility that host factors that promote L1 splicing or alter L1 splicing profiles may represent a mechanism by which the cell can disrupt full-length L1 RNA to prevent unabated L1 retrotransposition.\n\nMethods\n\nE. coli and the propagation of plasmids\n\nAll plasmids were propagated in DH5α Escherichia coli (genotype: F- φ80lacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169 recA1 endA1 hsdR17 (rk-, mk+) phoA supE44 λ- thi-1 gyrA96 relA1) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Competent cells were generated as described previously [114]. Plasmids were prepared using the Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.\n\nCell lines and cell culture conditions\n\nHeLa-JVM cells (obtained from Dr. Maxine Singer and originally cited in reference [31]) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) lacking pyruvate (Invitrogen). DMEM was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum (FBS) and 1X penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine to create DMEM-complete medium, as described previously [31]. HeLa-JVM cells were grown in a humidified tissue culture incubator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 37°C in the presence of 7% CO2.\n\nBLAT searches and SpIRE sequence curation\n\nBLAT [83] was used to screen build 38 (GRCh38/hg38) of the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu) using 100 bp in silico probes that spanned (50 bases upstream and downstream) the splice junctions of SpIRE97/622, SpIRE97/790, and SpIRE97/976. The in silico probes were designed using the L1.3 sequence (accession #L19088 [9,82]) as a template. A 100-bp in silico probe that spanned (50 bases upstream and downstream) the splice junction of SpIRE97/853 was designed using the pJBMWT129PA4LUC sequence. Putative SpIREs shared &gt;95% sequence identity with the in silico probes.\n\nPutative SpIREs were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser and manually curated with the aid of repeat masker (http://repeatmasker.org). Each sequence was inspected to ensure it contained a splicing event and represented a bona fide SpIRE. For four events that were prematurely 3′ truncated, we analyzed 4 kb of genomic DNA flanking the 3′ end of the SpIRE to determine if it shared &gt;95% sequence identity with L1.3 using the Serial Cloner alignment tool (http://serialbasics.free.fr/Serial_Cloner.html). We were unable to identify any L1 sequence in the flanking DNA; thus, we cannot determine the reason for the apparent 3′ truncation in these four SpIREs. Structural hallmarks of L1 integration events that occur by canonical TPRT (e.g., the presence of target site duplications, the presence of untemplated nucleotides at the 5′ genomic DNA/L1 junction [47,69,89,115], a 3′ poly(A) tract, and putative L1-mediated sequence transductions) [23,116,117] were determined manually by analyzing sequences flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of each SpIRE [69,116,118]. The L1 “empty site” for all SpIREs is inferred; the 3′ TSD was considered the ancestral “empty site” and any nucleotide differences between the 5′ and 3′ TSD are annotated in the 5′ TSD only. Sequences are named based on the splicing event contained within the SpIRE (SpIRE97/622, SpIRE97/790, SpIRE97/976, or SpIRE97/853) and a corresponding number for easy referral between S1 Data and S1 Table (for example; SpIRE97/622-1 is the first of the analyzed 116 SpIRE97/622 sequences).\n\nDetermining the conservation of SD and SA sites\n\nKhan et al. 2006 provided full-length L1 subfamily consensus sequences of L1PA1 (L1Hs) through L1PA16 and assembled an alignment of the respective 5′UTRs [84]. We manually inspected these alignments to determine the oldest L1 subfamily that contained the 5′UTR SD/SA sequences utilized in generating the reported SpIREs. We next determined the conservation of the ORF1 SA sequence (A974G975) by aligning full-length L1 consensus sequences provided in Khan et al. 2006 using the ClustalW alignment function [84,119] from the MegAlign (http://www.dnastar.com/t-megalign.aspx) software. As with the 5′UTR, we manually inspected the resulting alignment to determine the oldest L1 subfamily that contained the ORF1 SA sequence (A974G975).\n\nIdentification of putative branch point sequences\n\nTo identify putative splicing branch point sequences, we utilized the L1.3 5′UTR (accession #L19088) sequence and the pJBMWT129PA4LUC 5′UTR sequence and submitted them for analysis using the Human Splicing Finder v3.0 online prediction program (http://www.umd.be/HSF3/HSF.html) [105]. The resultant analyses identify potential SD, SA, and branch point sequences and assign consensus value scores for each motif [105]. Motif scores greater than 80 represent “strong” splice sites; sequences with scores less than 80 represent “weaker” splice sites. The 5′UTR sequence of each L1 was uploaded and analyzed by the general “Analyze a Sequence” function. We then selected predicted branch points that might pair with the known SA: A788G789 (L1.3) and A851G852 (pJBMWT129PA4LUC) based on their proximity to the SA sequence [120]. We identified a putative branch point (A763C764C765T766C767A768C769) with a score of 95.75 that could pair with the SA: A788G789 in the L1.3 5′UTR. We also identified a putative branch point (T795C796C797A798G799A800G801) with a score of 75.73 that could pair with the SA: A851G852 in the pJBMWT129PA4LUC 5′UTR (Fig 5A).\n\nGenotyping and discovery of non-reference SpIREs\n\nWe performed in silico genotyping of four SpIRE97/790 loci using reads from the 1000 Genomes Project [103,121]. Read pairs anchored within 600 bp of each locus were extracted from each of 2,453 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. Extracted read pairs were aligned to reconstructed reference (insertion) and alternative (empty site) sequences and the most likely genotype for each sample was determined based on the number and mapping quality of read pairs aligned to each allele [121]. Read pairs that aligned entirely within the L1 sequence as well as read pairs that show equivalent alignments to both the reference and alternative sequences were ignored in the analysis.\n\nWe utilized an anchored read pair mapping approach to identify additional non-reference SpIRE97/790 insertions in the 1000 Genomes Project samples. We searched alignment files from 2,453 samples for read pairs in which one read is aligned across the splice junction in one of the four SpIRE97/790 sequences represented in the genome reference sequence and the other read is uniquely aligned elsewhere in the genome. We then intersected the resulting anchored locations with a recently published map of non-reference L1 insertions discovered in the same samples [122], identifying four insertions supported by multiple SpIRE-associated read pairs. To further characterize these loci, we extracted insertion-supporting read pairs for each locus and performed a de novo read assembly using the CAP3 assembler [123]. This analysis results in a collection of short contigs for each locus, which extend into the flanking edges of each inserted L1 element.

Briefly, 8×106 HeLa-JVM cells were seeded into a T-175 Falcon tissue culture flask (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). On the following day, transfections were conducted using the FuGene HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). The transfection reactions contained 1 mL of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), 120 μl of the FuGene HD transfection reagent, and 20 μg of plasmid DNA per flask. The tissue culture medium was changed 24 hours post-transfection. The cells were collected 48 hours post-transfection. Briefly, cells were washed in ice-cold 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies). The cells then were scraped from the tissue culture flasks, transferred to a 15-mL conical tube (BD Biosciences), and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cell pellets were frozen at −20°C overnight. The frozen pellets were thawed and total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). Poly(A) RNAs then were isolated from the total RNAs using a Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen), suspended in UltraPure DNase/RNase-Free distilled water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the RT-PCR experiments in Fig 5D, total RNA was collected using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and polyadenylated RNA was isolated from total RNA using Dynabeads Oligo (dT)25 (Ambion).\n\nNorthern blots\n\nNorthern blot experiments were performed as previously described [100]. Briefly, Northern blot experiments were conducted using the NorthernMax-Gly Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, aliquots of poly(A) RNAs (2 μg) were incubated for 30 minutes at 50°C in Glyoxal Load Dye (containing DMSO and ethidium bromide) and then were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. The RNAs were transferred by capillary action to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA) for 4 hours and cross-linked to the membrane using the Optimum Crosslink setting of a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were then baked at 80°C for 15 minutes. Membranes were prehybridized for approximately 4 hours at 68°C in NorthernMax Prehybridization/Hybridization Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then were incubated overnight at 68°C with a strand-specific RNA probe (final concentration of probe, 3×106 cpm/ml). The following day, the membranes were washed once with low stringency wash solution (2x saline sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) and then twice with high stringency wash solution (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS). The washed membranes were placed in a film cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Autoradiography Cassette FBCA 57) and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) overnight at −80°C. Films were developed using a JP-33 X-Ray Processor (JPI America Inc., New York, NY).\n\nPreparation of northern blot probes\n\nNorthern blot probes were prepared as previously described [100]. Strand-specific αP32-UTP radiolabeled riboprobes were generated using the MAXIscript T3 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, oligonucleotide primers were used to PCR amplify portions of the L1.3 5′UTR [100] (L1.3 nucleotides 7–99 or L1.3 nucleotides 103–336) or the 3′ end of the luciferase gene (see below). The resultant PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and were purified using QIAquick gel extraction (Qiagen). The labeling reaction was carried out at 37°C using the following reaction conditions: 500 ng of gel purified DNA template, 2 μL of transcription buffer supplied by the manufacturer, 1 μL each of unlabeled 10 mM ATP, CTP, and GTP, 5 μL of αP32-UTP (10 mCi/mL), and 2 μL of T3 RNA polymerase. The reaction components then were mixed and brought to a total volume of 20 μL using nuclease-free water in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube, which was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes in a heating block. Unincorporated nucleotides were subsequently depleted using the Ambion NucAway Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To generate a control β-actin riboprobe, the pTRI-β-actin-125-Human Antisense Control Template (Applied Biosystems) was used in T3 labeling reactions. Biological triplicates of each northern blot exhibited similar results.\n\nOligonucleotide sequences were used to generate northern blot probes. A T3 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was included on the antisense (AS) primer used to generate the antisense riboprobe (underlined below):\n\nL1.3 5′UTR 7–99 Sense: 5′-GGAGCCAAGATGGCCGAATAGGAACAGCT-3′\n\nL1.3 5′UTR 7–99 AS: 5′-AATTAACCCTCAAAGGGACCTCAGATGGAAATGCAG-3′\n\nL1.3 5′UTR 103–336 Sense: 5′-GGGTTCATCTCACTAGGGAGTG-3′\n\nL1.3 5′UTR 103–336 AS: 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGTATAGTCTCGTGGTGCGCCG-3′\n\nLuciferase 3′ FFLuc Sense: 5′-GGCAAGATCGCCGTGAATTCTCAC-3′\n\nLuciferase 3′ FFLuc AS: 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGCCTGGCGCTGGCGCAAGCAGC-3′\n\nQuantification of northern blots\n\nNorthern blot bands were quantified using the ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) [125]. The intensity of the bands in the pPLWTLUC and pPLSDmLUC lanes were determined and normalized to the actin loading control. Three independent northern blots were subject to quantification. We then computed that average intensity of the bands and calculated a standard deviation. As reported in the text (Fig 2B), the steady-state level of pPLSDmLUC mRNA is about 18% the level of pPLWTLUC mRNA with a standard deviation of ±3.1%.\n\nDual luciferase assays\n\nLuciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, 2×104 HeLa cells were plated into each well of a 6-well plate (BD Biosciences). Approximately 24 hours later, each well was transfected using a transfection mixture of 100 μl Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), 3 μl of FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Promega), and 1 μg plasmid DNA (0.5 μg of a firefly luciferase test plasmid and 0.5 μg of an internal control Renilla luciferase expression). Each transfection was performed as a technical duplicate (i.e., in two wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate). Approximately 24 hours post-transfection, the transfected cells were washed once with ice-cold 1X PBS and the cells in each well were subjected to lysis for 15 minutes at room temperature using 500 μl of the 1X Passive Lysis Buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Following homogenization of the lysate by manual pipetting, 60 μl of the lysate from each well of the 6-well tissue culture plate was distributed equally in 3 wells of a 96-well white opaque, optically transparent top plate (BD Biosciences), allowing six luminescence readings for each transfection condition (six technical replicates—3 readings per well of a 6-well plate). The 96-well plate then was subject to luciferase detection assays using a GloMax-Multi Detection System (Promega) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence readings from the six technical replicates were averaged to give a single normalized luminescence reading (NLR). This assay then was performed in biological triplicate, yielding three independent NLRs. The resultant data were subsequently analyzed using a Student one-tailed t test. Error bars indicate the standard deviation. Luminescence readings from lysis buffer alone and from lysates derived from untransfected cells were included used as negative controls.\n\nRT-PCR\n\nPoly(A) selected mRNA from transfected HeLa-JVM cells in a T-175 tissue culture flask was collected as previously described for northern blots. The resultant mRNAs were subjected to targeted RT-PCR using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System, with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The REVLUC primer was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA. The FWD5′UTR and REVLUC primers then were used to amplify the resultant cDNAs (see sequences below). For RT-PCR experiments in Fig 5D, cDNA was synthesized from polyadenylated RNA with a SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using the REVLUC primer. The resultant cDNA was then subjected to PCR using the FWD5′UTR and REVLUC primers and Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) (30 cycles; annealing temp: 54°C; 1-minute extension). The RT-PCR products were separated on a 2.0% agarose gel, excised from the gel using QIAquick gel extraction (Qiagen), and cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sanger DNA sequencing performed at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core verified the cDNA sequences in the resultant plasmids. Biological triplicates of this experiment yielded similar results.\n\nThe following oligonucleotide sequences were used in the RT-PCR experiments:\n\nFWD5′UTR: 5′-GGAACAGCTCCGGTCTACAGCTCCC-3′\n\nREVLUC′ 5′-CCCTTCTTAATGTTTTTGGCATCTTCC-3′\n\nProtein collection\n\nThe plating and transfection of HeLa-JVM cells in T-175 tissue culture flasks was performed as detailed above in the mRNA isolation section except that HeLa-JVM cells were subjected to selection in DMEM-complete medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 48 hours post-transfection and the selection medium was changed every other day for 7 days. The hygromycin resistant HeLa-JVM cells were harvested 9 days post-transfection as described in the mRNA isolation section. The cell pellets were frozen at −80°C overnight. The following day, pellets were lysed for 15 minutes on ice by incubation in 0.5 mL of lysis buffer: 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40 (IGPAL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 1X Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The resultant protein lysates then were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 minutes to clear the lysate. The resultant supernatant (approximately 0.4 mL) was designated as the WCL. Alternatively, the supernatant fraction was subject to RNP collection, as previously described [35]. Briefly, 200 μL of the WCL was layered onto a sucrose solution cushion (6 mL of 17% sucrose, bottom layer, followed by 4 mL of 8.5% sucrose, top layer, overlaid by 200 μL of the WCL) and ultracentrifuged at 178,000 × g for 2 hours at 4°C. Following ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated and the resultant RNP pellet was suspended in 100 μL of water supplemented with 1X Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Bradford assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) were used to determine protein concentrations. WCLs generally yielded 15–19 μg/μL of protein. RNP preparations yielded 6–10 μg/μL of protein. The protein samples were stored at −80°C.\n\nWestern blots\n\nWestern blot experiments were performed as previously described, with minor modifications [100]. Briefly, protein samples were collected as described above and then were incubated with a 2X solution of NuPAGE reducing buffer (containing 1.75%–3.25% lithium dodecyl sulfate and 50 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) (ThermoFisher Scientific). An aliquot (20 μg) of the reduced proteins were incubated at 100°C for 10 minutes and then were separated by electrophoresis on 10% precast mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) run at 200 V for 1 hour in 1X Tris/Glycine/SDS (25 mM Tris-HCL, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Transfer was performed using the Trans-Blot Turbo Mini PVDF Transfer Packs (BioRad Laboratories) with the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad Laboratories) at 25 V for 7 minutes. The resultant membranes then were cut at the 75-kDa marker using the Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope marker (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as a guide. The membranes then were incubated at room temperature in blocking solution (containing 1X PBS and 5% dry low-fat milk) (Kroger, Cincinnati, OH). The eIF3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. [SC-28858]) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution to probe membranes for eIF3 at 110 kDa as a loading control. The α-N-ORF1p [100] antibody (directed against ORF1p amino acids 31–49; EQSWMENDFDELREEGFRR), α-C-ORF1p (directed against ORF1p amino acids 319–338; EALNMERNNRYQPLQNHAKM), and anti-T7 (Merck Millipore 69048 T7•Tag Antibody HRP Conjugate) antibodies were used at 1:10,000, 1:2,000, and 1:5,000 dilutions, respectively, to probe membranes for ORF1p. Antibody hybridizations were carried out overnight at 4°C in blocking solution. The blots were washed three times with 1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich) and then were incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of secondary Amersham ECL HRP Conjugated Donkey anti-rabbit IgG Antibodies (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 60 minutes at room temperature blocking solution. The membranes were washed three times with 1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich). The signals then were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The membranes were exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healtchare) for a time that spanned 5 seconds to 5 minutes and were developed using a JP-33 X-Ray Processor (JPI America Inc.).\n\nRetrotransposition assays\n\nThe mneoI-based L1 retrotransposition assay\n\nThe cultured cell retrotransposition assay was conducted as previously described [31,61,126]. Briefly, 2×103 HeLa-JVM cells/well were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences). Approximately 24 hours post-plating, transfections were performed using a mixture containing 100 μl Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), 3 μL FuGENE6 (Promega) transfection reagent, and 1 μg L1 plasmid DNA per well of a 6-well plate. Approximately 24 hours post-transfection, the media was replaced with DMEM-complete medium to stop the transfection. Three days post-transfection, the tissue culture medium was replaced and the cells were grown in DMEM-complete medium supplemented with 400 μg/mL of G418 (Life Technologies) to select for retrotransposition events. After approximately 12 days of G418 selection, the resultant G418-resistant foci were washed with ice cold 1X PBS, fixed to the tissue culture plate by treating them for 10 minutes at room temperature in a 1X PBS solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.4% glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich), and stained with a 0.1% crystal violet solution for 30 minutes at room temperature to visualize the G418-resistant foci. As a transfection control, parallel 6-well tissue culture dishes of HeLa-JVM cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of an L1 expression plasmid and 0.5 μg of a pCEP/GFP expression plasmid (Stratagene). Three days post-transfection, the transfected HeLa-JVM cells were subjected to fluorescence detection on an Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) to determine the transfection efficiencies (i.e., the percentage of GFP-positive cells) for each experiment [126].\n\nThe Trans-complementation retrotransposition assay\n\nThe Trans-complementation retrotransposition assay was performed as previously described with minor modifications [50]. Briefly, 2×105 HeLa-JVM cells were plated into 60-mm dishes (BD Biosciences). Approximately 24 hours post-plating, transfections were performed using a mixture containing 93 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies), 6 μl of FuGeneHD (Promega), and 2 μg plasmid DNA (i.e., 1 μg of the L1 “reporter” plasmid and 1 μg of the L1 “driver” plasmid). Subsequent steps of the retrotransposition assay were carried out as described above. As a transfection control, parallel 60-mm tissue culture dishes of HeLa-JVM cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of an L1 “reporter” plasmid, 0.5 μg of an L1 “driver” plasmid, and 1 μg of a pCEP/GFP expression plasmid (Stratagene). Three days post-transfection, the transfected HeLa-JVM cells were subjected to fluorescence detection on an Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) to determine the transfection efficiencies (i.e., the percentage of GFP-positive cells) for each experiment [126]. The transfection efficiencies were used to normalize the retrotransposition efficiencies in individual transfections. At least three biological replicates were performed for each retrotransposition assay. Error bars on all retrotransposition assays represent standard deviation of technical triplicates from the indicated experiment.\n\nThe mEGFPI-based retrotransposition assay\n\nEGFP retrotransposition assays were carried out as previously described [124]. Briefly, HeLa JVM cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2×105 cells per well. The next day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of retrotransposition reporter plasmid using 4 μL of Fugene 6 transfection reagent. Approximately 48 hours after transfection, culture media was supplemented with puromycin (5 μg/mL) to select for transfected cells. After 4 days of puromycin selection (about 6 days post-transfection), the cells were harvested using trypsin and resuspended in PBS. The percentage of GFP positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Three wells were transfected for each plasmid (three technical replicates) and 10,000 events were analyzed from each well of transfected cells. Live gating was set using forward scatter versus side scatter profile. Events that fell within the live gate were analyzed for fluorescence. Cells transfected with the retrotransposition-dead mutant pL1RP(JM111)-EGFP were used as a negative control to set GFP gating.\n\nSupporting information"
