  "fullText": "Since publication of this paper, the authors became aware of several incorrect or missing details that required correcting. The authors have provided corrected versions, along with explanations, here.\n\nFigure 1A-D have been used again in Figures S2B, S2F and S2H. This was deliberate, and on request of a referee for more detail, but we did not explicitly mention it in the figure legend. The corrected figure legend for Figure S2 has been provided here.\n\nFigure 2E: an RT-PCR experiment is shown in which overexpression of an artificial microRNA against RBR (amigo-RBR) reduces RBR RNA levels. We used two different promoters for overexpression, pG1090 XVE and 35S, and both yielded exactly the same result. We inadvertently used results for pG1090 XVE and named them 35S::amiGO-RBR in the original figure, and have now replaced these with the results for 35S::amiGO-RBR. In addition, because samples were run in separate slots on the same gel, we put a white horizontal line between the RBR and ACTIN bands. The corrected Figure 2 file has been provided here.\n\nFigure 3M uses an image that was shown again in Figure S1J for different features. We now indicate this explicitly in corrected Figure 3 and Figure S1 legends, which are shown here.\n\nFigure 3J and Figure 3T inadvertently contained images that we had previously published elsewhere, focusing on different aspects of the phenotype that emerged from the analysis of the same set of data. In the corrected Figure 3, provided here, we have replaced these panels with other representative images from the same data set which are not used elsewhere. The replicate data and choice of appropriate alternate panels for this correction was overseen by our institution.\n\nNone of these changes affect in any way the results and conclusions reported in the paper.\n\nSupporting Information"
