  "fullText": "The authors would like to clarify several issues recently raised by the PLOS Biology editors.\n\nIn Fig 1, it was not clearly indicated that the images of larvae in D and E had been constructed by tiling several micrographs together. The authors have provided a corrected figure and legend, which now clearly indicate the tiling borders with dotted lines.\n\nIn Fig 5D and 5E, there are a grey tonal “floors” at the bottom of the 3D reconstructions which is an “effect” of the Velocity software used to generate these images. The figure legend has been revised in order to clearly explain this.\n\nThe published version of S1A Fig has duplicated lanes for tnfα and cxcl1. The authors have provided a corrected version of the figure here, and note that the figure legend remains unchanged. The editors have verified the data underlying the corrected panels and are satisfied that these continue to uphold the conclusions from this figure.\n\nSupporting Information"
