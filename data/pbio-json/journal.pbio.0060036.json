PLoS Biol 5(9): e219. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050219\n\nFigure S2 was erroneously labeled. The caption should read:\n\nFigure S2. Genomic Structure of the Agouti Gene Including the Known Cis-Regulatory and Coding Regions (Based on Comparisons of Mammalian BAC Sequences: Mouse, Dog, Human)\n\nIn addition, there was an omission in the acknowledgments. The following sentence should be included:\n\nT. Glenn, N. Schable, and C. Hagen produced microsatellite libraries and provided PmBW clone sequences that were funded by National Institutes of Health grant R01Gm069601 (to M. Dewey and T. Glenn)."
