  "abstract": "Devil facial tumour 1 (DFT1) is a transmissible cancer clone endangering the Tasmanian devil. The expansion of DFT1 across Tasmania has been documented, but little is known of its evolutionary history. We analysed genomes of 648 DFT1 tumours collected throughout the disease range between 2003 and 2018. DFT1 diverged early into five clades, three spreading widely and two failing to persist. One clade has replaced others at several sites, and rates of DFT1 coinfection are high. DFT1 gradually accumulates copy number variants (CNVs), and its telomere lengths are short but constant. Recurrent CNVs reveal genes under positive selection, sites of genome instability, and repeated loss of a small derived chromosome. Cultured DFT1 cell lines have increased CNV frequency and undergo highly reproducible convergent evolution. Overall, DFT1 is a remarkably stable lineage whose genome illustrates how cancer cells adapt to diverse environments and persist in a parasitic niche.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nDevil facial tumour 1 (DFT1) is a transmissible cancer affecting Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii), marsupial carnivores endemic to the Australian island of Tasmania. Spread between devils by the transfer of living cancer cells through biting, DFT1 usually manifests as tumours on the head or inside the mouth [1,2]. Animals with symptoms consistent with DFT1 were first observed in north-east Tasmania in 1996, and the disease has subsequently expanded across the island [3,4]. DFT1 is usually fatal and has caused significant declines in devil populations, posing a serious conservation threat to the species [3–5].\n\nUnlike most cancers, which arise from and remain confined within the bodies of their hosts, DFT1 is a clonal lineage derived from the somatic cells of an individual “founder devil.” Rather than dying together with this animal, DFT1 continued to survive by spreading as an allogeneic graft through the devil population [1]. Tracing the genomic changes in this long-lived and divergent cell lineage provides an opportunity not only to map the clone’s routes through the Tasmanian landscape but also to investigate its underlying evolutionary processes.\n\nCancer evolves via positive selection acting on somatic genetic changes promoting adaptation to the malignant niche. DFT1 cells have encountered particularly diverse environments during the lineage’s expansion, including those of genetically and immunologically variable devil hosts, different tissues within the host including internal metastases, and even artificial conditions such as laboratory cell culture. The exposure of parallel DFT1 sublineages to such environments creates a natural experiment for observing the evolution of cancer cell adaption. In addition, competition between genetically distinct DFT1 sublineages for a limited host population may drive evolution of traits influencing disease transmission, and tracking the interactions and changing distributions of DFT1 sublineages within and across populations could identify clones with competitive advantage. Here, we document the geographical expansion, genomic alterations, and lineage dynamics of the DFT1 outbreak, providing insight into the evolution of a cancer turned infectious disease.\n\nResults\n\nDFT1 phylogeny and lineage dynamics\n\nWe skim sequenced (approximately 1×) the whole genomes of 648 DFT1 tumours, together with those of their matched hosts, collected throughout Tasmania between 2003 and 2018 (S1 Table). Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called individually on each tumour and then assessed across the panel of tumours and hosts (Methods). A total of 456 SNVs showing phylogenetic signal in tumours and absence in hosts were genotyped using molecular inversion probes (MIPs; median 378× coverage, S2 Table) and, together with 94 somatic mitochondrial mutations and 932 copy number variants (CNVs; S2 and S3 Tables), used to construct a DFT1 phylogenetic tree (Fig 1A and S1 Fig).\n\nThe DFT1 phylogenetic tree reveals a series of early (pre-2003) nodes, which define five tumour groups, named clades A to E. Two clades, D and E, contain only two and one tumours, respectively, and appear to represent divergent DFT1 sublineages which have not persisted (Fig 1A and S1 Fig). Clades A, B, and C, which together represent 99% of tumours in the sample, are each broadly distributed across Tasmania and show distinctive geographical and temporal patterns (Fig 1B and 1C and S2 Fig).\n\nThe distribution of DFT1 clades supports epidemiological evidence suggesting that DFT1 originated in the 1980s or 1990s in north-east Tasmania and first spread rapidly into high-density devil populations in central and eastern areas before a gradual movement towards the more isolated north-west [3,4]. Tumour sublineages that diverged early within all three major clades (A, B, and C) are detectable in the north-east, suggesting that the three clades’ most recent common ancestor may have been located there (Fig 1A and 1B and S1 Fig). After divergence from this common ancestor, clade A split into two sublineages, clades A1 and A2, the former spreading south along the east coast and becoming apparently confined to three south-facing peninsulas and the latter colonising central Tasmania and entering naïve host populations at the north-western and southern disease fronts (Fig 1C). Clade B has widespread presence throughout central, northern, and eastern Tasmania, and clade C has followed a westerly trajectory, spreading out of the north-east and driving DFT1 towards the remote west coast (Fig 1C). The patterns of connectivity within the devil population revealed by DFT1 lineage tracing reflect host genetic substructure and may be explained by geographical features [6–8].\n\nThe interaction between DFT1 clades over time reveals local patterns as well as large-scale trends (Fig 1D). In several populations, clade B has increased in prevalence and replaced clade A (Fig 1D). Sequential lineage replacements have occurred between subgroups of clade A1 (clades A1–3A, A1–3A2, and A1–3A3) isolated on the Forestier Peninsula (Fig 1D), as previously described [9], and may have been due to DFT1 bottlenecks driven by a conservation management trial involving regular removal of diseased animals [10].\n\nDFT1 coinfection, which occurs when individual devils carry genetically distinct DFT1 sublineages from separate exposures, has been observed in devils, but its frequency is unknown [9]. Exactly 100 devils within the cohort hosted two or more sampled DFT1 tumours, and, in 63 of these, the genotypes of these tumours were indistinguishable or could be distinguished only by variation private to the individual (S4 Table). However, tumours in the remaining 37 devils had distinct genotypes, which were also found in tumours affecting other individuals in the population (Fig 1E and S4 Table). Most of this latter set likely represent coinfection, but in some cases, we may have sampled the source of a new genotype. This not only confirms that carrying one DFT1 tumour does not generally protect devils from subsequent infection but also implies that opportunities for within-host competition between sublineages may influence DFT1 evolutionary dynamics [11,12]. To gain insight into the bodily distribution of DFT1 tumours, we superimposed data from 96 DFT1-infected individuals onto a facial map, implicating the lower jaw as the most frequent site of DFT1 tumours (Fig 1F and S3 Fig and S1 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235). Genotyping also identified relationships between primary facial and internal metastatic tumours within individual hosts (S4 Table). Overall, these studies trace the progression of DFT1 over two decades, revealing geographical routes of expansion through Tasmania, patterns of coinfection and metastasis, and the dynamics and persistence of parallel DFT1 strains.\n\nDFT1 copy number variation\n\nTo study genomic heterogeneity within and between DFT1 clades, CNVs were called across the DFT1 tumour cohort using read coverage in 100-kilobase (kb) intervals. We identified 742 CNVs within 567 DFT1 biopsies (CNVs unique to cell lines were excluded), including 315 gains (copy number (CN) &gt;2) and 427 losses (CN &lt;2) (Fig 2A and S3 Table). Most CNVs involved complete gain or loss of a single copy, although some higher amplitude gains, homozygous deletions, and subclonal changes were also observed (Fig 2A and S3 Table). Eight whole genome duplication events [13] were observed across the DFT1 cohort, with some tetraploid lineages persisting through time and others becoming less frequent (S4 Fig). By searching for CNVs common to all tumours, we reconstructed the copy number profile of the most recent common ancestor of the DFT1 cohort, which had a largely unperturbed diploid genome (Fig 2B).\n\nDFT1 gradually acquires CNVs over time, with slight variation between clades and evidence for an early burst prior to 2003 (Fig 2C and S5 Fig). Average diploid DFT1 genome size has remained constant since the emergence of the lineage (S6 Fig). Most DFT1s have a similar number of CNVs; however, several individual tumours carried particularly high CNV burdens, suggesting that they may have undergone sporadic genomic crises or acquired defects in pathways regulating genomic integrity (Fig 2B bottom panel and S1 and S3 Tables). Internal metastases have similar numbers of CNVs to external facial tumours, suggesting that chromosomal instability does not license metastatic spread in DFT1, as has been suggested in some human cancers and model systems (S7 Fig) [14–16]. Some subclonal CNVs were clonal in related tumours occurring in different individuals, suggesting that we sampled the tumour in which the CNV arose (S5 Table). Shared subclones, however, were only detected in two cases of repeated sampling of a single tumour, implying that transmission bottlenecks do not favour the persistence of subclonal cell populations (S5 Table). Overall, these data support the idea that DFT1 is a stable cell lineage that largely maintains its genomic integrity [9,17].\n\nWe constructed a genome map of DFT1 CNVs by superimposing gains and losses identified across the tumour population onto devil chromosomes (Fig 2D). This revealed a significant level of CNV clustering (Fig 2D and 2E). Indeed, some genomic loci were independently focally gained or lost 27 times across the DFT1 biopsy cohort (Fig 2D and S3 Table). Some recurrent CNVs were restricted to individual clades, whereas others were identified across clades (S8 Fig).\n\nRecurrent CNVs may occur due to selection, genome fragility and other processes leading to breakpoint clusters, or chromosomal instability. In order to assess selection, we annotated genes occurring in genomic segments that have been independently gained or lost three or more times within focal (&lt;50 megabase (Mb)) CNVs (Fig 2D and S6 Table). This screen identified PDGFRB, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) whose amplification likely confers a proliferative advantage in DFT1 [18], as a strong candidate for positive selection (Fig 2D and S6 Table). PDGFRB has been independently gained eight times, often at high copy number; interestingly, this has occurred three times in tumours at a single location, the Freycinet Peninsula (S7 Table). Additional recurrent high amplitude focal amplifications were also observed on chromosomes 1, 4, and 5, possibly targeting RTK ligand NRG2, anti-apoptosis factor BIRC5, and DNA-binding protein HMGA2, respectively (Fig 2D and S6 Table). Hemizygous loss of B2M, a component of major histocompatibility complex class I, was observed in all DFT1s except for the single ancestral divergent clade E tumour (Fig 2B), presenting the possibility that this event, which likely confers lower immunogenicity [18,19], may have been favoured in early DFT1 evolution.\n\nChromosomal instability is characterised by repeated gain or loss of individual chromosomes. The recurrent loss of a cassette of genomic loci involving chromosomes 2, 5, and X, an event which has occurred 27 times within the DFT1 biopsy cohort, represents the loss of “marker 5” (M5), a small derived chromosome present in the DFT1 most recent common ancestor (Fig 2F and S3 and S8 Tables) [13,17]. M5 was previously used to define DFT1 karyotypic strains for lineage tracing [13,17], and our finding that this chromosome is frequently lost suggests that reinterpretation of these data may be required (S1 Table). It seems unlikely that M5 loss is under positive selection, given that it encodes few genes with confirmed involvement in cancer (S6 Table), and its loss returns the majority of its sequence to a diploid state; furthermore, two independent instances of M5 gain were also observed (S8 Table). Rather, M5 may be particularly unstable compared with other chromosomes, perhaps due to an inefficient centromere [20–22]. Alternatively, M5 loss may represent a background rate of chromosome nondisjunction, an event which may be poorly tolerated when involving other chromosomes. Interestingly, M5 has been lost more frequently, relative to opportunity, in tetraploid than in diploid DFT1s, even after correcting for ploidy (Fig 2F and S8 Table). The chromosome has also been retained more frequently in clade B compared with other clades (Fig 2F and S8 Table), suggesting that alterations in M5 structure or cell function have promoted this chromosome’s stability within the sublineage.\n\nSome genomic loci are particularly vulnerable to DNA breakage or rearrangement due to processes such as genomic fragility and nonallelic homologous recombination [23,24]. A number of candidate DFT1 sites of genomic instability were identified, including a 12.5-Mb locus on chromosome 5, which was independently gained and lost ten times. A total of 144 genomic breakpoints (at 100-kb resolution) were reused on two or more occasions within the DFT1 lineage (Fig 2D and 2G and S9 Table), although it should be noted that the fragmented state of the reference genome may inflate the number of breakpoint hotspots observed (S3 Table). This contrasted with limited breakpoint reuse in 2,000 neutral simulations (Fig 2G).\n\nSelection and genome instability might also involve common DNA regions in non-DFT1 Tasmanian devil cancers. We investigated this by sequencing genomes from 15 DFT2 tumours (DFT2 is a second Tasmanian devil transmissible cancer that also causes facial tumours [25]) as well as those of ten other spontaneous non-transmissible devil cancers including seven lymphomas and round cell tumours, two anal sac carcinomas, and a single sarcoma (S1 Table). The carcinomas had more than five times more CNVs than other devil cancers, and each harboured high copy number amplicons carrying known cancer genes (PIK3CA and MYCL, respectively), confirming that CNV mutation burden and cancer gene involvement vary across devil cancer histotypes (Fig 2H and S6 Table). In total, 119 CNV breakpoints (at 100-kb resolution) were reused across two or more independent devil cancers (where DFT1 and DFT2 are each considered independent cancers, and each non-DFT tumour is considered an independent cancer), while few were expected by chance (Fig 2I). In some cases, pairs of breakpoints were reused in the same subsets of samples, leading to CNV recurrence (S9 Fig). Many cross-cancer reused breakpoints occurred more than once within DFT1 and likely reflect common genomic unstable sites (Fig 2I and S9 Table).\n\nDFT1 cell culture evolution\n\nLaboratory cell lines can be readily established from DFT1 tumours [13,17]. In order to investigate how DFT1 cells adapt to cell culture conditions, we sequenced genomes from 24 cell lines derived from diverse DFT1 tumours across the lineage’s phylogeny (Fig 3A and S1 Table). We observed that DFT1 cell lines have significantly more CNVs than DFT1 primary tumours (Fig 3B). In fact, 421 of 1,163 (36%) CNVs identified in DFT1 were unique to cell lines, while cell lines constituted only 6% of samples (S3 Table). Additionally, M5 loss is significantly more frequent in cell lines than in tumour tissue biopsies (Fig 3C). Altogether, this suggests that introduction to cell culture may select for genetically unstable DFT1 subclones, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these observations could result from relaxation of negative selection in DFT1 cell culture.\n\nWe generated a chromosomal map displaying the distribution of genomic gains and losses in DFT1 cell lines (Fig 3D). Remarkably, this revealed that the majority of DFT1 cell lines have undergone a series of highly distinctive genomic rearrangements (Fig 3D and S10 Table). These most prominently include losses involving chromosome 4, returning a region gained to three copies early in DFT1 evolution (see Fig 2B) back to two copies and gains involving chromosome 5. These changes were also observed in cell lines derived from tetraploid lineages, and losses and gains of a single copy of regions of chromosomes 4 and 5 were observed in these cases. In four low-passage cell lines, these changes were subclonal, suggesting ongoing evolution in vitro. The phylogenetic distribution of these cell lines on the DFT1 tree confirms that the recurrent alterations do not result from accidental laboratory contamination (Fig 3A). Furthermore, these changes were specific to DFT1, as they were not observed in cultured devil fibroblasts or in DFT2 cell lines (S2 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235). To determine whether the cell line–specific genomic changes were compatible with growth within an animal host, we examined nine tumours derived from sequenced cell lines that had been experimentally introduced into devils [26]. In all of these cases, the cell line genomic configuration was retained in transplanted tumours (Fig 3E).\n\nWe annotated the genes present within genomic regions recurrently gained and lost in DFT1 cell lines to identify potential underlying drivers. Surprisingly, ERBB2, whose activity is necessary for DFT1 growth [18,27], lies on the arm of chromosome 4 whose third copy is repeatedly lost in cell lines (Fig 3D), indicating that the selective advantage of undergoing this change exceeds the cost of losing a copy of ERBB2. Chromosome 5p, which is repeatedly gained in cell lines, carries the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus [28], raising the possibility that increased ribosome abundance may offer an advantage to DFT1 cells in vitro (Fig 3D). SNV allele assignment revealed that the chromosomal copies implicated in the events on chromosomes 4 and 5 varied among tumours, indicating that the selective advantage is not allele specific (S10 Fig and S11 Table). Intriguingly, we identified two DFT1 biopsies, one a lung metastasis, with equivalent losses on chromosome 4 and gains on chromosome 5, suggesting that some DFT1 body sites may mimic cell culture conditions, driving DFT1 adaptation (S11 Fig and S10 Table). Overall, these observations reveal that some cancers respond to altered environments in a highly reproducible manner, indicating that the pathways to achieving fitness optima are, in some cases, surprisingly limited.\n\nDFT1 telomeres\n\nDFT1 chromosomes have short telomeres compared with those of normal devil cells, but the cancer is known to express telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT [29,30] (S12 Fig). To investigate if DFT1 telomere length changes with time, we measured the abundance of telomeric repeats in DFT1 biopsy genomes using tumour purity as a covariate in a linear regression model. This assay suggests that DFT1 telomere length has remained unchanged in tumours sampled between 2003 and 2018 (S12 Fig). These results imply that DFT1 telomeres shortened either before or soon after DFT1 neoplastic transformation; indeed, critically short telomeres may have contributed to the chromosomal rearrangements observed in the cancer [17,31]. Subsequently, telomere lengths have remained constant, probably due to the activity of telomerase.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis survey of DFT1 genomic diversity reveals a stable neoplastic cell lineage that has altered relatively little during its spread through the Tasmanian devil population [9,13,17]. Indeed, more genetic variation, at least at the level of copy number, is frequently found between distinct tumours of a cancer within an individual human patient or even within a single human tumour [15,32–36] than is present in DFT1s sampled from devils hundreds of kilometres and more than a decade apart. These findings suggest that early in its evolution, at least at the common ancestor of clades A, B, C, and D, DFT1 acquired a genomic configuration compatible with growth within a range of environments, including those of genetically and immunologically variable devil hosts and internal metastatic sites.\n\nNevertheless, despite exceptional adaptation to its niche, there is some evidence of ongoing positive selection in DFT1. Repeated focal and high amplitude copy number gains involving the PDGFRB locus suggest selection for increased cell proliferation [18,37]. Surprisingly, given evidence for strong selective pressures exerted by the host immune system [38], we did not identify obvious recurrent genomic changes contributing to immune evasion. Such adaptations may not be copy number driven or may involve poorly assembled or annotated portions of the reference genome. However, the potential for DFT1 to adapt to novel conditions is clear from the convergent structural changes observed in DFT1 cell lines. Given the declining density of devils, particularly in eastern and central Tasmania [4], as well as evidence for high frequency of DFT1 coinfection, there is scope for DFT1 inter-lineage competition. Our observation that clade B has largely remained behind the disease front and repeatedly replaced other DFT1 sublineages raises the possibility that this clade may have a selective advantage, perhaps, for example, favouring transmission in post-disease low-density devil populations, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these dynamics are stochastic. Additionally, repeated acquisition of PDGFRB copy number gains in tumours of different clades on the Freycinet Peninsula, coinciding with steady devil population decline [39], suggests the possibility of an arms race towards more virulent DFT1 forms driven by within-host inter-lineage competition. These findings contrast with the absence of detectable ongoing positive selection in the 6,000-year-old canine transmissible venereal tumour [40], perhaps reflecting differences in age and within-host inter-lineage competitive dynamics between the two cancers.\n\nAlthough positive selection continues to mould the DFT1 genome, most genetic alterations in DFT1 are unlikely to offer an advantage. Indeed, the gradual accumulation of mutations may, in the long term, reduce the lineage’s robustness, especially given evidence that negative selection may be inefficient in transmissible cancers [40]. Any potential costs of continued clonal evolution are, however, unlikely to affect the immediate consequences of DFT1 on its precarious host population.\n\nDFT1 presents a continued and serious threat to the Tasmanian devil, and predicting the future impact of the disease remains challenging [5,41–43]. The spatial and temporal dynamics of DFT1 between 2003 and 2018, described here, reveal not only the trajectories of parallel and competing DFT1 sublineages but also trace the patterns of movement of the diseased devils themselves. In combination with findings from ongoing population monitoring studies [4,38,39,44–46], these data may be useful for epidemiological modelling and prediction of management intervention benefit. The recent emergence of DFT2 [25,45] further exacerbates the species’ peril and underlines the importance of conservation efforts.\n\nOverall, we have described the phylogeny, lineage dynamics, geographical spread, and genome evolution of DFT1, providing important information for future Tasmanian devil conservation planning and illustrating how a comparatively simple and stable cancer cell lineage can colonise diverse niches and devastate a species.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics statement\n\nAnimal procedures and sample collection followed a standard operating procedure that was approved by the General Manager of the Natural and Cultural Heritage Division in the Tasmanian Government Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and the Environment (DPIPWE), in agreement with the DPIPWE Animal Ethics Committee and covered by a Scientific Permit issued by the Tasmanian Government, or were approved under University of Tasmania Animal Ethics Permits A009215, A0011436, A0013685, A0012513, A0014976, A0010296, A0013326, and A0016789 with State Scientific Permit TFA 19144. Sample collection procedures were approved by the University of Cambridge Department of Veterinary Medicine Ethics and Welfare Committee (CR191).\n\nSample collection and DNA extraction\n\nBiopsies were collected from wild or captive Tasmanian devils or from animals whose carcasses were found as roadkill. Tumour and host (ear, liver, spleen, blood, gonad, or submandibular lymph node) tissue biopsies were collected into either RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United States of America) or ethanol. Fine needle aspirates were collected into a 1:1 solution of Buffer AL (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany): PBS were sampled from tumours that were too small to biopsy. Cell lines were established and cultured as previously described [13,17,18]. Experiments involving inoculation of devils with DFT1 cell lines have been described [26]. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Samples included in the study, as well as metadata for identifying samples used in various analyses, are listed in S1 Table. Cell lines used in the study are also known by the following external identifiers: 85T (Half-Pea); 86T, 86T2 (1426); 87T, 87T2, 90T, 90T2, 114T, 363T1, 993T1.1, 993T1.2, 994T1.1, 995T1.1, 995T1.2, 996T1, 996T2 (C5065); 88T, 88T2 (4906); 204T (Ed); 202T2 (RV, TD467); 203T3 (SN, TD500). Groups of samples belonging to the same parental cell line were sampled at different passages or after inoculation into devil hosts (details in S1 Table).\n\nSequencing\n\nIllumina whole genome sequencing libraries were generated with an average insert size of 450 base pairs (bp) using standard methods according to manufacturer’s instructions, and were tagged with Sanger index tags for multiplexing. We pooled and sequenced approximately 17 samples per lane on an Illumina HiSeq instrument with version 4 chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, USA) in high output mode with paired-ends (2 × 125 bp) to achieve a median coverage of 1× per sample. Reads were aligned to the Devil7.1+MT Tasmanian devil reference genome (http://www.ensembl.org/Sarcophilus_harrisii/Info/Index) [9] using BWA-MEM (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) version 0.5.9-r16+rugo with options “-l 32 -t 6.” PCR duplicates were flagged using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).\n\nNote on Tasmanian devil chromosome nomenclature\n\nTwo Tasmanian devil chromosome nomenclature systems are in use, which differ in the naming of the two largest chromosomes [1,17]. In both systems, the two largest chromosomes are named 1 and 2, but the labels for these chromosomes are swapped with respect to each other. The Devil7.1+MT reference genome [9], used here, follows the system established by Pearse and Swift [1].\n\nVariant calling and genotyping\n\nMitochondrial variant calling and filtering\n\nMitochondrial DNA was sequenced to a median depth of 275×. Mitochondrial variant calling and genotyping was performed with Platypus (version 0.8.1) [47]. First, we called SNVs on each sample individually using default settings with “—minRead = 3” and “—minPosterior = 0.” We merged variants and ran Platypus a second time across all samples. We then removed any variants with flags “badRead,” mapping quality (“MQ”), or quality depth (“QD”).\n\nWe applied the following post-processing filters to the remaining variants:\n\nRegions filter: Variants mapping within 500 bp from the start or end of the mitochondrial contig were excluded.\n\nLow Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) filter: Variants observed with VAF &lt;0.2 were discarded, as they were considered to be likely due to low-level cross-contamination.\n\nGermline filter: Variants appearing in both tumour and matched host were discarded as likely germline contamination. In tumours without matched hosts, variants that had been discarded in ≥1 matched tumour were discarded.\n\nWe visually validated remaining variants using Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) version 2.3 [48].\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) purity was estimated as the mean VAF of tumour-specific mtDNA variants (S1 Table).\n\nMitochondrial haplotype nomenclature\n\nWe created an mtDNA haplotype nomenclature. Each name begins with a prefix identifying the clone: The DFT1 clone is denoted as “DFT1_,” and DFT2 is denoted as “DFT2_.” A hierarchical notation is then used, which follows the mitochondrial tree topology, alternating between numbers and letters (S1 and S2 Tables).\n\nNuclear variant calling and filtering\n\nScaffolds from each chromosome in the reference genome Devil7.1+MT (http://www.ensembl.org/Sarcophilus_harrisii/Info/Index) were concatenated to produce chromosome-level coordinates for each chromosome (S12 Table).\n\nSNV calling and genotyping were performed with Platypus version 0.8.1 [47] with options “—minRead = 1,” “—minBaseQual = 30,” “—badReadsThreshold = 30,” “—filteredReadsFrac = .8,” “—badReadsWindow = 15,” “—minPosterior = 0,” and “—minFlank = 0.” For the initial calling, we used Platypus with the parameters described above to identify SNVs in each DFT1 separately. Variants flagged by Platypus as badReads, MQ, strandBias, Median minimum base quality for bases around variant (MMLQ) &lt;30, and sequence context (SC) were removed. For the variant set called in each sample, we applied the following filters:\n\nRegions filter: We excluded variants mapping within 500 bp of the start or end of a contig and within 1,000 bp from the start and end of a scaffold. Variants called in scaffolds not assigned to chromosomes and in mtDNA were also removed.\n\nSimple repeats filter: Variants called within 5 bp from a simple repeat region as annotated by Tandem Repeat Finder [49] were removed.\n\nEach tumour’s SNV set was then genotyped in its respective matched host (or a single host, 100H, if matched host was unavailable, S1 Table), and variants identified in host were excluded. We then merged remaining variants into a single file and genotyped this across all tumours and normals using Platypus with default settings but retaining the “—minReads = 1” option. Variants flagged with MQ or badReads were excluded, and we retained those variants with support (≥1 reads) in DFT1s but without support (0 reads) in normal devils.\n\nPreliminary phylogenetic tree inference and MIP probe selection\n\nWe generated a custom sequence template that concatenated Devil7.1+MT to only include sites where variants were observed. The IUPAC ambiguity character (N) was substituted at sites where there was no read coverage across the variant position in a particular sample. We combined the sequences of genotyped tumours and the reference to generate a sequence alignment for phylogenetic tree inference. We constructed a preliminary maximum likelihood tree rooted with the reference sequence, using the generalised time reversible (GTR) substitution model with a gamma model of site heterogeneity with Lewis ascertainment bias correction implemented in RAxML [50]. Using DFT1 mtDNA haplotypes and the preliminary nuclear SNV tree, we placed tumours into preliminary phylogenetic groups. The SNV set was further filtered based on these groups in order to select phylogenetically informative SNVs. A total of 600 SNVs were selected for genotyping using MIPs.\n\nMIP genotyping\n\nWe designed custom MIP capture probes with a 120-bp target capture size using MIPgen [51]. The common linker sequence CTTCAGCTTCCCGATATCCGACGGTAGTGT was replaced with CTTCAGCTTCCCGATCCGCTCTTCCGATCT to enable amplification with Sanger iPCR indexed primers (96-Plex Molecular Barcoding for the Illumina Genome Analyzer https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-61779-089-8_20). We selected 600 probes which passed the recommended scoring thresholds (&gt;1.4 using the support vector regression model and 0.7 using the logistic regression model). The oligos were column synthesised and purified using standard desalting (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, USA). We first pooled the probes at equimolar concentration. We phosphorylated the pooled MIP probes using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) with conditions detailed in Table 1 with incubation at 37°C for 45 minutes followed by heat inactivation at 65°C for 20 minutes.\n\nGenomic DNA was diluted to 3 ng/μL, and phosphorylated pooled MIP probes were diluted in EB buffer (Qiagen) to enable a reaction ratio of MIP probes to genome copies of 800:1. The hybridisation and circularisation reactions were performed as shown in Table 2 using Ampligase (LGC Biosearch Technologies, Hoddesdon, United Kingdom) and Hemo Klentaq (New England Biolabs).\n\nDNA was denatured at 98°C for 3 minutes. Temperature was decreased incrementally (1°C per second) to 60°C, held for 1 hour, and the reaction incubated overnight at 56°C. To select for the circularised product, we performed an exonuclease treatment (Exonuclease I and Exonuclease III (New England Biolabs)) with the conditions described in Table 3.\n\nThe capture reaction was incubated in the exonuclease mix at 37°C for 40 minutes followed by 95°C for 2 minutes to heat inactivate the exonuclease. We then amplified (Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, New England Biolabs) our selected product with the MIP forward primer (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACATACGAGATCCGTAATCGGGAAGCTGAA*G-3′) together with iPCR indexed primers with the conditions specified in Tables 4 and 5.\n\nLibrary quality was analysed directly on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) using the Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Broad Range chip. Libraries were pooled (5 μL of each library) and size-selected (&gt;150 bp) using Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) at 0.8×. The purified pooled library was eluted in 22-μl buffer EB (Qiagen) and assessed using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies).\n\nWe first performed a pilot with 96 samples, sequencing the libraries on a MiSeq (Reagent Kit v3 600-cycle, Illumina) with 150 bp paired-end reads. We demultiplexed and trimmed adaptors using bcl2fastq2 v2.20 (https://support.illumina.com/downloads/bcl2fastq-conversion-software-v2-20.html), allowing for no mismatches (“—barcode-mismatches 0”). We then aligned the reads using BWA-MEM (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) to Devil7.1+MT. Using a customised script based on Allelecount (https://github.com/cancerit/alleleCount) with min-base-qual = 30, we identified the total number of reads covering the region of the SNV, the number of reads supporting each allele, and the number of reads carrying a 5-bp unique molecular identifier (UMI). We calculated the on-target ratios of each probe by calculating the number of unique reads that mapped to the correct genomic region as a proportion of the total number of reads that carried either or both the extension and ligation sequences of each probe. We removed overrepresented probes that were greater than 1.5 log(10)-fold from the overall median UMI read count across samples and probes, and we removed probes with no representation. We also removed probes that carried greater than 50% median off-target ratios across the samples. The MIP probe concentration for rebalancing was calculated by taking the square root of the median coverage over the median coverage for the individual MIPs. Remaining probes were rebalanced and pooled using an Echo 550 Liquid Handler (Labcyte, San Jose, USA). Using the rebalanced MIP probes, we remade and sequenced the new libraries for the same set of 96 samples. From the analysis, we observed that two probes were over 10-fold higher than the overall median UMI read count across probes. We halved the volume of these two probes for the input pool using the same rebalanced concentration. We re-pooled the remaining MIP probes and genotyped across the samples (S2 Table).\n\nSeveral tumours were sequenced in duplicate, and in these cases, data were merged from the two sequencing runs. We assessed the number of reads supporting the reference and variant alleles at each target site as detailed above (S2 Table). We then genotyped variant presence or absence as follows:\n\nCalculate the expected number of reads for presence: The expected number of reads supporting a variant for a diploid site carrying a heterozygous somatic variant was calculated as follows:\n\nPurity was defined as the median VAF*2 for variants that pass a minimum threshold of variant read support. The accuracy of this approach was validated by visualising VAF histograms for each sample.\n\nGenotyping: Genotyping was then performed as follows:\n\nExpected number of reads ≥10:\n\nIf the observed number of reads supporting a variant was greater than the contamination threshold (a value calculated individually for each tumour based on the level of cross-contamination (S2 Table)), the variant was considered present.\n\nIf the number of reads supporting a variant was less than the contamination threshold, but &gt;2 reads, the variant was assigned an ambiguity code “N.”\n\nIf the number of supporting reads was ≤2, the variant was considered absent.\n\nExpected number of reads &lt;10 but ≥5:\n\nIf the number of supporting reads was greater than the contamination threshold, the variant was considered present.\n\nIf the number of reads supporting the variant was less than the contamination threshold, the variant was assigned an ambiguity code “N.”\n\nExpected number of reads &lt;5:\n\nThe variant was assigned an ambiguity code “N.”\n\nWe excluded variants observed to be present in normal tissue from one or more devils from downstream analyses. We further pruned the filtered set of variants by excluding any variant for which more than 50% samples were assigned the ambiguity code “N.” We additionally removed any tumours where more than 50% variants were assigned the ambiguity code “N.”\n\nCopy number calling\n\nFor autosomes, we counted read depth in adjacent 100-kb genomic bins across Devil7.1+MT, excluding the last bin of each scaffold as well as short (&lt;100 kb) and unplaced scaffolds. Additionally, the short scaffolds placed towards the end of each autosome were excluded, as specified in [18]. For chr X, which is enriched for short scaffolds, we first concatenated scaffolds prior to bin counting and did not exclude the last bin of each scaffold. Scaffolds beyond position chrX:54800000 (S12 Table) were excluded. Bin counts were normalised by log2 transforming the ratio of read depth within each bin to median autosomal read depth in the panel of normal (PON) genomes (LogR). Normal devil genomes were pooled into a PON and used to denoise tumours using tangent principal component analysis (PCA) normalisation (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593691-DenoiseReadCounts). LogR plots (tumours), raw read depth plots (normal devils), and raw read count per bin (tumours and normal devils) are available in S2–S4 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235, respectively.\n\nPurity calculation\n\nTumour purity was calculated using copy number features as follows. We estimated purity (⍴) using average read depth calculated in 10-kb intervals with a 5-kb slide across the genome (rgenome) and genomic regions that have lost either 1 (rLOH) or both (rHomdel) copies in all DFT1 or DFT2 tumours. These regions were identified by assessing copy number states through nonoverlapping 10-kb windows across targeted scaffolds (Table 6). The following formula was used, where n and k represent the number of homdel and LOH regions used to estimate purity, respectively.\n\nSee S12 Table for equivalence of scaffold names. Purity was also estimated from MIP genotypes, as described above in section “MIP genotyping.” The mean of both methods was used in downstream analyses. Purity estimates obtained from both methods are available in S1 Table.\n\nCopy number segmentation\n\nLogR profiles were segmented using both piecewise constant fitting (pcf) and multiple-sample pcf (multipcf), implemented in R [52]. multipcf was run on groups of tumours with shared mtDNA haplotypes (S1 Table). If pcf and multipcf segments within a single tumour shared a copy number state (see below) and overlapped across &gt;95% of their length, they were merged, and multipcf breakpoints retained. The union of pcf and multipcf segments was further filtered by merging adjacent segments whose read depth dispersions were not significantly different (p = 0.05) using Ansari–Bradley and Wilcoxon tests (https://rdrr.io/bioc/aCGH/). Non-copy number 2 (CN2) segments called in different tumours were merged if they overlapped across &gt;95% of their length and had breakpoints within 500 kb of each other. In these cases, breakpoints were consolidated to the median position of observed breakpoints. Finally, segments &lt;500 kb were discarded. Each tumour’s segments were visually inspected and validated (S2 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235). Breakpoints were screened for absence in the set of normal devil genomes (S3 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235).\n\nCopy number assignment\n\nThe copy number associated with each segment was estimated using two models: a Bayesian hierarchical model implemented in JAGS (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~nicholls/MScMCMC15/jags_user_manual.pdf) and a Poisson logit-linked general linear model implemented in R.\n\nBayesian hierarchical copy number assignment. The read depth of a segment (rs) can be estimated by the sample’s ploidy (⍦) and purity (⍴), defined as the proportion of tumour cells in a sample, as well as the segment’s copy number state (Eq 1) [53]. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Gibbs sampler implemented in JAGS (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~nicholls/MScMCMC15/jags_user_manual.pdf) to fit the read depths of segments in each tumour and to obtain estimates of a tumour’s purity and ploidy and calculate copy number states. For DFT1 tumours, we estimated purity through DFT1-specific regions of deletions in the genome and MIPs data (see above). We used the average of these tumour purity measurements to initialise the tumour purity parameter of the model. Rearranging the formula in Eq 1, we then used the optimised tumour purity and ploidy estimates and the read depths of the segments to assign copy number to the segments (Eq 2).\n\nPoisson model for copy number assignment. As a cross-validation measure, we obtained the idealised logR for copy number states 1 to 9 using the tumour purity and ploidy estimates using Eq 1 and generated a Poisson mixture model implemented in R to compute the probability that given its read depth, a segment will be of a particular copy number state. The base assumption in this model is that copy number state (n) scales linearly with read coverage (k) (Eq 3). To calculate expected read coverage states for this model, we first calculated the average read coverage of the segments that were assigned as CN2 by the previous copy number assignment model (k̃). We then inferred the expected read coverage of the other copy number states, multiplying the predicted read coverage by the tumour purity (⍴) to account for host contamination. We assume that the read coverage distribution within copy number states is under a log-gamma distribution. Using the Poisson mixture model, we then assigned each segment to the copy number state that had the highest probability (Eq 4).\n\nDiscrepancies between copy number assignments using the two methods due to low sequencing quality and subclonality were manually validated based on raw read coverage. To further remove false positive breakpoints, adjacent segments that were assigned the same copy number state were merged. Copy number states in all tumours were visually inspected and validated (S2 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235) and mtDNA and MIP phylogenetic trees were used to identify and split recurrent CNVs and to infer back mutations.\n\nWhole genome duplication was inferred using karyotype information (S1 Table), together with observations of CNV copy number states.\n\nPhylogenetic tree\n\nThe phylogenetic tree of DFT1 tumours was inferred jointly from three sources of sequence data: SNVs of the nuclear genome derived from MIP sequencing, mtDNA SNVs and binary presence-absence information corresponding to the CNVs observed in each sample. CNVs associated with M5 and high copy number amplicons were excluded from tree inference. The data were analysed using IQ-TREE 1.6.12 [54], under an edge-linked proportional partition model (-spp option) [55], in which each of the three data sources formed a subset of the partition, to which was assigned its own substitution model. The substitution model for each subset was chosen using IQ-TREE’s model selection procedure (-m MF option) [56], with the following results: MIP SNVs were analysed using K2P+ASC+R2, mtDNA SNVs were analysed using TIM2e+ASC, and CNVs were analysed using GTR2+FO+ASC+R3. Branch support was assessed using IQ-TREE’s ultra-fast bootstrap [57] with 1,000 replicates (-bb 1,000 option). The devil reference sequence (Devil7.1+MT) was used as an out-group to root the tree.\n\nTwo tree search strategies were employed in the phylogenetic analysis: one in which all candidate trees must conform to a topological constraint (using the -g option of IQ-TREE) [58] and an unconstrained tree search. The topology constraint used was to enforce the samples’ preassigned membership to clades A1, A2, B, C, D, and E, based on mtDNA haplotypes and presence of clade-specific SNVs from low coverage whole genome sequencing data (this was relevant for samples missing MIPs data (S1 Table)), as well as to group samples 332T and 471T1, which share an mtDNA haplotype, but 471T1 is missing MIPs data. We ran 20 independent runs for each strategy. We used the approximately unbiased (AU) test [59] to identify any trees that were statistically significantly worse than the maximum likelihood tree among the set. The highest likelihood constrained tree not rejected by the AU test is presented in Figs 1 and 3 and S1 Fig.\n\nClade group assignment\n\nWe assigned tumours to 37 “clade groups” (S1 Table and S1 Fig) based on position in a phylogenetic tree constructed from MIP and mtDNA genotypes. These were designated with a numeric suffix after specifying the clade (A1, A2, B, and C), e.g., Clade_A1-1, Clade_A1-2, etc. One clade B cell line, 204T, lacked MIPs data and could not be confidently placed within a group; it was therefore assigned its own group, Clade_B-204T. Clade groups and phylogenetic position within the MIPs+mtDNA tree were used to identify CNV recurrence and back mutation.\n\nCNV rate and genome size variation rate\n\nThe accumulation of CNVs with time was plotted using the R package ggplot2. Data were analysed using a linear model; concretely, the lm() function and prediction intervals were inferred by the predict() function implemented in the R programming language. Models were inferred for the relationship between the number of CNVs and the sampling date and for the number of CNVs and the interaction between the sampling date and the DFT1 clade. The significance of the interaction with clade was assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), through the Anova() function in the R package “car,” and contrasts between pairs of clades were assessed using the emtrends() function in the R package estimated marginal means (“emmeans”). Sets of CNVs which cooccur with the same copy number in the same samples are counted once (see Total_CNVs_linked.clonal_copynumbers_only in S1 Table). We corrected for ploidy in tetraploid tumours (CNVs occurring after whole genome duplication were counted as half a CNV, as there is twice as much DNA in which CNVs can occur after this event). Exact sampling dates were unavailable for 23 samples, although the year of sampling was recorded; for these samples, a random date from the year of sampling was used when calculating the regression.\n\nDiploid DFT1 genome size rate of change with time was analysed as follows. Genome size change was calculated for each tumour by subtracting the “total genome affected loss” from the “total genome affected gain” where “total genome affected gain” and “total genome affected loss” are the sum of the widths of the copy number gain and copy number loss CNVs present in each sample, respectively (S1 Table). Genome size per sample is calculated as 2*haploid genome size + genome size change, where callable haploid genome size was estimated as 2,625,758,988 bp (this excluded regions of the genome which were excluded from copy number analysis, see above). The rate of change of diploid DFT1 genome size due to copy number variation over time was estimated by robust regression, implemented in the R package MASS, in the function rlm. The “Genome size” response was regressed on the sampling date for each sample. Non-DFT1s, duplicate samples from the same tumour, cell lines, and tetraploid tumours were excluded from this analysis, as were CNVs with subclonal copy number states. Exact sampling dates were unavailable for 23 samples, although the year of sampling was recorded; for these samples, a random date from the year of sampling was used when calculating the regression.\n\nAllelic copy number\n\nWe estimated allelic copy number by intersecting CNV and MIP coordinates. CNV–MIP combinations were only retained if the MIP alternative allele was either present in the tumour(s) carrying the CNV (gains) or inferred to be present in an ancestor tumour (losses). CNV–MIP combinations were further filtered for those that overlapped with 2 or more independent CNVs to assess whether specific alleles are involved in recurrent CNVs.\n\nEach MIP position has an associated estimated total copy number and an observed VAF, and each sample has an estimated purity; these values are used to estimate the genotype. For a given total copy number, we construct an array of potential genotypes, in half-integer intervals, to test. For example, for a total copy number of 2, we would test the genotypes 0.0|2.0, 0.5|1.5, 1.0|1.0, 1.5|0.5, and 2.0|0.0, where the genotype is written in the format “R|A,” with R meaning “reference allele” and A meaning “alternative allele.” We calculate the expected VAF for each genotype as\n\nwhere H and T represent the copy number in the host and tumour, respectively, and the subscripts Ref, Alt, and Total designate that the copy number refers to the reference or alternative allele or is the total copy number, and p is the sample purity. For the MIP positions under consideration, HAlt = 0 and HRef = 2. The genotype which minimised the absolute difference between expected and observed VAF was selected as the best fit allele-specific copy number genotype at the MIP position for the sample (S11 Table).\n\nTo further validate the finding that any copy of chromosome 4 can be lost in the back mutations of CNVs 3R1 and 9 commonly observed in DFT1 cell lines, we performed capillary sequencing of four variant loci occurring within the footprints of CNVs 3R1 and 9 (S11 Table). All four SNVs were inferred to be present in the DFT1 most recent common ancestor. The following primers were used to amplify these loci as approximately 400 bp amplicons in whole genome amplified DFT1 biopsy or cell line genomic DNA:\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000112:154498 forward: GAGAAGAAAGGGGAGAAGAAATACTAC\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000112:154498 reverse: AATATAAGGCTACCCACAAACTACCAC\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000265:1474441 forward: GAAAACTCTTCTGGTTACCATGTACTC\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000265:1474441 reverse: GGAAAATAGAGAAAGAAGAGTCCTACC\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000109:783087 forward: CTACTATCATACAGAATACCTGCTGGA\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000109:783087 reverse: GTCTTCCTCAAATATAACCTCAGACAC\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000268:868897 forward: GACCTGATCTTAGTAAGGAACTAGGAA\n\nChr4_supercontig_000000268:868897 reverse: ATTCACAGAACTTAGATTGAGTACCCC\n\nPCRs were performed in 40-μl reactions with the following reagents: 8-μl 5× Phusion HF Reaction Buffer (New England Biolabs), 4-μl DNA template, 0.8-μM dNTP mix (New England Biolabs), 0.8-μM forward primer, 0.8-μM reverse primer, and 2.5-U Phusion HF DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Thermal cycling was performed as follows: 3:30 minutes at 94°C, then 30 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 60°C, 30 seconds at 72°C, followed by 5 minutes at 72°C using an Eppendorf thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Genotypes were called manually by viewing electropherograms using Geneious R9 software (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand).\n\nSimulated CNV distributions\n\nWe assessed whether the observed overlap of independent CNVs was statistically greater or less than expected by chance. We sampled random regions from the genome that matched the sizes of the observed CNVs identified in DFT1s and assessed their overlaps. We performed 2,000 permutations to simulate the null hypothesis that the occurrence of observed CNVs in our set was not associated with genomic position. For the simulation, the genome was circularised in numerical order such that the end of a chromosome is connected to the start of the next, higher number chromosome; the end of chromosome X is linked to the start of chromosome 1. For each observed CNV, the start position was randomly resampled from all available genome positions, and the end position of the CNV was updated to a position downstream of the new start position such that the original CNV length was maintained.\n\nVisualisation of clade spread\n\nWe used a customised R script using the R package “ggplot2” to overlay a plot of the coordinates of each sample to a map of Tasmania (https://library.unimelb.edu.au/collections/map_collection/map_collection_outline_maps) to assess the spread of each identified clade.\n\nTelomere repeat abundance analysis\n\nTelomere repeat abundance was estimated from binary sequencing alignment map (BAM) files using a modified version of telseq version 0.0.1 [60], using merged read groups and a read length of 125, appropriate for the sequencing technology used (-m -r 125 option). We modified parameters in the telseq source code to adapt it for the devil genome, which include read length, total GC content (bp), and number of chromosomal ends. The number of chromosomal ends was specified as 1 in order to obtain a measure of overall telomere repeat abundance rather than an estimate of telomere length. The modified source code is available at https://github.com/TransmissibleCancerGroup/telseq.\n\nThe relationship between the estimated telomere length and the year of sampling was estimated using a generalised linear model, using a log-linked gamma distribution to model errors and to reflect that the length estimates can only take positive values. The implementation used was the glm() function in the R programming language. “Telomere length” estimated by telseq is the cumulative length of telomere repeats and will include interstitial telomere repeats.\n\nDFT1 face maps\n\nDFT1 tumour images from confirmed DFT1s (S1 Table) were used to construct DFT1 face and body maps. Facial and body tumour contours from photographs or field notes were hand drawn onto devil face and body templates using Krita software (Krita, Deventer, the Netherlands) on a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet (Kazo, Japan). We generated a custom python script using “matplotlib” and “opencv” packages to stack the tumour contour diagrams and to quantify the density of tumour occurrence across the devil face and body (Fig 1F and S1 Data in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4046235).\n\nComputer code\n\nCustom software and code associated with this study are available in the repository (https://github.com/TransmissibleCancerGroup/TCG_2020_devil_paper).\n\nSupporting information"
