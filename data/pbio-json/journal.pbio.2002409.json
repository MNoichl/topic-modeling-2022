  "fullText": "PLOS and the PLOS Biology team would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who lent us their expertise as an academic editor, as a guest editor or as a peer reviewer in 2016. We are fully dependent on the voluntary efforts of these experts to publish the journal for the academic community. Over the past year, PLOS Biology relied on 286 academic and guest editors to manage the more than 2,000 articles submitted to the journal, which were assessed by 1,285 reviewers. Their efforts enabled the publication of more than 170 rigorous, Open Access papers.\n\nThe names of our 2016 editors that handled submitted manuscripts appear in the Supporting Information as S1 Editor List and as S1 Guest Editor List. Our reviewers appear in the Supporting Information as S1 Reviewer List. We are grateful for their dedication, generosity, and support of Open Access science. Thank you all.\n\nSupporting information"
