  "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant infections kill approximately 23,000 people and cost $20,000,000,000 each year in the United States alone despite the widespread use of small-molecule antimicrobial combination therapy. Antibiotic combinations typically have an additive effect: the efficacy of the combination matches the sum of the efficacies of each antibiotic when used alone. Small molecules can also act synergistically when the efficacy of the combination is greater than the additive efficacy. However, synergistic combinations are rare and have been historically difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs is limited by the scale of potential combinations: a modest collection of 1,000 small molecules involves 1 million pairwise combinations. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for rapid identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs, the overlap2 method (O2M). O2M extracts patterns from chemical-genetic datasets, which are created when a collection of mutants is grown in the presence of hundreds of different small molecules, producing a precise set of phenotypes induced by each small molecule across the mutant set. The identification of mutants that show the same phenotype when treated with known synergistic molecules allows us to pinpoint additional molecule combinations that also act synergistically. As a proof of concept, we focus on combinations with the antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfamethizole, which had been standard treatment against urinary tract infections until widespread resistance decreased efficacy. Using O2M, we screened a library of 2,000 small molecules and identified several that synergize with the antibiotic trimethoprim and/or sulfamethizole. The most potent of these synergistic interactions is with the antiviral drug azidothymidine (AZT). We then demonstrate that understanding the molecular mechanism underlying small-molecule synergistic interactions allows the rational design of additional combinations that bypass drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulfamethizole are both folate biosynthesis inhibitors. We find that this activity disrupts nucleotide homeostasis, which blocks DNA replication in the presence of AZT. Building on these data, we show that other small molecules that disrupt nucleotide homeostasis through other mechanisms (hydroxyurea and floxuridine) also act synergistically with AZT. These novel combinations inhibit the growth and virulence of trimethoprim-resistant clinical Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, suggesting that they may be able to be rapidly advanced into clinical use. In sum, we present a generalizable method to screen for novel synergistic combinations, to identify particular mechanisms resulting in synergy, and to use the mechanistic knowledge to rationally design new combinations that bypass drug resistance.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nSmall-molecule antimicrobial therapy facilitated one of the greatest increases in lifespan in history but is endangered by the rise of antimicrobial-resistant “superbugs” [1]. The CDC estimates that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause more than 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths annually in the United States alone [2]. Combating antibiotic resistance requires a regular supply of new antimicrobial drugs, as bacteria inevitably acquire resistance to any single drug. Two main approaches are commonly used to identify additional antibiotics: new drug discovery and repurposing of drugs already approved for other conditions [3–6]. New drugs are more likely to result in breakthroughs but require a large upfront capital investment in time-consuming clinical trials. Repurposing can move drugs into the clinic without extensive trials but will not identify novel drug classes or structures [7].\n\nThis study explores a third strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance: synergistic combination therapy. Synergy occurs when 2 drugs act together with efficacy beyond the additive effect of each drug on its own [8]. Since synergistic drug pairs can kill microbes that are resistant to 1 drug in the pair [9] and are thought to slow the evolution of resistance [10,11], they have generated considerable interest as a promising way to overcome antimicrobial drug resistance.\n\nDelays in the commencement of treatment of severe infections can dramatically increase mortality rates—for example, septic patients face an 8% increase in mortality for each hour’s delay [12]. Therefore, combinations of antimicrobials are commonly used prior to the identification of the causal organism. Most of the combinations currently employed are additive, but meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate better outcomes if synergistic combinations are used when the causal organism is unknown [12–15]. Molecules in additive combinations also frequently act against the same target or target pathways [16] and thus are potentially more susceptible to resistance-conferring mutation than combinations with different targets. However, few synergistic combinations have been identified [17] (S1 Table), and high-throughput identification has been challenging due to the numbers involved: a collection of 1,000 molecules has 1 million potential pairwise combinations.\n\nWe previously described a new approach to high-throughput identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs: the overlap2 method (O2M) [18]. O2M uses at least 1 known synergistic interaction to predict many additional interactions from large-scale chemical-genetics data. The rationale was that each small molecule in a synergistic pair produces a set of phenotypes—chemical-genetic signature—in a precise set of mutants that show reduced or enhanced growth in the presence of each molecule. When mutants exhibit the same phenotype when treated with known synergistic molecules, we predict that any molecule that induces the same phenotype from the same mutant will act synergistically with each original synergistic molecule. This was indeed the case, even when the known synergistic molecules have different mechanisms of action [18]. When we validated O2M on the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, we identified 36 new synergistic interactions with a low false positive rate (73% of the predictions were verified) [18]. Since then, several other groups published methods using chemical-genetics datasets to identify synergistic small-molecule interactions [19–21]. Chemical-genetics datasets are widely available for a variety of pathogenic microbes, including Plasmodium falciparum [22,23], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24], Candida albicans [25,26], Candida glabrata [27], and C. neoformans [18]. Thus, methods identifying synergistic drug interactions from chemical-genetics datasets are potentially broadly applicable.\n\nIn this study, we show that O2M is also applicable to bacterial pathogens and antibiotics. Furthermore, we expand its utility with a novel high-throughput screening method for synergistic combinations and elucidate the molecular mechanism of a new drug combination. From this, we go on to rationally design synergistic combinations with different targets but the same phenotypic consequences, thus bypassing the original resistance mechanism. Indeed, our rationally designed synergistic combinations efficiently inhibit growth of clinical isolates resistant to the original antibiotic combination. In sum, we have developed an adaptable method for high-throughput screening for synergistic small-molecule pairs that facilitates rational design of synergistic small-molecule combinations, thereby addressing a key medical need in the treatment of drug-resistant infections.\n\nResults\n\nO2M uses a chemical-genetics dataset to identify synergistic small-molecule pairs active against E. coli\n\nWe first demonstrate that our method for predicting synergistic interactions between small molecules, O2M, can be successfully applied to organisms from different kingdoms. We initially developed O2M for the fungal pathogen C. neoformans, but here we apply O2M to E. coli [28] with comparable success. In this section, we describe the initial analysis of the published E. coli chemical-genetics dataset [28]. In the next section, we show how information from analysis of this dataset allows high-throughput screening for synergistic molecule pairs.\n\nO2M requires a chemical-genetics dataset, generated when a library of knockout mutants is grown in the presence of &gt;100 different chemicals. A quantitative growth score is calculated for each mutant/small-molecule combination. Growth scores can indicate either slower growth (negative values) or faster growth (positive values) compared to wild-type growth scores. The growth scores of all mutants when treated with each small molecule is that small molecule’s “chemical-genetic signature.”\n\nO2M is based on the rationale that similarities between chemical-genetic signatures of a known synergistic pair contains information that is somehow indicative of synergy—and thus can be used to identify additional synergistic interactions (Fig 1A and [18]). When we compare the chemical-genetic signatures of a pair of small molecules already known to act synergistically, we identified a subset of mutants with similar growth scores. We term this subset of mutants “putative synergy prediction mutants.” We hypothesized that any molecule that elicited the same phenotypes in the same mutants as the known synergistic molecules would also act synergistically with each member of the known synergistic pair.\n\nWe analyzed chemical-genetic signatures for the known synergistic antibiotic pair trimethoprim and sulfamethizole from the Nichols et al. E. coli chemical-genetics dataset [28]. This resource contains quantitative growth scores for over 4,000 E. coli knockout mutants grown under approximately 300 different conditions (including different types of media and lysogeny broth [LB] medium containing small molecules). We looked for genes whose knockout mutants exhibit a significant (|Z| &gt; 2.5) growth score to both trimethoprim and sulfamethizole (Fig 1B). Genes that are transcribed as a single unit (according to EcoliWiki: http://ecoliwiki.net/colipedia/index.php/Welcome_to_EcoliWiki) were binned together. We identified 4 elements common to both chemical-genetic signatures: ECK0963-68, ECK1082-86, ECK1710-13, ECK1864-66, and ECK3930. Knockouts of these gene(s) are putative synergy prediction mutants.\n\nWe then calculated if each putative synergy prediction mutant successfully identified trimethoprim synergizers. Again, using the Nichols et al. dataset [28], we identified all small molecules that elicit a significant score (|Z| &gt; 2.5) from the 4 putative synergy prediction mutants. We also generated a list of negative control molecules that did not elicit a phenotype from any mutant in any response pattern gene. We performed checkerboard assays, a standard measure of synergistic interactions [29], for each predicted synergizer or negative control combined with trimethoprim or sulfamethizole. All small molecules and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are listed in Table 1.\n\nA synergistic interaction is defined as at least a 4-fold decrease in the MIC of each drug in the pair, producing a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of ≤0.5 [30]. We found that small molecules that inhibit growth of putative synergy prediction mutant eck1864-66Δ operon are enriched for synergistic interactions with both trimethoprim (p &lt; 0.03, Fisher’s exact test) and sulfamethizole (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) relative to a randomly generated negative control small-molecule set (Fig 1C &amp; 1D). For example, 25% of predicted synergizers acted synergistically with trimethoprim, compared to 4% of the negative control set. None of the other synergistic response pattern operons identified synergistic interactions with trimethoprim or sulfamethizole at a higher rate than chance (S1 Fig). In total, we identified 5 new synergistic interactions from analyzing the small molecules used in generation of the E. coli chemical-genetics dataset [28]. Azidothymidine (AZT) acted synergistically with both trimethoprim and sulfamethizole. Three molecules synergize only with trimethoprim and 1 only with sulfamethizole. Since trimethoprim interacted with more molecules, we prioritize it in subsequent experiments.\n\nThe genes in the ECK1864-66 operon are involved in DNA synthesis, modification, and repair, which might explain why this operon, and not our other putative synergy prediction mutants, predicted synergy with trimethoprim. ECK1864 encodes an endonuclease that resolves Holliday junctions [31,32]. ECK1865 gene product does not have a known molecular function, but the mutant is sensitive to ionizing radiation [33]. ECK1866 encodes dihydroneopterin triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, an enzyme involved in the early stages of folate biosynthesis [34]. In contrast, the other putative synergy prediction genes, whose mutants did not enrich for trimethoprim synergizers, encoded gene products that did not function in pathways related to DNA synthesis, repair, or folate biosynthesis [35,36].\n\nNotably, these experiments identified new synergistic partners for trimethoprim and sulfamethizole that are not currently used as antibiotics but are approved for human use in other indications. The antiviral drug AZT is promising because of its potent interaction with both trimethoprim and sulfamethizole. AZT has previously reported antibacterial activity but has not been shown to have any synergistic interactions with antibiotics [37–39]. AZT and several other newly identified synergizers are DNA-damaging agents, thereby suggesting a significantly different mechanism of action than the trimethoprim + sulfamethizole combination.\n\nIn addition, we performed a similar analysis on vancomycin, which acts synergistically with cephalosporins [40,41]. When we tested the cephalosporins used in the Nichols et al. dataset with vancomycin for synergistic interactions, cefaclor acted synergistically with vancomycin in a checkerboard assay (S2 Fig). We found only 1 gene/operon, ECK3247-48, with a mutant that exhibited a significant growth score (|Z| &gt; 2.5) when grown in the presence of vancomycin and cefaclor. We then identified all small molecules from the Nichols et al. dataset [28] that induced a significant phenotype (|Z| &gt; 2.5) from eck3247Δ or eck3248Δ cells, predicting that these molecules would synergize with vancomycin. When we tested these in checkerboard assays for synergy (S2 Fig), we identified 3 molecules that synergized with vancomycin: chelators EDTA and EGTA and aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin. Ion availability is known to effect pathogenicity [42] and vancomycin efficacy [43], but we cannot find previous reports of an interaction between vancomycin and novobiocin, which inhibits DNA gyrase activity [44]. These data demonstrate that O2M identifies synergistic interactions for multiple antibiotics.\n\nSynergy prediction mutants for trimethoprim allow easy, high-throughput screening for synergistic drug interactions\n\nWe exploited our newly identified synergy prediction mutant (eck1864-66Δ) to perform one of the first high-throughput screens for synergistic pairs (Fig 2A). Our rationale was that because synergy prediction mutants exhibited the same phenotypic response to molecules known to act synergistically, this limited set of knockout mutants could be used to rapidly screen additional small molecules to identify those that are likely to be synergistic with the starting molecule.\n\nOur assay is extremely simple and identifies synergistic pairs without performing multidrug assays. Instead, synergy prediction mutants functionally substitute for 1 of the antibiotics. We screened the Microsource Spectrum Collection, a small-molecule library of 2,000 compounds that is enriched for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. We grew wild-type and eck1864-66Δ mutant cells in the presence of each small molecule, then identified small molecules that inhibit growth of the synergy response marker strain but not wild-type cells after 18 hours of growth (Z score &lt; −2.5). We identified 28 of these putative trimethoprim-synergizing molecules (Table 2).\n\nWe verified the synergistic interactions between trimethoprim and our screen hits using 2 different methods: checkerboard assays and Bliss Independence. Checkerboards are preferable but require that both small molecules inhibit microbial growth on their own. Of the 18 screen hits that met this criterion, 8 were verified to act synergistically with trimethoprim (Fig 2B). This 44% enrichment rate is significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater than the 4% frequency of trimethoprim synergizers in a randomly selected set of small molecules (Fig 1). Six of these small molecules (phthalylsulfacetamide, phthalysulfathiazole, sulfabenzamide, sulfacetamide, sulfaphenazole, and sulfapyridine) are sulfonamide antibiotics that inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase, the same target as sulfamethizole. A seventh, dapsone, also inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase but belongs to a different class of drugs [45]. The final verified screen hit, mitoxanthrone, is an antineoplastic DNA-intercalating agent [46] and not a sulfonamide antibiotic.\n\nThe remaining 10 screen hits do not inhibit E. coli growth on their own, so we attempted to verify their synergistic action using the Bliss independence model [30]. Briefly, in a 96-well plate containing growth medium and bacteria, we created a gradient of trimethoprim, then added each small molecule of interest at both 10 μM and 100 μM concentrations. Synergistic small molecules enhance growth inhibition by trimethoprim at both concentrations versus trimethoprim alone. We found that 2 of 10 small molecules exhibit synergy at both concentrations (Fig 2C). Sulfanitran is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Cyclosporine is a cyclic peptide that inhibits calcineurin [47] but is not known to have a bacterial target.\n\nThe new synergistic molecules found from O2M analysis and the high-throughput screen fall into 2 main groups. First, the sulfonamide antibiotics almost certainly act by the same mechanism as trimethoprim + sulfamethizole, so strains resistant to the combination would likely also be resistant to these new pairs. The second group consists of several DNA damaging agents (AZT, mitomycin C, mitaxanthrone). This result suggests a second molecular mechanism underlying synergy. Therefore, we focus on this second group in subsequent experiments.\n\nSynergistic drug pairs are active against multidrug-resistant clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates\n\nOur most promising new synergistic interaction is between trimethoprim or sulfamethizole and AZT. The first anti-HIV drug [48], AZT, was investigated as a chemotherapeutic before the discovery of its antiretroviral activity [49]. AZT’s MIC against multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli and K. pneumoniae is in the nanogram per milliliter range (Table 3), suggesting that it could be a powerful antibiotic. AZT causes premature chain termination during bacterial DNA replication [38,39,50], induces the SOS response [38,39], and moderately increases mutation rates [51].\n\nWe tested whether AZT acts synergistically with trimethoprim in 12 MDR clinical isolates of E. coli and 5 MDR K. pneumoniae isolates. Seven of the E. coli isolates and 4 K. pneumoniae isolates are resistant to the trimethoprim/sulfamethizole combination. In the vast majority of trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates, the classic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethizole no longer acted synergistically (FICI ≤ 0.5) (Fig 3A). One possible reason behind this is that trimethoprim and sulfamethiole targets are in the same pathway [52], so resistance to 1 drug could confer some resistance to the other and block the synergistic interaction. In contrast, trimethoprim and AZT acted synergistically against 5 E. coli and 2 K. pneumoniae trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates. Our new synergistic pair thus acts against multiple species of trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe synergistic interaction between trimethoprim and AZT activates a stress pathway that the single agent drugs do not\n\nThe mechanisms underlying synergistic interactions are poorly explored, with the exception of trimethoprim + sulfamethizole (or other sulfamonamides). Both molecules are inhibitors of folate biosynthesis, so these drugs were historically thought to synergize due to simultaneous inhibition of 2 enzymes in the folate biosynthesis pathway [52]. The Nichols et al. chemical-genetic analysis suggests that trimethoprim and sulfonamides differentially impact the steps between tetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate production (Fig 1B) [28]. Regardless, since DNA-damaging agents such as AZT do not inhibit folate biosynthesis, they likely act through a second mechanism of synergy.\n\nAZT alone induces the SOS response [38,39], so we hypothesized that the synergistic pairing with trimethoprim could amplify each molecule’s individual activity. We performed checkerboard assays on K12 E. coli carrying a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid under control of the SOS-induced sulA promoter. We selected the sulA promoter because it is induced late in the SOS response, indicating a robust SOS response and cell growth arrest [53].\n\nNeither trimethoprim nor sulfamethizole alone induces the sulA reporter compared to a no-drug control (Fig 4A). AZT alone induced the sulA promoter modestly but reproducibly (1.6-fold relative to the control). These results predict that the combination of AZT and trimethoprim would show a 3-fold induction. Instead, we see a 9-fold induction (p &lt; 0.01; Mann-Whitney test). We observed the same trend for mitomycin C, a DNA crosslinking agent [54] that also synergizes with trimethoprim (Fig 1).\n\nWe also tested 2 additional molecules as controls. The RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampicin, which blocks the SOS response [55] and does not synergize with trimethoprim (Fig 2), exhibited a lower SOS response in combination with trimethoprim than alone (p &lt; 0.005; Mann-Whitney test). Similarly, the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea (HU) [56], which does not synergize with trimethoprim (Fig 2), also does not induce the sulA promoter alone or in combination with trimethoprim.\n\nSince the SOS response induces error-prone DNA repair, we hypothesized that the combination of trimethoprim and AZT increases mutation burden beyond that caused by each small molecule alone. To test this hypothesis, we performed a fluctuation assay to measure the mutation rate [57]. We grew cells in subinhibitory concentrations of each small molecule alone or in combination, then plated cells to LB + 15 μg/ml nalidixic acid, which selects for mutations in the topoisomerase gene [58,59]. We calculated mutation rate from the number of resistant colonies within the total population [60].\n\nThe trimethoprim synergizers AZT and mitomycin C both increase mutation rate by at least 3-fold in combination with trimethoprim but not alone, even at the subinhibitory concentrations tested (1/8 of MIC) (Fig 4B). Sulfamethizole alone or in combination with trimethoprim does not increase mutation rates. These data suggest that the amplification of DNA damage is an important step in the synergistic interaction between trimethoprim and AZT (or mitomycin C), while trimethoprim and sulfamethizole interact through a different mechanism.\n\nGenetic or chemical reduction of deoxynucleotide pools sensitizes E. coli cells to AZT\n\nOur data support the model that DNA damage accumulates in cells treated with trimethoprim + AZT. AZT’s connection to DNA damage is clear from its known mechanism of action [39]. However, trimethoprim’s connection is indirect. Folate is necessary for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidine [61], and methionine [62], and treatment with trimethoprim disrupts nucleotide homeostasis [61]. We hypothesized that such reduced nucleotide availability amplifies the phenotypic consequences of premature chain termination caused by AZT. Should the synergistic interaction between trimethoprim and AZT be due to the simultaneous inhibition of chain termination and depleted nucleotide pools, then we would expect additional, unrelated small molecules that cause similar effects to also interact synergistically. Furthermore, genetic mutations that deplete nucleotide pools would result in increased sensitivity to AZT, and other chain-terminating agents would cause increased sensitivity to trimethoprim.\n\nFirst, we tested the proposed nucleotide homeostasis/DNA chain termination interaction chemically. We performed a checkerboard assay with AZT and HU or floxuridine, 2 FDA-approved drugs that alter deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) balance [63]. Both HU and floxuridine acted synergistically with AZT but not trimethoprim (Fig 5A). We then tested trimethoprim in combination with nucleoside analogs other than AZT. As expected, nucleoside analogs that inhibit E. coli growth interact synergistically with trimethoprim but not AZT (Fig 5B).\n\nSecond, this interaction between nucleotide pools and AZT also occurs genetically. The E. coli gene deoxycytidine deaminase (dcd) encodes deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) deaminase [64]. dcd deletion mutants exhibit depleted deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) pools and elevated dCTP pools when grown in minimal medium [64–66]. dcd deletion mutant cells exhibit a 32-fold increase in AZT sensitivity compared to wild-type cells but no change in trimethoprim or rifampicin sensitivity (Fig 5C). By contrast, mutants in nucleoside diphosphate kinase (ndk) [67] exhibit elevated dCTP and dTTP pools but lower deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) pools [66,68]. ndk deletion mutant cells exhibit a 4-fold decrease in AZT sensitivity (increased resistance) compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that adequate dTTP is necessary for surviving AZT exposure. Therefore, we conclude that simultaneous disruption of nucleotide homeostasis and DNA replication increase E. coli growth inhibition.\n\nWe next tested if DNA repair mutants in general are hypersensitive to AZT or if the hypersensitivity is specific to disrupted nucleotide homeostasis. We grew cells deficient in mismatch repair (mutL, mutS, or mutH deletion mutants) or nucleotide excision repair (uvrA, uvrB, or uvrC deletion mutants) in AZT, trimethoprim, and rifampicin and did not observe increased sensitivity to any of these (Fig 5C). Finally, to make sure that the interaction between AZT and trimethoprim was not due to methionine depletion, we tested a deletion mutant in the methionine synthase gene metH [62]. metH mutant cells exhibited wild-type levels sensitivities to AZT, trimethoprim, and rifampicin (Fig 5C). Therefore, we conclude that disruption of nucleotide homeostasis (by multiple possible mechanisms) hypersensitizes bacterial cells to DNA damage caused by AZT. By substituting HU or floxuridine for trimethoprim, we demonstrated that we can rationally design additional synergistic pairs once the molecular mechanism underlying an interaction is understood.\n\nSmall molecules that disrupt nucleotide homeostasis act synergistically with AZT against clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates\n\nFinally, we tested our new, rationally designed synergistic pairs against our collection of clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. Substituting either HU (Fig 6A) or floxuridine (Fig 6B) for trimethoprim, we found that either molecule combined with AZT inhibited growth of trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates. HU + AZT acted synergistically in 15 of 17 clinical isolates, including all but 1 of the trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates (n = 11). Floxuridine + AZT also acted synergistically in most clinical isolates (12 of 17), including all but 2 trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant isolates. The MICs of floxuridine and AZT are sub-μg/ml for most MDR clinical isolates, whereas MICs for trimethoprim or sulfamethizole were up to 5,000 μg/ml in vitro (Table 3). Rationally designed synergistic pairs therefore bypassed resistance in clinical isolates.\n\nThe new floxuridine-AZT combination shows markedly improved efficacy in a zebrafish infection model\n\nWe then tested the floxuridine + AZT combination in a zebrafish infection model. Efficacy of synergistic drug pairs has historically been difficult to evaluate in vertebrate systems, and many prior studies use the moth larvae Galleria mellonella or perform only in vitro tests [19,20,69,70]. Zebrafish offer several advantages: they have a mammalian-like innate immune system [71], a long history as microbial infection models [71–75], and are a good platform for assessing drug toxicity [76,77]. We injected approximately 2,500 colony-forming units (CFU) of trimethoprim-resistant E. coli into the pericardial cavity of zebrafish embryos [75,78], incubated for 3 hours, then treated with either the original drug combination (trimethoprim + sulfamethizole) or our rationally designed combination (floxuridine + AZT). We analyzed bacterial burden at 24 hours postinoculation (hpi) at dosages analogous to human dosage (see Materials and methods and Table 4) [79,80]. The new combination was indeed successful—it resulted in a 10,000-fold reduction in median bacterial burden in infected zebrafish embryos treated with floxuridine + AZT compared to infected embryos treated with trimethoprim + sulfamethizole (Fig 7A). When we infected embryos with a trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-sensitive E. coli strain, floxuridine + AZT treatment and trimethoprim + sulfamethizole treatment were equally effective. (Fig 7B).\n\nWe also analyzed MICs in the presence of human serum, as a substantial increase in MIC in the presence of serum would indicate that our small molecules of interest are binding to serum proteins and are not bioavailable [81]. We tested MICs of floxuridine, AZT, trimethoprim, and sulfamethizole with and without 20% human serum and found only minor changes in MIC (S14 Table). The dosages we use in zebrafish are well under the human dosage (Table 4), suggesting that it would be possible to obtain the necessary drug concentrations in humans.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHigh-throughput identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs\n\nSynergistic small molecules are of considerable clinical interest, but systematic identification has been challenging. This study describes 4 significant advances to such systematic identification. First, we demonstrate that O2M is generally applicable beyond the fungal pathogen for which it was originally developed [18]. Second, we and others show that previously published chemical-genetic datasets [18,22–26,28,82] can be successfully used as the raw input for O2M, significantly decreasing the upfront investment required. Third, O2M identifies knockout mutants that can be used as readouts for synergy in highly scalable screening assays for additional synergistic combinations. Finally, understanding the mechanisms that underlie synergistic interactions can facilitate the rational design of further synergistic combinations that bypass antibiotic resistance.\n\nOur results show that a wide variety of synergistic combinations are available if we know how to search for them. We would suggest that these discoveries represent a small fraction of the potential synergistic combinations. In support of this idea, several groups recently published analysis methods that, like our original O2M analysis [18], use chemical-genetics data to predict synergy between antibiotics [19] or antifungals [20,21,70]. Notably, each method identifies different, complementary synergistic pairs, suggesting that current methods are far from identifying all synergistic interactions.\n\nAs described here, the particular advantage of O2M is its scalability to screen for synergistic small molecules that are not commonly used as antibiotics. This scalability is critical to keeping the initial screens as broad as possible—since substituting 1 member of a synergistic pair for a second member can change the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction, identification of diverse synergistic pairs offers the greatest potential for further rational design. We screened a well-studied collection of FDA-approved small molecules, identifying 14 novel synergistic combinations with the widely used antibiotic trimethoprim. O2M is also much faster than a pairwise screen of a small-molecule library. By identifying synergy prediction mutants, we can screen 2,000 molecules and verify only those predicted to be synergistic. The 28 predicted synergistic molecules identified in our trimethoprim/sulfamethizole screen took less than a week to validate. Testing of the entire 2,000 small-molecule collection in combination with a single molecule would take months.\n\nMechanisms underlying synergistic small-molecule interactions\n\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying synergistic drug interactions are generally poorly understood [4,28]. There are 3 main hypotheses for why any given pair of small molecules exhibit synergistic interaction: that the pairs (1) act together to cause a third, novel inhibitory activity (“gain-of-function” hypothesis), (2) act in combination by simultaneously inhibiting 2 different functions to increase potency (“two-hit” or “parallel pathway” hypothesis) [83], or (3) 1 drug increases the activity and/or bioavailability of the other (“bioavailability” hypothesis) [84]. Our data demonstrate that the trimethoprim and AZT interaction likely represent a “two-hit” mechanism, acting through the combined induction of DNA damage and blocking DNA repair by disrupting nucleotide homeostasis (Fig 8). This molecular mechanism quite likely differs from that historically thought to underlie the trimethoprim/sulfonamides [52]. Recent data suggest that the trimethoprim + sulfamethizole interaction is not as simple as simultaneous inhibition of 2 folate biosynthesis enzymes [52]. Instead, the hypothesis is that trimethoprim and sulfonamides result in buildup of different secondary metabolites, which differentially impact enzyme activities [28]. However, since the phenotypic consequences of treatment with trimethoprim + sulfamethizole differ from treatment with trimethoprim + AZT, the mechanisms are likely also different. We surmise that both combinations represent “two-hit” synergistic interactions. “Two-hit” synergistic interactions can be predicted from network analysis: genes/pathways whose knockouts exhibit synthetic lethality could be good targets of drug combinations. These analyses also demonstrate the importance of network analysis and high-throughput studies on model organisms [85]: the chemical-genomic dataset we used for our initial O2M analysis was from a nonpathogenic K12 genetic background [28], showing that K12 data are sufficient to elucidate synergistic drug mechanisms.\n\nOne potential concern about using trimethoprim + AZT or floxuridine + AZT clinically is that these combinations increase mutation rate. While this is indeed a concern, many antibiotics target DNA replication and other processes that also increase mutation rates. Our measured mutation rate for trimethoprim + AZT, approximately 2 x 10−8 mutations per cell, is well within the range of other antibiotics [86]. These vary from 10−9 mutations per cell (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) [86] to 10−6 mutations per cell [87]. Mutation rates will vary with species and strain [87,88], but trimethoprim + AZT induces mutation rates comparable to those induced by ciprofloxacin [86].\n\nTowards rational design of synergistic combination therapy\n\nOnce we identify biological pathways and processes whose simultaneous inhibition blocks microbial growth, we can then rationally design synergistic drug treatments that bypass antibiotic resistance. Here, we present a proof-of-principle methodology that demonstrates the power of this rational design. Once we identified the molecular mechanism underlying the trimethoprim + AZT interaction, we substituted trimethoprim for another FDA-approved small molecule. This newly designed combination, floxuridine + AZT, achieved the same synergistic interaction with AZT yet bypassed trimethoprim resistance in MDR clinical isolates (Figs 6 and 7). Indeed, floxuridine + AZT was far superior to trimethoprim + sulfamethizole in a vertebrate infection model with trimethoprim/sulfamethizole-resistant E. coli. That is, we inhibited MDR E. coli infection with lower doses of structurally unrelated but functionally similar small molecules.\n\nThe optimal clinical application of interacting small molecules is currently under debate. Recent work suggested that sequential, rather than simultaneous, application of synergistic small molecules prevents the development of drug resistance [8,89]. Others suggest that antagonistic small-molecule interactions could be beneficial [8,83,90]. Antagonistic interactions occur when 2 molecules in combination decrease each other’s efficacy. One theory is that antagonism decreases the selective advantage of a drug-resistant mutation, and thus evolution of resistance is slower to an antagonistic pair than a synergistic pair [90]. These ideas merit further exploration in clinical and animal models of infection.\n\nIn sum, O2M is an important tool for high-throughput identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs and successfully identifies new treatments to combat MDR infections. With the growing antibiotic crisis, treatments that are effective against MDR bacteria need to move rapidly into the clinic. Our method of screening FDA-approved drugs identified candidate treatments that could be deployed with fewer regulatory trials than needed for new drugs. Moreover, our rationally designed treatment, floxuridine + AZT, also uses FDA-approved agents (and AZT is well tolerated for short-term treatments, despite toxicities associated with long-term use at high doses [91]). We hope to spur interest among clinicians to test such designed synergistic combinations against difficult-to-treat MDR infections, when appropriate.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement\n\nAnimals used in this study were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Utah IACUC committee (protocol 10–02014), which follow guidelines from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and zfin.org. Zebrafish older than 3 days postfertilization were euthanized by immersion in a chilled water bath followed by mechanical disruption. Zebrafish younger than 3 days, which do not have developed pain sensors, were euthanized by mechanical disruption. Infections took place under tricaine anesthesia.\n\nE. coli strains\n\nUnless otherwise stated, experiments were performed on E. coli K12 strain MG1655. E. coli blood isolates #1–8 (referred to as BEC1, BEC2, etc.) are described in Barber et al. [78]. Urinary tract infection (UTI) isolates and K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained from ARUP labs. Strains are listed in S15 Table.\n\nE. coli growth and small-molecule assays\n\nAll assays were performed in M9 minimal medium (10.5g/L M9 broth [Amresco], 0.2% casamino acids, 0.1M CaCl2, 0.4% glucose, 1M MgSO4, 0.25% nicotinic acid, 0.33% thiamine in H2O) unless otherwise stated. To determine MICs, an M9 culture of MG1655 was growth overnight at 37°C with shaking, then diluted to OD600 = 0.002. We then inoculated each well with approximately 1,000 cells (2 μl of culture into 200 μl of medium per well). Plates were incubated at 37°C unless otherwise stated. Small-molecule gradients were diluted in 2-fold dilution series unless otherwise stated. MIC values (Table 1) are calculated following 24 hours incubation at 37°C. MIC values are calculated as &gt;90% growth inhibition unless otherwise stated. MIC values for MDR strains, which grow more rapidly than lab strains, were calculated following 24 hours incubation at 37°C. When calculating MICs in the presence of human serum, we used standard techniques but substituted up to 20% of the media volume with human serum (Sigma).\n\nO2M analysis\n\nWe performed O2M analysis as previously described [18] with the following variations. (Step-by-step instructions are available in the S1 Text section). The Nichols et al. paper calculates a growth score for each mutant + small molecule combination [28]. We then use these growth scores to calculate significance in O2M analysis. We considered any growth score significant if either: (1) growth score for mutant A and small molecule B ≥ average growth score for all mutants when grown on plates containing small molecule B + 2.5*standard deviation of all small molecule B growth scores, or (2) growth score for mutant A and small molecule B ≤ average growth score for all mutants when grown on plates containing small molecule B − 2.5*standard deviation of all small molecule B growth scores.\n\nThis corresponds to a Z-score cutoff value of +/−2.5. We identified any gene whose knockout exhibited a significant score when exposed to trimethoprim or sulfamethizole in the Nichols et al. dataset [28]. We then identified genes whose knockouts responded significantly across the majority of concentrations of both drugs. If these genes are transcribed as part of a polycistronic RNA, then a phenotype was considered significant if any mutant in that operon met the Z score requirement (|Z| &gt; 2.5). For example, if eck1864Δ was significant at 1 trimethoprim concentration and eck1865Δ at another, the entire ECK1864-66 operon was considered a significant hit at both those concentrations. For trimethoprim + sulfamethizole, this method identified 5 potential synergy prediction mutants/operons. We tested all small molecules predicted as synergistic for each of these synergy prediction mutants/operons, then calculated enrichment for successful predictions using a Fisher’s exact test. We also tested additional Z scores, |Z| &gt; 1.96 and |Z| &gt; 3.0, with no change in end result. |Z| &gt; 3.0 identified ECK1864-66, ECK0964, and ECK1710-13 as putative synergy prediction mutants. As shown in Figs 1 and S1, only ECK1864-66 enriched for small molecules that synergize with trimethoprim. At |Z| &gt; 1.96, ECK4132-33, ECK1189, and ECK2901-04 were also identified as putative synergy prediction mutants. None of these mutants enriched for synergistic interactions with trimethoprim (S5 Fig).\n\nFICI calculations\n\nWe followed the same method as Hsieh et al. [92] with minor modifications. For MG1655, starting inoculation was 2 μl of an OD600 = 0.02 or 0.002 (10,000 or 1,000 cells per well of 200 μl medium, respectively). Any synergistic interaction was verified at both inoculation levels but the initial MG1655 screen using 10,000 cells per well. FICI assays for the MG1655 strain were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. FICI assays of clinical strains were incubated for 12 hours at 37°C using an inoculum of 1,000 cells. OD600 was read on a BioTek plate reader model Synergy H1. Growth inhibition ≥90% compared to the no-drug control was considered significant.\n\nE. coli mutant construction\n\nE. coli mutant eck1864-66::kanR was made in MG1655 by deleting the candidate gene or operon using the 1-step gene deletion method [93]. The putative knockout clones were confirmed by verification PCR with primers outside the deletion region. We amplified the eck1864-66 knockout cassette with the following primers (gene-specific region in bold, kanamycin-specific region in regular typeface):\n\neck1866KO F:\n\nGTGAAGGATAAAGTGTATAAGCGTCCCGTTTCGATCTTAGTGGTCATCTATGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG\n\neck1864KO R:\n\nTTAACGCAGTCGCCCTCTCGCCAGGTTCAGCCGCGATTCGCTCATCTGCATCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG\n\nColonies were selected on kanamycin. The clones were colony purified before PCR confirmation, then verified by PCR with the following primers:\n\nECK1864Ver F- CGACTCTCTGATGAGGCCTG\n\nECK1866Ver R-CCATTTACTATGACCTGCCA\n\nMicrosource Spectrum library screen for trimethoprim’s synergistic partners\n\nWe inoculated either MG1655 wild-type or eck1864-66Δ cells at 1,000 cells per well (200 μl volume), then added either a vehicle control (DMSO) or small molecule to a final concentration of 10 μM per well. Plates were incubated for 18 hours at 37°C, then OD600 was measured on a plate reader. Small molecules that inhibited growth by more than 2.5-fold of the standard deviation of growth within each plate were considered significant.\n\nSOS pathway response assays\n\nThe plasmid with either GFP expressed under control of the sulA promoter or a promoterless plasmid containing only the GFP gene was transformed into MG1655 [94]. Strains were then grown to mid-log in MG1655 (OD600 approximately 0.4), then subcultured to OD600 to inoculate the experiment (2 ul into 200 μl M9 medium per well). We then performed a standard checkerboard assay, reading GFP signal (485 nm excitation and 528 nm emission) and OD600 at 0, 6, and 24 hours. The 24-hour timepoint determined the MIC90 and the difference between the 0- and 6-hour GFP signals determined the promoter activation.\n\nBliss independence model of synergy\n\nIf a small molecule hit from the Microsource Spectrum library screen did not inhibit E. coli growth alone, we evaluated its synergistic interaction with trimethoprim by Bliss Independence [30] instead of checkerboard analysis. Briefly, we created a gradient of trimethoprim from 4 to 62.5 μg/ml, then added small molecules of interest at 10 μM or 100 μM. We calculated percent growth, then determined Bliss Independence by determining whether the growth inhibition caused by each small molecule alone is equal to the inhibition caused by combination treatment. If inhibition is greater in the combination, then the molecules act synergistically.\n\nGrowth of E. coli mutants on trimethoprim, AZT, and rifampicin\n\nStrains (S15 Table) were grown in M9 overnight, then diluted to an OD66 of 0.002 and inoculated into 96-well plates at the same density used for MIC and FICI assays. Each 96-well plate contained a gradient of either AZT, trimethoprim, or rifampicin, serially diluted in 2-fold increments. After 24 hours at 37°C, plates were measured in a BioTek Synergy H1. Each well was then normalized to the no-drug control for each mutant. Percent growth relative to this control is shown in the heat map. Each assay was repeated 3 times and the data averaged.\n\nZebrafish (Danio rerio) husbandry\n\nAll zebrafish husbandry and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the University of Utah and IACUC-approved protocols. Wildtype AB* zebrafish were maintained as breeding colonies on a 14-hour/10-hour light/dark cycle. Embryos were collected as mixed egg clutches and raised at 28.5°C in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.27 mM KCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.16 mM MgSO4; pH 7.4) containing 0.000016% methylene blue as an antifungal agent.\n\nInfection of zebrafish embryos\n\nEmbryos were anesthetized at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) with tricaine (0.77 mM ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt [Sigma-Aldrich]), embedded in 0.8% low-melt agarose without tricaine, and supplemented with E3 media lacking methylene blue. A bacteria culture of BEC8 or F11 was grown at 37°C overnight in 12 ml M9 minimal media. Prior to injection, 1 mL of culture at OD600 = 2.5 to 3.5 for BEC8 or OD600 = 1.7 was created. Filtered green food dye was added to the culture in a 1:10 dilution. 1 nL was injected into the pericardial cavity of embryos using an Olympus SZ61 stereomicroscope together with a YOU-1 micromanipulator (Narishige), a Narishige IM-200 microinjector, and a JUN-AIR model 3-compressor. Embryos were left to incubate at 28.5°C for 3 hours. Small molecules were mixed with green food dye, and 1 nL was injected into the yolk of embryos at 3 hpi. Dosages are listed in Table 4. (We estimated embryo mass based on Stehr et al. [95]). Additionally, drugs were supplemented to water 12 hours after yolk injections (15 hpi). Any embryos that were physically damaged during the procedures were discarded and excluded from further analysis. Embryos were unembedded and placed individually in a 96-well plate and left to incubate in 0.03% Instant Ocean at 28.5°C until we determined bacterial burden at 24 hpi for BEC8 or 19 hpi for F11. These timepoints result in comparable bacterial burden in the vehicle-treated embryos. Bacterial inoculation levels are shown in S4 Fig.\n\nEnumeration of bacterial numbers in zebrafish embryos\n\nEmbryos were euthanized at 24 (BEC8) or 19 (F11) hpi, then homogenized in 500 μL of PBS using a mechanical PRO 250 homogenizer (PRO Scientific). Homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates (F11) or LB agar plates containing ampicillin (BEC8) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Any embryos dead and decaying by the euthanasia timepoint were excluded from further analysis, as survival curves show that dead embryos were rare at these timepoints [78] and were evenly distributed across treatment groups.\n\nSupporting information"
