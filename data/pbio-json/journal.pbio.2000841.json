  "abstract": "Fundamental to biological decision-making is the ability to generate bimodal expression patterns where 2 alternate expression states simultaneously exist. Here, we use a combination of single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling to examine the sources of bimodality in the transcriptional program controlling HIV’s fate decision between active replication and viral latency. We find that the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein manipulates the intrinsic toggling of HIV’s promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR), to generate bimodal ON-OFF expression and that transcriptional positive feedback from Tat shifts and expands the regime of LTR bimodality. This result holds for both minimal synthetic viral circuits and full-length virus. Strikingly, computational analysis indicates that the Tat circuit’s noncooperative “nonlatching” feedback architecture is optimized to slow the promoter’s toggling and generate bimodality by stochastic extinction of Tat. In contrast to the standard Poisson model, theory and experiment show that nonlatching positive feedback substantially dampens the inverse noise-mean relationship to maintain stochastic bimodality despite increasing mean expression levels. Given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression appears consistent with the hypothesis that HIV’s decision between active replication and latency provides a viral fitness advantage. More broadly, the results suggest that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved not only for signal amplification but also for robustly generating bimodality by decoupling expression fluctuations (noise) from mean expression levels.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nBimodality is a recurring feature in many biological fate-selection programs [1], such as the HIV active-versus-latent decision (Fig 1A). Bimodal expression is a population-wide distribution pattern comprises 2 gene-expression modes, each corresponding to a specific fate path [2]. The mechanisms that can generate bimodal phenotypes have long been studied, and the architecture of underlying gene-regulatory circuits appears to be a key driver of bimodality [3–11]. Classically, bimodality has been associated with deterministic bistability in gene circuits [12–15]. Deterministic bistability requires ultrasensitive input-output relations and can result from nonlinear positive feedback (i.e., Hill coefficient &gt; 1) on a constitutively expressed promoter [16,17]. However, many promoters are nonconstitutive and instead toggle between inactive and active expression states, generating episodic bursts of mRNA production (for review, see [18]). The finding that promoters undergo episodic bursts of expression led to a proposal that this toggling alone could generate bimodality without deterministic bistability. Unlike constitutive expression, toggling increases the degrees of freedom in a system [19], and if promoter toggling occurs relatively slowly, the resulting expression bursts can potentially produce bimodality independent of ultrasensitivity [19,20]. However, the promoter toggling kinetics required to generate bimodality appeared to be in a small portion of the experimentally observed regime [18,21–23], with experimental measures of intrinsic promoter toggling exhibiting kinetics that are typically too fast to produce bimodal expression patterns (Fig 1B)—specifically, the measured promoter toggling rates were greater than the per capita protein and mRNA decay rates [18,24,25]. Nevertheless, synthetic positive-feedback circuits that slowed toggling could induce bimodality [26]. Thus, while computational models showed that promoter ON-OFF toggling was sufficient for bimodal expression [20] and synthetic transcriptional circuits lacking bistable feedback could generate bimodal expression [26], it remained unclear how natural biological circuits exploit this mechanism to generate bimodality without bistability. Here, we determine if promoter toggling can intrinsically generate bimodal distributions in a natural biological system (i.e., HIV) and the potential physiological relevance.\n\nWe focus on HIV as a physiological model system for expression bimodality driving a decision-making process (Fig 1A). Upon infection of a CD4+ T lymphocyte, HIV undergoes a fate-selection decision, either actively replicating to produce viral progeny and destroy the host cell or entering a long-lived quiescent state called proviral latency [28,29]. A viral gene-regulatory circuit is both necessary and sufficient to drive HIV fate selection [10]. At the core of this decision-making circuit is a virally encoded transcriptional positive-feedback loop comprises a single HIV protein—the transactivator of transcription (Tat)—that amplifies expression from the virus’s only promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Molecularly, this positive-feedback loop functions because the LTR is a relatively weak promoter, in the absence of Tat, with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation stalling approximately 69 nucleotides after initiation [30]. Tat transactivates the LTR by binding to a short, approximately 69-nucleotide-long RNA-hairpin loop called the Tat-activation RNA (TAR) loop and recruiting the positive transcriptional elongation factor b (pTEFb)—principally composed of CDK9 and cyclinT1—which hyperphosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, thereby relieving the RNAPII elongation block [30,31]. Thus, Tat acts much like a bacterial antiterminator enhancing transcriptional elongation rather than initiation.\n\nImportantly, minimal LTR-Tat positive-feedback circuits are sufficient to generate bimodal expression patterns [32], and in the full-length viral context, this circuit is both necessary and sufficient to drive HIV’s active-versus-latent decision [27]. There are 2 specific quantitative features of the Tat-LTR feedback circuit that are curious, given its obligate role in viral fate selection. First, unlike many other positive-feedback circuits that control phenotypic decisions [33,34], the Tat positive-feedback loop is noncooperative (Hill coefficient ≈ 1) and not deterministically bistable [35]. Second, the LTR promoter itself displays large episodic expression bursts toggling between ON and OFF states at virtually all integration sites throughout the human genome [24,36,37], raising the possibility that the LTR itself may be sufficient to generate bimodal expression patterns independent of Tat feedback.\n\nIn this study, we construct minimal circuits to examine if the LTR itself is capable of generating bimodal expression patterns in the absence of Tat feedback and then computationally examine the precise role of Tat positive feedback in bimodality. The results indicate that the LTR is intrinsically capable of generating bimodal ON-OFF expression even in the absence of feedback but that Tat feedback shifts and expands the regime of LTR bimodality into physiological ranges by slowing LTR toggling. In fact, the architecture and parameters of the Tat circuit appear optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression. Given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuitry that appears optimized to slow promoter toggling and generate bimodality may be consistent with the hypothesis that the circuit has been selectively maintained and that bimodal expression (between active replication and latency) provides a viral fitness advantage [38].\n\nResults\n\nLTR promoter toggling is capable of generating bimodality in the absence of feedback\n\nPrevious studies demonstrated that Tat positive feedback can generate bimodal expression patterns from the HIV LTR [32]. However, given the large, episodic bursts of expression that characterize LTR activity [24,36,37], we set out to test if the LTR was capable of bimodal expression, even in the absence of feedback (i.e., whether feedback was dispensable for bimodality, possibly having an orthogonal function in HIV). Analysis of experimental and computational literature reports indicated that the regime for generating bimodality through promoter toggling alone fell outside the experimentally observed values of LTR toggling but that slightly slower LTR toggling transitions might generate bimodality without feedback (Fig 1 and S1 Fig).\n\nTo test this prediction that Tat feedback was dispensable for bimodality, HIV circuitry was refactored to split the Tat positive-feedback loop [27] into open-loop parts (Fig 2A). This minimal circuit system allows Tat concentrations to be modulated by doxycycline (Dox) and Tat protein stability to be tuned through Shield-1 addition [27]. As Tat is fused to Dendra, the Tat concentrations can be quantified, while LTR activity is simultaneously tracked in single cells. This open-loop doxycyline-inducible circuit was integrated into T cells by viral transduction, and cells were exposed to varying concentrations of activator (Dox) and Tat proteolysis inhibitor (Shield-1)—generating approximately 48 unique unimodal Tat inputs to the LTR (S2 and S3 Figs and S1–S23 Data). Expression profiles from the LTR are all unimodal in the absence of Tat (S2 Fig), in agreement with previous findings [32,36,37]. However, in striking contrast, the presence of Tat induces bimodality from the LTR despite the lack of cooperativity or feedback in this open-loop system (Fig 2B, S2 and S3 Figs and S1–S23 Data). In other words, despite a fixed, unimodal concentration of active Tat transactivator, bimodal LTR distributions can be generated, and single-cell time-lapse microscopy confirms that the activity of the LTR is dependent on Tat input (S4 Fig and S24 Data). From the known requirements for bimodality to arise from a toggling promoter (Fig 1), the data suggest that LTR toggling becomes sufficiently slow in the presence of Tat to produce bimodal expression patterns, even in the absence of positive feedback.\n\nIndependent of feedback or cooperativity, LTR promoter toggling is sufficient to control full-length HIV fate\n\nThe bimodality in the minimal open-loop system (Fig 2) represents the 2 fate paths of the virus—active replication and proviral latency [40]—and suggests that positive feedback may also be dispensable for controlling viral fate in full-length HIV. Importantly, results from a Tat-deficient full-length HIV virus [27], where Tat is introduced in trans (S5 Fig), confirm that Tat feedback is not required to select between alternate HIV fate paths. Thus, unlike other decision-making circuits [17,26], fate selection can occur independent of positive feedback or cooperativity in HIV.\n\nTat slows promoter toggling by inhibiting LTR ON-to-OFF transitions, leading to bimodality\n\nTo understand the molecular mechanisms enabling LTR bimodality in the absence of feedback, we used a validated computational model of HIV [27] and adapted it to an open-loop system where Tat would either modulate (1) burst frequency alone, kON modulation; (2) burst frequency and burst size, kOFF modulation; or (3) burst size alone by affecting transcriptional efficiency, α modulation (top of Fig 2C, S1–S3 Tables and S1 Data). To model Tat modulation of kOFF alone, a third promoter state, termed Tat-LTRON, was added such that it maintained the same transcriptional efficiency, α, as the LTRON state. Thus, the transactivated LTR promoter must first transition from Tat-LTRON to LTRON and only then can it transition from LTRON to LTROFF and fully turn off. This third promoter state, Tat-LTRON, is necessary to generate changes in burst sizes without altering transcriptional efficiency or toggling from the LTROFF to LTRON state. The model results are consistent with previous findings that bimodality is not induced through frequency modulation of the LTR (i.e., kON modulation) or increases in burst size through transcriptional efficiency, α [24,36,37]. However, the model shows that slowing toggling kinetics, or increasing the dwell time in the LTRON and LTRTatON states (i.e., kOFF modulation), is required for bimodality, and if Tat only affects a single parameter, kOFF modulation is necessary and sufficient (bottom of Fig 2C, S6 Fig and S1 Data).\n\nThe interpretation of these results is that, while natural LTR promoter toggling is too quick to generate large enough expression fluctuations for bimodality, Tat transactivation is able to slow the kinetics of toggling, expanding the bimodal regime (Fig 1). The slowing of toggling kinetics reinforces the findings that Tat stabilizes transient pulses of expression from LTR fluctuations [40], by effectively reducing kOFF. If Tat does stabilize pulses of expression to control gene-expression variability, then the prediction is that altering Tat-feedback strength would, similar to the open-loop system, control the shape of the gene-expression distribution and bimodality.\n\nPositive-feedback strength controls whether the expression distribution is unimodal or bimodal in HIV\n\nTo test the prediction that Tat-feedback strength shapes the expression distribution, we used a synthetic Tat circuit [27] where positive-feedback strength could be manipulated pharmacologically by the addition of a small-molecule, Shield-1, that stabilizes Tat proteolysis (Fig 3A). In this system, a subset of isoclonal cell populations carrying this synthetic circuit naturally generate bimodal distributions (Fig 3B and S25–S29 Data). These clonal differences are mainly due to the genomic location of HIV integration, which can dictate the transcriptional bursting parameters, and the effectiveness of Tat transactivation [24,36]. Though the differences in Tat transactivation potential are not clear, transcriptional parameters of the LTR in the absence of feedback vary due to promoter methylation status, nucleosome acetylation and methylation state, or gene-proximity dependencies [41]. When positive-feedback strength is increased, a significant fraction of the cells generate bimodal distributions and even convert from a unimodal (low peak) into a bimodal (low and high peak) distribution or from a bimodal (low and high peak) to a unimodal (high peak) distribution (Fig 3B, S7 Fig and S25–S30 Data).\n\nImportantly, simulations of Tat positive-feedback circuitry corroborate this phenomenon of bimodal expression at intermediate feedback strength if Tat acts by decelerating LTR toggling kinetics (Fig 3C and S26 Data), in agreement with simulations of the open-loop circuit (Fig 2). Thus, these simulations indicate that Tat-feedback strength likely alters the natural LTR toggling kinetics set by the local integration site [42] to control HIV bimodal-expression patterns. To test if Tat feedback in fact extends pulses of expression (i.e., effective kOFF reduction), HIV gene-expression was activated to a high-expression state, using tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and the circuit was then allowed to relax back to the unperturbed state under varying feedback strengths. TNFα enhances HIV expression by stimulating recruitment of a p50-RelA heterodimer to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) binding sites within the LTR [42]. The cells were exposed to TNFα for 24 hours and then allowed to relax back in the presence of strong or weak feedback (S8 Fig). The results show that increasing feedback strength, by dosing cells with increasing amounts of Shield-1, increases the transient in the expressive states, leading to slower transitions from ON to OFF states (S8 Fig and S31 Data), which corroborates previous findings [27,40]. Thus, relaxation to various baseline states is dictated by feedback acting on promoter toggling.\n\nOne simplifying assumption in the model is that Tat only modulates a single bursting parameter. To test how relaxing this assumption affects bimodal generation, new simulations in which Tat could modulate multiple bursting parameters were performed. The models allow Tat to alter both burst size and frequency through kON and kOFF, kON and α, or kOFF and α modulation (S9 Fig). Interestingly, the simulations show that any combination of parameters could yield bimodality (S9 Fig). In each scenario, Tat positive feedback yields nonexponentially distributed “OFF” times and slows toggling kinetics. This result is in agreement with the previous findings that slowing promoter toggling kinetics yields bimodal distributions (Figs 1–3 and S6 Fig).\n\nA few alternate explanations are possible for the observed bimodality. The first is that the bimodality may arise from deterministic cell-to-cell variability [43] where the transcriptional parameters vary between cells, leading to bimodality. However, these minimal circuits display a high level of ergodicity [24,40], suggesting the cell-to-cell variability in the transcriptional parameters is minimal. Second, HIV feedback may be bistable (i.e., exist in 1 of 2 stable states [high or low] [17]). Bimodality observed from bistable circuits results from fluctuations around latching feedback strengths (S11 Fig). Previous studies analyzing fluctuations in noise to measure feedback strength, cooperativity in feedback, or stability of the “ON” state found that HIV feedback lacks the canonical features of bistability [34,35,40]. Last of all, HIV feedback may latch, meaning small increases in Tat would be drastically amplified to saturable levels upon which the system would then latch in a high state. Note that the latching behavior can be present in deterministically monostable feedback [40]. To test this, here, we directly quantified the feedback strength—to test if the feedback-induced bimodality results from latching feedback—by use of the small-signal loop gain, a direct measure of feedback strength [40,44,45]. The small-signal loop gain was quantified by measuring changes in LTR expression associated with changing Tat stability (S11 Fig) or increasing Tat concentration (S12 Fig and S32 Data). First, we verified that green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence intensity was linearly correlated to GFP-protein abundance, as shown [32,46], by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of known concentrations of soluble GFP by microscopy and then comparing these values to the GFP fluorescence intensity of the LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat-FKBP circuit in 2 isoclonal populations when feedback was either inactive or active (S10 Fig and S33 and S34 Data). As expected, the GFP fluorescence intensity was well within the linear GFP-protein concentration regime for both microscopy and flow cytometry (S10 Fig and S33 and S34 Data). After verifying that fluorescence intensity scales linearly with protein abundance, we used fluorescence intensity to quantify changes in protein expression associated with altering Tat stability or Tat concentration. In agreement with other measures of HIV feedback strength [40], we find that Tat positive feedback appears to be nonlatching (S11 and S12 Figs and S32 Data). Interestingly, unlike systems that latch, nonlatching feedback strength inherently renders the system relatively insensitive to small fluctuations [47] (i.e., HIV will not drastically change expression profile or latch in response to a small fluctuation) lending a molecular explanation for the insensitivity of HIV circuitry to external cues [48,49].\n\nHIV Tat positive feedback appears optimized to robustly generate bimodal distributions\n\nThe combination of nonlatching feedback coupled to a toggling promoter allows for bimodal generation across a wide range of Tat concentrations (Fig 2) and feedback strengths (Fig 3). Promoters driving nonlatching feedback can exhibit extended, transient pulses of expression before reverting back to the initial system state [8]. To test if this mechanism of extended-duration transient pulses was responsible for generating bimodality in the LTR, we built a specific model of the LTR to map out the phase space of feedback strengths that would allow for LTR bimodality given the known toggling parameters (S1 Table). The model specifically considers promoter toggling coupled to weak positive feedback and examined the effect of changing feedback strength (from weak nonlatching to strong nonlatching). In agreement with previous theoretical predictions [19,20], intrinsic slow promoter toggling is sufficient to generate bimodality, but only in a very narrow parameter regime (Figs 1 and 4A).\n\nTo explore if weak nonlatching positive feedback might explain the robust generation of bimodality that was experimentally observed, we incorporated dose-response data from the open-loop circuit into the model and generated an input-output function (S13 Fig) to quantify the relationship between Tat and kOFF values. This approach allows the open-loop data to be mapped onto a model containing feedback (Fig 4A). The output of the resulting model shows a striking dependence of bimodality on feedback strength (Fig 4B and S31 Data). Specifically, as feedback strength increases from zero, the bimodality regime significantly expands. However, as feedback increases further, to strong nonlatching feedback strengths, there is a drastic reduction in the potential for bimodal generation (Fig 4B, S14 Fig and S35 Data). This acute contraction of the bimodal regime likely results from drastic amplifications of small noise spikes that drive the system to stay on [17]. Interestingly, the model predicts that bimodality is generated across approximately 13% of the parameter values for the HIV system (Fig 4B and S35 Data), in agreement with experimentally observed frequencies for spontaneous bimodal generation across the HIV-integration landscape [32]. Thus, HIV’s moderate feedback strength (S11 and S12 Figs and S32 Data) appears optimized to slow promoter-toggling kinetics into the regime that enables bimodality.\n\nRobust bimodality results from positive feedback decoupling expression noise from mean levels\n\nSince the circuit’s bimodality is ultimately dependent upon fluctuation-driven (i.e., stochastic) extinction of Tat, we next sought to determine how increasing expression levels influenced bimodality. In the classical Poisson or super-Poissonian transcriptional burst models [50], the expression mean scales with variance (σ2 ∝ μ) such that the noise magnitude (CV2 = σ2 / μ2) decreases proportionally to the inverse of the mean squared (Fig 5A) and the extinction probability can be shown to be as follows (S1 Text):\n\nHowever, nonlatching positive feedback breaks the Poissonian relationship such that σ2 ∝ μN with 1 &lt; N &lt; 2 [44]. In the extreme case where N = 2, CV2 becomes independent of the mean and the extinction probability becomes the following (S1 Text):\n\nwhere σ2NFB and μNFB are the variance and the mean for the nonfeedback case, respectively. Importantly, Eq 2 shows that stochastic extinction can be decoupled from the mean (when N = 2), and simulations verified that such perfect decoupling was possible (Fig 5B). Analysis of the experimental data in Fig 3 shows that the Tat circuit displays partial decoupling of noise and mean with N ≈ 1.5 (Fig 5C). Thus, Tat circuitry enables greater stochastic extinction over a broader range than other circuitries (e.g., no feedback or latching positive feedback) would be able to achieve.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn summary, HIV’s Tat circuit seems particularly well suited for generating bimodal expression patterns, and alternate single-parameter mechanisms for Tat function (e.g., increasing burst frequency alone rather than slowing toggling kinetics) appear to severely limit or completely abrogate the potential for bimodality. The precise architecture of this robust bimodal-generator circuit in such a rapidly adapting virus suggests that bimodality in HIV expression (i.e., latent and active replication modes) may be a beneficial trait that has been selectively maintained [38]. In contrast with other known roles for positive feedback (e.g., bistability and noise amplification), these findings demonstrate a further role for positive feedback as a mechanism for robust generation of bimodality [51]. On a conceptual level, this ability of positive feedback to expand the bimodal regime into physiological ranges may be related to positive feedback’s ability to expand the regime where sustained oscillations occur [52,53]. Consequently, positive-feedback circuits may have evolved not only for signal amplification but also to stabilize certain dynamic phenotypes (e.g., bimodality and oscillations) in diverse biological systems.\n\nFrom a basic HIV biology standpoint, these results on Tat’s mechanism of action may have therapeutic implications for HIV cure approaches. Specifically, Tat protein addition reactivates HIV latency more potently than current chromatin remodeling latency-reversing agents (LRAs) such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) [42]. Despite the known role of Tat as a transcriptional elongation factor, there has been no clear mechanistic explanation as to why Tat protein is more potent than LRAs that are transcriptional activators (e.g., HDACis). Conventional LRAs (e.g., protein kinase C [PKC] agonists and HDACis) only affect kON, and we have previously shown that agents that simultaneously reduce kOFF and kON potentiate reactivation [54]. Hence, the finding herein that Tat alters kOFF, coupled with the magnitude of the Tat-induced kOFF change, provides a mechanistic explanation as to why Tat is so effective for latency reversal. The findings also suggest that Tat-based strategies and conventional LRA strategies could be used synergistically, and new approaches aimed at simultaneously reducing kOFF and increasing kON would be optimal for “shock-and-kill” strategies, while conversely increasing kOFF and decreasing kON would be optimal for “block-and-lock” strategies.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nMolecular cloning procedures\n\nThe sequence of Tat from recombinant clone pNL4-3, GenBank: AAA44985.1, M19921, was used. To clone the LTR-mCherry-IRES-Tat-FKBP construct, d2GFP was swapped with mCherry using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites [27]. To clone the Tet-Tat-Dendra-FKBP plasmids, Tat-Dendra or Tet-Tat-Dendra was swapped with YFP-Pif from the pHR-TREp-YFP-Pif plasmid (a gift from Wendell Lim’s laboratory at UCSF) using BamHI and NotI restriction sites. The full-length virus was generated as described [27].\n\nPreparation of the GFP standard curve\n\nFor the GFP standard curve, a stock solution of 1 g/L (= 30.58 μM) recombinant eGFP (Cell Biolabs) was diluted 500-, 1,000-, 5,000-, and 10,000-fold (= 61.12, 30.58, 6.11, and 3.06 nM, respectively). These soluble GFP standards of known concentration were imaged in an 8-well chambered imaging dish using the same confocal microscope settings as subsequent cellular GFP imaging.\n\nCellular GFP imaging\n\nIsoclonal populations were incubated with shield for 20 hours (if applicable). Approximately 6 x 105 cells were washed with 2 mL of PBS solution and then immobilized on a Cell-Tak (Fisher) coated 8-well chambered imaging dish, using the manufacturer’s protocol. Both soluble GFP standards and cellular GFP were imaged on a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped with a W1 Spinning Disk unit, an Andor iXon Ultra DU888 1k x 1k EMCCD camera, and a Plan Apo VC 100x/1.4 oil objective in the UCSF Nikon Imaging Center; the exposure time was 500 ms with 50% laser power. Approximately 15 xy locations were randomly selected for each isoclonal population. After background and autofluorescence subtraction from the cellular GFP images, the cellular GFP concentration was determined from the GFP standard curve. The cellular volume was approximated from the measured cellular dimensions, assuming a spherically shaped cell.\n\nRecombinant virus production and infections\n\nLentivirus was generated in 293T cells and isolated as described [32,55]. To generate the isoclonal closed-loop circuit populations, lentivirus was added to Jurkat T Lymphocytes at a low MOI to ensure a single integrated copy of proviral DNA in the infected cells. The cells were stimulated with TNFα and Shield-1 for 18 hours before sorting for mCherry. Isoclonal and polyclonal populations were created as described [32]. The sorting and analysis of the cells infected was performed on a FACSAria II. Inducible-Tat cells were generated by transducing Jurkat cells with Tet-Tat-Dendra-FKBP and SFFV-rTta lentivirus at high MOI [27]. The cells were incubated in Dox for 24 hours and then FACS sorted for Dendra+ cells to create a polyclonal population. To create the Tet-Tat-Dendra-FKBP + LTR-mCherry cells, the polyclonal population was infected with LTR-mCherry lentivirus at a low MOI. Before sorting for mCherry+ and Dendra+ cells, Dox was added at 500 ng/mL for 24 hours, and single cells were FACS sorted and expanded to isolate isoclonal populations.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\n\nFlow cytometry data were collected on a BD FACSCalibur DxP8, BD LSR II, or HTFC Intellicyt for stably transduced lines and sorting. Flow cytometry data were analyzed in FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, Oregon, United States) and using customized MATLAB code [27].\n\nMathematical model and stochastic simulations\n\nA simplified 2-state model of LTR toggling and Tat positive feedback was constructed based on experimental data of LTR toggling [24,36] and simulated using the Gillespie algorithm [56] in MATLAB to test how altering toggling kinetics and feedback strength would affect the activity of the circuit. At least 1,000 simulations were run for each condition.\n\nAlternatively, to sweep the parameter space of different modulations of the Tat circuit, the accurate chemical master equation (ACME) method [57,58] was used to directly solve the chemical master equation (CME) to obtain the full probability landscapes of protein copy number. For each parameter pair in the sweeping, the protein probability landscape was computed at day 3 or at steady state. The phenotype of bimodality or unimodality at different parameter pairs was based on the numbers and locations of probability peaks in the landscape using the bimodality analysis approach described in the Materials and methods section.\n\nBimodal analysis\n\nTwo approaches were taken to quantify whether a distribution from the experimental data or simulations was bimodal or unimodal. The first, applied to both simulations and experimental data, was to convert the fluorescence density data using the bkde function in the KernSmooth package in R to a binned kernel density [59]: the KernSmooth R package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KernSmooth/index.html. To filter out biologically irrelevant noise in the data, the data points with fluorescence density less than 1 or small peaks lower than 0.05 in calculated kernel density function were ignored. The number of modality peaks was determined by calculating the second-order derivative of the kernel density. The second approach, only applied to the experimental data, was to utilize the Hartigan Dip Test, a dip statistic that can test for multimodality by testing for maximal differences and ascertain the probability that a particular distribution is unimodal [39]. Code for the Hartigan Dip Test was obtained from http://nicprice.net/diptest/, adapted from Hartigan’s original Fortran Code for MATLAB.\n\nSupporting information"
