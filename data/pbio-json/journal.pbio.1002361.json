  "abstract": "Amyloids are ordered protein aggregates that are typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. By contrast, the amyloid-like state of the neuronal RNA binding protein Orb2 in Drosophila was recently implicated in memory consolidation, but it remains unclear what features of this functional amyloid-like protein give rise to such diametrically opposed behaviour. Here, using an array of biophysical, cell biological and behavioural assays we have characterized the structural features of Orb2 from the monomer to the amyloid state. Surprisingly, we find that Orb2 shares many structural traits with pathological amyloids, including the intermediate toxic oligomeric species, which can be sequestered in vivo in hetero-oligomers by pathological amyloids. However, unlike pathological amyloids, Orb2 rapidly forms amyloids and its toxic intermediates are extremely transient, indicating that kinetic parameters differentiate this functional amyloid from pathological amyloids. We also observed that a well-known anti-amyloidogenic peptide interferes with long-term memory in Drosophila. These results provide structural insights into how the amyloid-like state of the Orb2 protein can stabilize memory and be nontoxic. They also provide insight into how amyloid-based diseases may affect memory processes.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nAmyloids, whose cross-β fold has been postulated as the ancestral protein fold [1,2], were initially associated with fatal neurodegenerative disorders [3,4]. However, more than a century after the identification of these “pathological amyloids,” a growing list of so-called “functional amyloids” that fulfils a wide variety of physiological functions has recently emerged [5]. The discovery of functional amyloids raises the question of what causes such a strikingly distinct behaviour to that observed in pathological amyloids. Indeed, it remains unclear what features are shared by functional and pathological amyloids and what determines whether a particular amyloid is functional rather than toxic.\n\nOne functional amyloid-like protein of particular interest is the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB). The CPEB family of proteins regulates the translation of dormant mRNAs [6,7], and some members of this family are involved in synaptic plasticity and long-lasting memory [8,9]. The CPEB isoforms share a common C-terminal catalytic region (RNA-binding domain), but they differ in the N-terminal region. Surprisingly, the N-terminus of some CPEB isoforms in Aplysia, Drosophila, and mouse have features characteristic of self-sustaining amyloidogenic (prion-like) proteins [9–13]. For example, the neuronal specific isoform of Aplysia CPEB (ApCPEB) has a glutamine-asparagine (Q/N)-rich N-terminal domain, which resembles a yeast prion-like domain (PLD) [14], and it is predicted to have conformational flexibility [10]. Indeed, ApCPEB undergoes a conformational transition to a β-sheet-rich state similar to that undertaken by other prion-like proteins [15]. In sensory neurons, the neurotransmitter serotonin controls the prion-like switch from the monomeric form to the self-sustaining oligomeric state, which is important for the serotonin-induced increase in synaptic strength [16]. Accordingly, it has been postulated that the switch to the oligomeric and self-perpetuating state contributes to the long-term maintenance of synapse-specific changes [16], providing a molecular mechanism for the persistence of memory [10].\n\nThe Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of CPEB, Orb2, has two isoforms that are structurally similar to the ApCPEB isoform: Orb2A and Orb2B [17,18]. Both forms are expressed in the fly brain and they are required for long-term memory [11,17,19]. Orb2A, a synaptic protein, is scarce, and its availability is controlled by phosphorylation [19, 20]. This isoform has eight amino acid residues (YNKFVNFI) preceding the PLD, which are critical for both the efficiency as well as the nature of the amyloid-like oligomers being formed [11]. The longer Orb2B isoform, with a region of 162 residues preceding the PLD, appears to act as a canonical CPEB [21], regulating translation via its RNA-binding domain [18,21]. The PLD of Orb2A has a low Q/N content compared to ApCPEB (23.5% versus 48.1%), it acts in long-term memory independently of its RNA-binding domain [21], and its mutations prevent memory consolidation [11,17].\n\nThe nervous system is particularly susceptible to amyloid-driven diseases, some of which lead to severe cognitive deficits [22]. Currently, it remains unclear why some amyloids in general are detrimental for neurons, while a seemingly similar amyloid state of some neuronal CPEB proteins is critical for memory stabilization [9,11]. As with other biological conundrums, a structural/functional analysis of CPEB/Orb2 proteins may shed light on the features that distinguish functional from pathological amyloids, and it may also help us to understand the molecular basis of memory consolidation. Here, we have employed an array of in vitro (bulk and single-molecule biophysics as well as cell culture) and in vivo (Drosophila and yeast) techniques to characterize Orb2 amyloid both structurally and functionally. In addition to dissecting out the characteristics of the Q/N-rich PLD-containing region of Orb2, we have found that a known anti-amyloidogenic peptide inhibits some forms of memory consolidation in Drosophila. Furthermore, comparing with pathological amyloids, we found that although in solution Orb2 can form toxic oligomers, these toxic species rapidly progress to innocuous species. These transient Orb2 species are structurally similar to toxic Huntingtin aggregates and, when abundant, these two proteins form a heteromeric complex. These findings indicate that there are intrinsic structural constraints that prevent functional amyloids to dwell in the toxic conformation. These observations also provide clues as to how pathological amyloids may interfere with the function of those beneficial amyloids.\n\nResults\n\nOrb2 Forms Canonical Amyloids Very Efficiently\n\nBoth the endogenous and the recombinant Orb2 protein form sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and urea-resistant oligomers that are characteristic of amyloids [11]. However, it remains unclear to what extent the Orb2 amyloid behaves as a typical pathological amyloid. Both recombinant Orb2A and Orb2B bind to thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) dyes (Fig 1A–1C and S1A Fig), and this binding is inhibited by amyloid destabilizing reagents such as rottlerin [23] or the polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG: S1B Fig) [24,25]. The soluble form of both full-length isoforms has a helix-rich secondary structure monitored by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig 1D). However, over time both isoforms become rich in amyloid-specific β-sheets, as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig 1E), which coincides with aggregation of the protein, as monitored by turbidimetry (Fig 1F). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed Orb2A to form spherical oligomers and typical unbranched amyloid fibers (Fig 1G). Interestingly, Orb2A adopted an amyloid structure more efficiently (without the typical lag phase) than other amyloids like the Aβ42 peptide or the yeast prion Sup35NM, with a t½ of ~15 min and at a protein concentration 8–10-fold lower (S1C Fig). Based on these observations, we conclude that, in isolation, Orb2A not only forms seemingly canonical amyloid structures but it also does so in an extremely efficient manner.\n\nPrion-like Properties of Orb2A\n\nIn order to determine whether Orb2A amyloid possesses the self-sustaining properties of prion-like proteins, we took advantage of the well-characterized yeast prion Sup35, a translation termination factor that can exist in two states: as an active monomeric state (nonprion) and as a less active amyloid state (prion) [26]. The conversion between those two states can be readily assessed by non-sense suppression of the mutant ade1-14 allele. In the nonprion state of Sup35, yeast colonies appear red in rich media, and they cannot grow in media containing a limiting amount of Adenine (-ade media), while in the prion-state, read-through translation turns the colonies white and cells can grow in -ade media. We substituted the NM prion domain of the Sup35 protein with the N-terminal domain of Orb2A, Orb2B or a paralogue of Orb2 in Drosophila, Orb1 (Fig 1H, left), and these chimeric constructs were expressed under the control of Sup35 promoter, representing the sole source of the Sup35 protein [27]. While all these chimeric proteins substituted the essential function of the Sup35 protein, only Sup35 carrying the N-terminal domain of Orb2A produced two readily distinguishable phenotypes: red Ade- [prion-] and white Ade+ [PRION+] colonies (Fig 1H, right). The Orb2A N-terminal domain produced the prion-like state with an unusually high frequency and perpetuated stably through hundreds of generations. Random selection of 100 colonies revealed that almost 50% of them spontaneously gave rise to white-pink Ade+ colonies for Orb2A, compared to ~1% for Orb2B and none for Orb1 (Fig 1H, right). Furthermore, the nonprion and prion-like states correlated with the monomeric and SDS-urea resistant amyloidogenic oligomeric states of Orb2, respectively (S1D Fig). These results indicate Orb2A is very efficient in adopting a self-sustaining amyloid-like state.\n\nBoundaries and Conformational States of the Orb2A PLD\n\nA group of the prion-like proteins characterized to date contain a PLD that is disordered and frequently composed of a Q/N rich sequence with a low content of charged residues [28–30]. In Orb2A, the entire PLD is composed of an N-terminal Q/N-rich domain (88 residues with 35.2%Q+N, Fig 1A), which is followed by a 74-residue region containing few charged residues (6.8% compared to 21.6% in the rest of the Orb2A protein).\n\nPLDs often adopt distinct conformational states, such as coiled-coil rich [31] or stacked β-sheet rich structures [32–36]. The conformational switch can be gauged through their susceptibility to proteases [37]. To determine the region of Orb2A PLD that adopts distinct conformational states, we inserted the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition motif (ENLYFQG) at the N-terminus of EGFP-tagged Orb2 protein (Fig 2A), and we measured the accessibility of the TEV protease to these sites [38]. Insertion of the TEV protease sites at the positions indicated in Fig 2A did not alter the ability of Orb2 to oligomerize (S2A and S2B Fig) or bind to mRNA (S2C Fig). We found that the TEV protease site located outside the N-terminal of Orb2A or Orb2B (Orb2A162TEV, Orb2A216TEV and Orb2B370TEV) was cleaved efficiently and equivalently in both the oligomeric and the monomeric forms (Fig 2B). However, when the TEV site was located within the first 162 residues of Orb2A (Orb2A88TEV), or within the first 242 residues of Orb2B (Orb2B242TEV), most of the oligomers and a fraction of the monomers were not cleaved by TEV after 24h incubation with TEV protease (Fig 2B). This differential cleavage of monomers implies that: i) the 88 N-terminal residues are not inherently inaccessible; and ii) there is a conformational variability even among monomeric forms.\n\nTo further explore the conformational variability in the monomer population and to rule out the possibility that resistant monomers were not simply oligomers that have dissociated, we obtained protein fractions containing primarily monomeric Orb2 by differential centrifugation. When the TEV protease site is within the first 162 residues of Orb2A, only a fraction of the monomeric protein is accessible to TEV (S3 Fig). These results suggest that the N-terminal Q/N rich region that ends at residue 162 is most likely the boundary of the PLD and that this domain can adopt at least two distinct conformational states: a protease-accessible monomeric state and a protease inaccessible state in both monomeric and oligomeric forms (Fig 2B and S3 Fig).\n\nDissection of the Orb2A PLD\n\nPLDs are often organized such that two distinct regions mediate the initiation of aggregation and recruitment to the aggregate for self-perpetuation. To determine whether the Orb2A PLD has this organization, we studied the recruitment of red-labelled proteins into EGFP-labelled preformed aggregates using a cell fusion-based assay [39]. Three distinct Orb2AΔPLD-Cherry fluorescent protein constructs that lacked specific regions of the PLD were generated: Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry, Orb2AΔ88-162-Cherry, or Orb2AΔ1-162-Cherry. We fused S2 cells carrying Orb2A-EGFP to Orb2AΔPLD-Cherry expressing cells by inducing the expression of the Caenorabditis elegans epithelial fusion failure 1 (EFF-1) protein [39], which causes cell fusion via a homotypic interaction and the mixing of cytoplasmic but not nuclear components (Fig 2C). While Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry expression appeared mostly diffuse by itself, in the fused cells this protein variant formed large puncta (Fig 2D). Orb2AΔ88-162-Cherry formed few puncta by itself but co-aggregated efficiently with full-length Orb2A-EGFP to form large fluorescence puncta. By contrast, Orb2AΔ1-162-Cherry, which lacks the entire PLD, failed to form any such aggregates (Fig 2D). Since only Orb2A-EGFP efficiently induced the formation of Orb2AΔ88-Cherry puncta but not EGFP, Orb2B-EGFP, or Orb1-EGFP, these results indicate that the intramolecular interaction is highly specific (Fig 2E). Surprisingly, the Orb2A protein from D. willistoni, which is ~81% identical to the D. melanogaster protein, forms puncta when it is expressed in S2 cells. However, Orb2A from D. willistoni failed to induce the aggregation of Orb2AΔ88-Cherry into puncta (Fig 2D), indicating that this is a species-specific process. These data suggest that the organization of Orb2A’s PLD resembles that of other prion-like proteins, whereby the first 88 residues are important for initiating aggregation, and residues 88–162 are important for the recruitment into preformed aggregates.\n\nA Single Point Mutation in Orb2A Affects Its Amyloidogenic and Prion-like Properties\n\nOne surprising feature of PLDs is that although the domains can substitute each other, the amino acid sequence of the various PLDs are distinct. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent individual amino acids at various positions contribute to the prion-like properties. Intriguingly, previously we found that a F to Y substitution at the 5th position of the Orb2A PLD—representing the addition of a single hydroxyl group—dramatically reduced Orb2 oligomerization and impaired memory consolidation [11]. This prompted us to determine the role of the 5th residue in amyloid formation and what aspects of amyloid formation (e.g., recruitment) and/or prion-like behaviour (i.e., self-sustaining properties) are affected by this mutation.\n\nTo address these issues, the F5 residue was substituted for 18 different residues (Fig 3A), and Orb2A puncta stability was quantified using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Remarkably, substitution of F5 with any residue except the highly hydrophobic ones (V, I, L, or W, only exception being E) strongly destabilized Orb2A oligomers (Fig 3B). ThT binding to Orb2A variants correlated with FRAP results, and the Orb2AF5Y mutant showed the weakest enhancement in ThT fluorescence (Fig 3C). To determine whether this 5th residue might also play an important role in oligomer packing, in addition to affecting the rate of Orb2A oligomerization, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. FRET efficiency depends on the distance between the fluorophores, which in turn depends on the orientation and packing of the protein subunits in the homo-oligomer. Surprisingly, only the F5L, F5W, F5S, F5Q and F5P (One-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05) substitutions produced an average FRET efficiency similar to the efficiency observed in the wild-type protein. Moreover, the F5Y substitution produced aggregates with very variable FRET efficiency, whereas all other substitutions decreased the average FRET efficiency (*p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the nature of the 5th residue is important in oligomer packing (Fig 3D). Thus, the 5th residue of Orb2A seems to mediate a key intramolecular interaction important for the oligomerization process [40].\n\nWe then asked whether this perturbation in oligomer packing and stability affected the prion-like behaviour of Orb2A (see Fig 1H). Remarkably, this single residue substitution dramatically interfered with the capacity of the Orb2A’s PLD to adopt a stable prion-like state, as concluded from a chimeric yeast prion assay (Fig 3E), coinciding with the reduction in the SDS-urea resistant amyloidogenic oligomeric states (Fig 3F). The Orb2AF5Y-EGFP mutant also impaired the formation of Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry puncta (Fig 3G), and this PLD variant exhibited impaired capability to aggregate, as measured by turbidimetry and far-UV CD spectroscopy (S4A and S4B Fig). This mutant also has decreased ability to form amyloid components, according to a CR binding assay (S4C Fig) and oligomers/fibers, as assessed by TEM (S4D Fig). Taken together, these results corroborate the critical role of the F5 residue of Orb2A for its self-sustaining recruitment and amyloidogenic properties reported to be necessary for memory consolidation [11]. These results also suggest that there are inherent structural features determined by specific amino acid residues that control the Orb2A amyloid formation.\n\nOrb2 Shares Common Features with the Pathological Amyloidogenic Pathway\n\nThe possible existence of intrinsic differences (related to protein structure or/and dynamics) between functional and pathological amyloidogenic pathways prompted us to carry out a comprehensive analysis on the various stages of amyloid formation.\n\nThe monomeric species of amyloidogenic proteins represent the starting point and a key determinant of the amyloidogenic cascade. The conformational changes that occur in the monomeric protein are difficult to study with bulk structural techniques because of the coexistence of many conformational states in a dynamic equilibrium. However, single-molecule techniques, like atomic force microscopy-based single molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS), allow the determination of the conformational diversity of these monomers [41]. We focused on the disordered region comprising the first 162 amino acid residues of Orb2A-PLD (S5A Fig) as the sequence that is necessary and sufficient for prion-like behaviour and amyloid formation, as well as for memory consolidation [21]. We performed AFM-SMFS in the length-clamp mode (at a constant pulling speed of 0.4 nm/ms) in order to compare the amyloidogenic properties of Orb2A PLD with those of pathological amyloids at the monomer level [41]. As a single-molecule reporter, we constructed a fusion protein whereby the Orb2A PLD was mechanically protected inside the fold of a reference protein (carrier), rendering it amenable to unequivocal single-molecule analysis (S5B Fig). Prior to AFM-SMFS analysis, to verify that both the PLD region and the carrier in the fusion protein preserve their structural integrity, we performed 1D 1H and 2D 1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and far-UV CD spectroscopies (S5C–S5E Fig). Furthermore, turbidimetry analysis, CR binding, and negative-staining TEM experiments corroborate that the PLD region maintains its amyloidogenic properties when protected inside the fold of the carrier (S6 Fig).\n\nFor SMFS analysis, after fitting the force-extension recordings to the worm-like chain (WLC) model of polymer elasticity [42,43], we found that Orb2A PLD exhibited a rich mechanical conformational polymorphism that could be classified into two general classes of conformers depending on their mechanical resistance to unfolding (F): nonmechanically resistant, or NM, (F ≤ 20 pN, 62.3% NM) and mechanically resistant, or M, (F &gt; 20 pN, 37.7% M) conformers (Fig 4A, S7 Fig and S1 Table). Within the M class, a variety of monomeric conformers with different mechanical stabilities were observed. These conformers showed resistance barriers (often more than one per molecule) located at a number of positions, as measured by the length released upon unfolding (increase in contour length, ΔLc), indicating the high conformational diversity of Orb2A PLD (Fig 4A, S7 and S8A–S8C Fig). Like in other pathological amyloids [41], we observed extremely stable M conformers whose unfolding forces approached the values needed to break a covalent bond [44]. Intriguingly, it must be noted that some of these M conformers might be related to the prion conformers stabilized by strong noncovalent forces thought to account for prion inheritance and transmission [37]. Interestingly, the F5Y mutation showed a significantly reduced conformational polymorphism, as measured by SMFS (10.1% of M conformers; Fig 4A and S8D–S8F Fig). This reduction is in agreement with the decreased ability of the F5Y variant to form self-perpetuating amyloids (Fig 3 and S4 Fig) and the failure to stabilize memory beyond 48 h [11].\n\nFurthermore, Orb2 shares additional features with pathological amyloids at later stages. This includes formation of toxic oligomeric species (Fig 4B) recognized by the conformational antibody A11 [45] as well as the formation of unbranched fibers recognized by the conformational antibody OC (Figs 4C and 1G), which also recognizes fibrillar oligomers and mature fibers in the Aβ assembly [46]. Taken together, these data suggest that the Orb2A PLD monomer samples a wide conformational space, consistent with our TEV protease analysis (Fig 2B and S3 Fig), and that Orb2A follows an amyloidogenic pathway reminiscent of pathological amyloids [41].\n\nOrb2 Forms Transient Toxic Oligomers\n\nThe similarities in the amyloidogenic cascade between Orb2A and pathological amyloids led us to wonder why, despite these common features, Orb2A is functional rather than toxic to the cell. One possibility is that the lifetime of the toxic oligomers formed by Orb2A and pathological amyloids is different. To test this possibility, we first used the two aforementioned conformational specific antibodies raised against Aβ: A11 [45] and OC [46]. We found that Orb2 initially formed A11-reactive SDS-sensitive oligomers that rapidly (minutes time scale) evolved to form at least two different OC-reactive species: a SDS-sensitive species and a more mature, SDS-resistant species (Fig 5A). By contrast, A11-reactive species formed by Aβ42 were stable in solution for days (Fig 5B).\n\nIn the light of these data, and to determine whether the transient Orb2 oligomers are indeed cytotoxic, we used conformational trapping with two small inhibitors (Fig 5C): EGCG [24,47] and Amphotericin B (AmB) [48]. We found that AmB slowed down Orb2A assembly and arrested it in the A11-reactive conformation, while EGCG seemed to direct the protein to the fibril state through a pathway that does not involve the formation of toxic A11-reactive oligomers (Fig 5D). To test cell viability, the different samples were microinjected into cultured cells [49]: Orb2A and the Orb2A:EGCG complex, in which Orb2A is stabilized in the OC-reactive conformation, were not cytotoxic, similar to the negative controls (Fig 5E and 5F, S9 Fig). By contrast, the Orb2A:AmB complex, which is stabilized in the A11-reactive oligomeric state, caused extensive and acute cell death 24 h after microinjection (Fig 5E and 5F, S9 Fig). Notably, incubation of the Orb2A:AmB complex with a very low concentration of the conformational A11 antibody (complex:A11, 100:1) attenuated this toxicity, indicating that toxicity was indeed due to the A11 specific conformation acquired by Orb2A (Fig 5E and 5F, S9 Fig).\n\nTo determine whether these differences in kinetic parameters are inherent features of nontoxic and toxic amyloids, we performed a domain swapping analysis between Orb2A and a disease-associated version of Huntingtin Htt exon 1 (ex1HttQ72). We compared ex1HttQ72 with two chimeric proteins in which the PLD and the Q-rich region have been swapped (S10A Fig). When the Q-rich region of ex1Htt was substituted with Orb2A PLD, it formed nontoxic, short-lived species reactive to the A11 antibody, similar to Orb2A (see Fig 5A). Conversely, the substitution of the PLD of Orb2A by the Q-rich region of the expanded ex1Htt resulted in the formation of stable A11-reactive species that exhibited a high cytotoxicity, similar to that found for ex1HttQ72 (S10B–S10D Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that Orb2A can form a toxic conformer, which structurally resembles that of toxic amyloids. However, intrinsic structural features in Orb2A-PLD renders this toxic conformation rare and transient; furthermore, it appears that Orb2A may have evolved to form mature amyloidogenic oligomers much more efficiently than pathological amyloids.\n\nOrb2 Can Be Trapped by Pathological Amyloids\n\nOur observations suggest that in solution, Orb2 and polypeptides that form pathological amyloids sample similar conformational ensembles. We wondered whether in spite of being transient and rare, because of their structural similarity, these Orb2 transient toxic conformations could be hijacked by similar, yet longer-lived conformers from neurotoxic amyloids. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed EGFP-tagged Orb2A protein with the Huntingtin protein-containing expanded polyQ repeats (HttQ128) in the larval motor neuron. HttQ128, unlike Orb2A, is neurotoxic, and its chronic expression produces lethality [50]. In contrast to when it is expressed alone, Orb2A formed larger fluorescence puncta in the presence of HttQ128, indicative of its aggregation, and in some cases these Orb2A puncta were surrounded by HttQ128 protein (Fig 5G and S11A Fig). The effect of HttQ128 on Orb2 appears to be specific, given that it had no obvious effect on other EGFP-tagged proteins, such as the synaptic protein synaptotagmin or the Golgi-associated protein GRASP-65, used as negative controls (Fig 5G and S11B Fig). Similarly, removal of the PLD from Orb2A abrogated its HttQ128-enhanced aggregation (Fig 5G). Since the structural properties of Orb2A are similar to those of the NM PLD of yeast prion Sup35, we also studied a chimeric protein in which the Orb2A PLD was substituted with the Sup35 PLD. Consistent with the structural studies, this chimeric construct was also recruited into the HttQ128 aggregates (Fig 5G and S11C Fig). These results suggest that pathological amyloids, when present in excess, can nucleate Orb2A aggregation, presumably by capturing the transient toxic conformers of Orb2 proteins.\n\nA Small Anti-amyloidogenic Peptide Blocks Orb2 Amyloidogenesis\n\nPolyglutamine-binding peptide 1 (QBP1) is a known inhibitor of the amyloidogenesis of HttQ expansions. This hydrophobic peptide binds monomeric expanded polyQ proteins and blocks the initial critical β-conformational transition of these species, suppressing their subsequent oligomerization and fibrillogenesis, and consequently, the associated cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration [41,49,51–53]. QBP1 acts as a polyvalent anti-amyloidogenic agent on several amyloids [41], and thus, we examined the potential inhibitory effect of the minimal active core of QBP1 (Ac-WKWWPGIF-NH2) [54] on Orb2A amyloid formation. The conformational similarity at the monomer level between Orb2 and HttQ prompted us to further examine whether QBP1 could inhibit Orb2A amyloid formation.\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed that QBP1 physically interacts with Orb2A, and that complex formation, a slow event, was exothermic in nature (Fig 6A). Under similar conditions, a scrambled version of QBP1 (SCR, Ac-WPIWKGWF-NH2) [54] interacted poorly, serving as a negative control in the subsequent experiments (Fig 6A). Unlike the SCR, incubation with QBP1 inhibited Orb2A PLD aggregation and amyloidogenesis, as monitored by turbidimetry and CR binding (Fig 6B and 6C). Far-UV CD spectroscopy revealed that QBP1, but not SCR, suppressed Orb2A PLD signal loss due to protein precipitation (Fig 6D). Furthermore, TEM showed a significant reduction in the formation of both oligomers and fibers in the presence of QBP1 but not the SCR (Fig 6E) compared to Orb2A PLD alone (see Fig 4C). Consistent with these results, the SMFS analysis revealed that Orb2A PLD treated with QBP1 formed fewer M conformers (from 37.7% to 16.1%), shifting the NM/M proportion towards an increased population of NM conformers, while SCR had no effect on this initial conformational transition (Fig 6F and S12 Fig). Together, these results indicate that QBP1 interferes with Orb2 amyloid formation in vitro and suggest that early in amyloidogenesis, Orb2 and some pathological amyloid-forming polypeptides adopt similar conformations that are recognized and blocked by QBP1.\n\nQBP1 Interferes with Memory Consolidation\n\nBased on the fact that QBP1 inhibits the transition from the monomeric Orb2A state to conformations that lead to amyloid formation, we tested in D. melanogaster the physiological consequences of QBP1 expression on memory consolidation. To this end, we used the male courtship suppression memory paradigm, in which a virgin male repeatedly exposed to unreceptive females learns to suppress courtship towards them, and this learned suppression persisted for days. Using the Gal4-UAS system, the QBP1-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or SCR-CFP peptides were expressed panneuronally [53]. QBP1 expression in the nervous system, or that of the control SCR, did not affect fly development, although normal courtship behaviour was slightly dampened (S13 Fig). Following training, both experimental flies (Elav-Gal4:UAS-QBP1-CFP or SCR-CFP) and the genetic controls (Elav-Gal4 and UAS-QBP1 or UAS-SCR) displayed a similar suppression of courtship immediately after training, suggesting that the expression of these peptides does not interfere with learning or short-term memory. However, when measured after 24 h, the Elav-Gal4:UAS-QBP1 males displayed elevated courtship compared to the Elav-Gal4:UAS-SCR control flies, indicative of a loss of long-term memory (Fig 7). To determine whether QBP1-mediated memory loss is independent of Orb2, we expressed QBP1 in Δ80QOrb2 flies that lack N-terminal Q-rich 80 amino acid residues of Orb2 (Fig 7). The Δ80QOrb2 flies form short-term memory but no long-term memory [11,17]. Expression of QBP1 in Δ80QOrb2 had no additive effect in the loss of long-term memory (Fig 7). Since QBP1 is a low affinity peptide that can only block early stages of oligomerization but not already formed oligomer, we also investigated the consequence of transient expression of QBP1 in courtship suppression memory. To this end, we used RU486-inducible GeneSwitch Elav-Gal4 system and induced expression of the QBP1 peptide in the adult flies 24 h before training [55]. Transient expression of QBP1 had no effect on the long-term courtship suppression memory (S14 Fig). Finally, to determine whether chronic expression of QBP1 results in general disruption of the nervous system, we trained the ElavGal4-UASQBP1 flies in a heat-box paradigm (S15 Fig). In this operant conditioning paradigm, flies learn to avoid one side of an otherwise symmetrical chamber [56]. Intriguingly, the heat box paradigm produces robust short-term memory, but the memory does not persist beyond an hour or two. The memory curve of QBP1 was similar to that of wild type flies, suggesting that QBP1 expression does not interfere with the animal’s ability to form short-lived memories (S15 Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that chronic QBP1 expression can interfere with some form of long-term memory and the effects of QBP1 in memory may be partly mediated through Orb2.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAmyloids were discovered and primarily studied in the context of disease or nonfunctional states of proteins. The unique structural features of amyloids set them apart, endowing them with extraordinary stability and, in some cases, the unique capacity to self-perpetuate in a dominant manner [37]. The recent discovery of functional amyloids raises some fundamental questions as to what makes some amyloids pathological and others beneficial, how similar the structures of pathological and functional amyloids are, and how they are formed.\n\nWhat Separates Toxic and Nontoxic Amyloids?\n\nHere we have analyzed the structural states of Orb2A, an amyloidogenic protein that is important for memory consolidation. We find that Orb2A not only forms self-perpetuating amyloids but it does so extremely quickly and efficiently. Surprisingly, Orb2A has several structural features and properties that are similar to those of pathological amyloids (Fig 8). First, the Orb2A monomer shows a rich conformational polymorphism with mechanical stabilities similar to those of the well-characterized pathological amyloids [41]. Second, Orb2 binds to the conformational antibody A11, which detects the toxic oligomeric species of pathological amyloids [45]. Third, like pathological amyloids, Orb2A can form unbranched amyloid fibers and pre-fibrillar oligomers that react against the conformational antibody OC [46,57–60]. Finally, Orb2A amyloid formation is inhibited by QBP1, a peptide capable of inhibiting amyloid formation in expanded polyQ tracts [41,51].\n\nWhat makes Orb2A PLD beneficial despite sharing all these features with pathological amyloids? Orb2 amyloid-like oligomers are formed in response to neuronal stimulation to support memory, which indicates the existence of a highly regulated mechanism in the cell to drive Orb2 amyloid formation and most likely to avoid the toxicity of its A11-reactive oligomers. One such regulation is the tight control of the Orb2A protein level via phosphorylation [20] and possibly other mechanisms. Here we show the existence of additional intrinsic kinetic factors in Orb2A, i.e., the lifespan of A11-reactive oligomers, which is probably related to its efficiency to form a functional amyloid state. We postulate that although the early events in Orb2 amyloid formation are similar to those of pathological amyloids, in subsequent steps it acquires structural features to rapidly evolve to a nontoxic amyloid-like state (Fig 8). For Orb2 proteostasis, these intrinsic structural features could be further enhanced in the cell by association with other components or by the direct modification of proteins, such as phosphorylation [20]. Both the presence of A11-reactive oligomers and the ability to form amyloids efficiently have been also reported for the intracellular nonpathological amyloids of the yeast Sup35 prion [48], which suggests that this may be a general mechanism for some amyloids to avoid cytotoxicity. Still, it must be noted that neuronal CPEB/Orb2 is the only known functional amyloid-like protein in the nervous system. This distinction is fundamental for two reasons: first, the nervous system is particularly susceptible to amyloid-based disease and; second, amyloids are known to interfere with cognitive abilities including memory.\n\nAmyloid-like States as a Stable Substrate of Memory\n\nThe persistence of memories over months and years raises the fundamental question of how memory is protected against molecular turnover [61]. Structural changes in individual proteins and in supramolecular protein assemblies have been proposed to play an important role in long-term memory [62,63]. The prion features of the specific neuronal CPEB isoform, such as Orb2 in Drosophila [11], or CPEB3 in mouse [9,12] that can adopt a self-sustaining state at synapses very rapidly, provide a plausible solution as to how memories can remain stable in the face of constant molecular turnover [10,16,64]. Although exactly to what extent the self-sustaining amyloidogenic properties observed in vitro reflect the in vivo properties remains unclear, accumulating evidence reinforces the hypothesis that an amyloid-like state of neuronal CPEB is involved in long-lasting memory. In this regard, the present study provides evidence that mutations in Orb2, such as the 5th residue in Orb2A, that are known to interfere with memory consolidation also impair the protein’s ability to attain a self-sustaining amyloidogenic state as monitored by in vitro measurements. Similarly, the expression of QBP1, an amyloid-blocking peptide, impairs memory consolidation (Fig 8). However, we are not sure whether the memory-disrupting effect of QBP1 is applicable for all forms of long-term memory or whether the effects of QBP1 in memory are mediated exclusively through the Orb2 protein. Furthermore, in the absence of atomic-level 3D structural analysis of endogenous CPEB protein in the amyloid-like state, it remains unclear exactly to what extent they are similar to toxic amyloids.\n\nOur observations also highlight certain features of functional amyloids that may be relevant for neuropathologies of amyloid-based diseases. First, the short life span of Orb2 toxic oligomers supports a therapeutic approximation based on speeding up the conversion of toxic oligomers into stable amyloids [65]. Second, Orb2’s capacity to form toxic conformers resembling those of pathological amyloids, and its sequestration into HttQ128 aggregates (Fig 8), suggests that pathological amyloids might hijack Orb2 into a nonfunctional state, impairing its physiological activity. Third, anti-amyloidogenic compounds that target early stages of amyloidogenic pathways might inadvertently interfere with functional amyloid formation, impairing their associated function. Finally, the polyvalent amyloid blocker QBP1, or improved analogues based on its recently determined structure [66], could be used in the future to block newly formed traumatic memories (Fig 8) [67]. However, we are cognisant of the inherent limitations of our ideas since none of our studies are carried out with human proteins in the human nervous system. These anticipated connections of our in vitro findings with memory need to be explored in detail.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThT Binding Assay\n\nThe ThT binding assay was performed essentially as described previously [68]. Briefly, 400 picomoles of protein/100 μl aliquot were taken at the time indicated and mixed with 700 μl of 25 μM ThT (Sigma) in 50 mM Glycine buffer (pH 8.5). The reaction mix was excited at 442 nm, and the emission at 482 nm was measured using a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorimeter, and three independent measurements were taken for each sample. To obtain the ThT enhancement fluorescence due to Orb2 alone, the 6 M GdnHCl-PBS buffer was dialyzed similarly, and for each time point, the fluorescence of ThT in this buffer was subtracted.\n\nFTIR Spectroscopy\n\nFTIR spectroscopy was carried out using the same His-tagged recombinant proteins used in ThT binding assay. FTIR was performed with a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a ZnSe multibounce ATR accessory. The instrument was corrected for ATR penetration. Spectra were collected at 2 cm-1 resolution and averaged over 64 scans. Samples were precipitated by addition of methanol to a final concentration of 50% and incubated overnight at 4°C. Pellets were spread on the ATR and dried with a stream of air before each measurement. Spectra were corrected for water vapor by subtracting the background collected immediately after each scan scaled to fit the local shape of the spectrum in the 1,600–1,700 cm-1 region. The liquid water spectrum was subtracted by matching the signal at 2,200 cm-1 to a liquid water spectrum via linear least squares. A linear background between 1,580 and 1,720 cm-1 was subtracted, and the spectrum in this region was normalized to obtain the final spectrum. The resulting spectra were fit to four Gauasian peaks with nonlinear least squares. All subtractions and fittings were performed using custom plugins written in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and are available at http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins. The 1,620 cm-1 band with a width of ~13 cm-1 was assigned to extended cross-β sheet structures only found in amyloid proteins. The 1,637 cm-1 band with a width fixed at 13 cm-1 was assigned to typical β-sheet structures such as those found in concanavalin-A. The 1,655 cm-1 band with a width fixed at 13 cm-1 was assigned to random coil and α-helical structure. Finally, the 1,678 cm-1 band with a width fixed at 13 cm-1 was assigned to turns. In addition, FTIR was performed after incubation of the precipitated pellets in D2O for 1 h, and a minimal change in the α-helical content was observed, suggesting the absence of pervasive random coil structure.\n\nSelf-Sustaining Yeast Prion Assay\n\nFor the chimeric yeast prion assay, we have used the methods developed previously [69]. Briefly, the N-terminal domains of Orb2A, Orb2B, and Orb1 were optimized for expression in yeast and cloned into TopoDonor vector (Invitrogen). Using pAG414SUP35-ccdB-SUP35C (LEU, CEN plasmid, Sup35 promoter, SUP35C domain) Gateway vector and LR clonase (Invitrogen), the N-terminal domains, were fused in frame to Sup35C domain to create the chimeric construct [69]. The Orb2-Sup35C (LEU selectable marker) construct was introduced into W303aΔsup35 strain [MATa; leu2-3, 112; his3-11,-15; trp1-1; ura3-1; ade1-4; can1-100; SUP35::HygB; [psi-];[PIN+]] via plasmid shuffling. The yeast were grown in YPD media and plated on either YPD-agar or SC-agar lacking adenine and the [PSI+] colonies were selected 2–3 d after plating. Selected colonies were grown in YP-glycerol plates to avoid petites. To discard that phenotypes are not due to mutation in the Orb2-Sup35C, the plasmid was isolated from both cell types and sequenced, and white phenotypes were rescued by transforming the cells with plasmid expressing just the C-terminal domain of Sup35 protein. To determine the heritability of the prion-like state, individual red or white colonies were streaked for multiple times.\n\nDifferential Centrifugation of the Cell Extract and the TEV Protease Assay\n\nS2 cells expressing the Orb2A-EGFP, Orb2B-EGFP, Orb2A88TEV-EGFP, Orb2AA216TEV-EGFP, Orb2B242TEV-EGFP, or Orb2B370TEV-EGFP constructs were lysed in PBS buffer containing 0.1% NP-40 and protease inhibitors (Roche). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove the cell debris and nuclei, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 174,000 × g in a TLA120.2 rotor for 2 h. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet fraction was resuspended in PBS + 0.1% NP40 buffer in a volume equal to the supernatant. For western blotting, 7.5 μl of the lysate, and 15 μl of the supernatant and pellet fractions, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For TEV protease digestion, approximately four times the volume of the pellet fraction was used compared to the supernatant fraction to normalize for the amount of Orb2A and Orb2B present. TEV digestion was performed overnight at 4°C with 1 μg of recombinant purified TEV protease. To analyze Orb2A-EGFP and Orb2B-EGFP from fly heads, the ultracentrifugation protocol was modified by using 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer instead of the NP-40/PBS buffer.\n\nAntibodies\n\nAll anti-Orb2 antibodies were raised against recombinant six histidine-tagged full-length Orb2A proteins. The antibody 273 was raised in rabbits (Covance), and antibody 2233 was raised in guinea pigs (Pocono). All antibodies were affinity purified against Orb2A protein. For western blots, the antibodies were used at the following dilutions: Ab273, 1:1,000 dilution; Ab2233, 1:2,000 dilution; and Ab402, 1:2,000 dilution. The chicken anti-EGFP antibody (abCAM) was used at 1:5,000, and all secondary antibodies (Cell Signalling) were diluted 1:10,000.\n\nWestern Blotting and Immunoprecipitation\n\nFor all biochemical analyses, freshly prepared head extracts were used unless mentioned otherwise. For western blotting, fly heads were homogenized (2–4 μl of buffer/head) in PBS buffer I, containing: 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche). Where applicable, the extracts were also treated with 50 ng/ml of purified RNaseA (Qiagen). The total homogenate was incubated at 4°C for 30 min with rotation, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the cleared supernatant was collected. To detect Orb2 protein, extracts from approximately five head equivalents were resolved on a 4%–12% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) or on 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane for 16 to 18 h at 30 mV in a cold room. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-Tween-20 buffer and incubated with the affinity-purified antibodies indicated for 12 to 16 h at 4°C with constant agitation. The antibody-antigen interaction was visualized by chemiluminescence using HRP-coupled anti-rabbit (for Ab273 or anti-guinea pig (Ab2233) secondary antibodies (Pierce).\n\nFor immunoprecipitation, fly heads were homogenized in PBS buffer I, and the lysates were clarified twice by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Then, ~ 2 mg of total protein from unstimulated brain extracts and ~ 0.5 mg of total protein from stimulated brain extracts were incubated with 0.5 to 1 μg of the purified antibodies for 2 h at 4°C. After 2 h, the lysates were incubated with protein A beads (Repligen) for a further 2 h, and the beads were washed five times with the PBS buffer I. The protein bound to the beads was analyzed in western blots (as described above).\n\nRNA Pull-Down Assay\n\nThe head extracts were prepared in a buffer containing: 20 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, 0.2 mg/ml tRNA, 0.25% BSA, complete mini protein inhibitor (Roche), 40 units/ml RNase plus inhibitor (Promega). The RNA and protein (~2 mg of total protein) were incubated in the buffer with rotation for 40 min at RT. Pre-equilibrated Streptavidin Paramagnetic Beads (Roche) were added to each binding reaction, and the mixture was incubated for a further 40 min. The beads were then captured with a magnet, washed five times for 10 min with extraction buffer, and boiled in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The supernatant and pellet fractions were prepared as described above. To obtain biotin-labelled RNA, the 3’ UTR of the Oscar, Tequila, Murashka, and Actin88F genes were cloned into the TopoII vector (Invitrogen), and biotin-labelled RNA was prepared using Megascript RNA synthesis kit (Ambion) in the presence of Bio-17-ATP and Bio-11-CTP. The RNA was purified, and ~ 2 μg of biotin-labelled RNA was incubated with the supernatant and pellet protein extracts. The protein/RNA complexes were recovered with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal). The amount of supernatant and lysate used in the control lanes is 5% the amount used for RNA binding.\n\nS2 Cell Transfection and EFF-1 Cell Fusion Assay\n\nS2 cells were transfected with the constructs indicated using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cotransfected cells were plated the next day on concanavalin-A-coated glass-bottom dishes (Mattek) and analysed by confocal microscopy. For EFF-1 fusion experiments, we cloned the ORF of C. elegans eff-1 gene into the copper inducible vector pMTV5HisB (Invitrogen). The Orb2 constructs were cloned into the Pac5.1HisB vector (Invitrogen) under the constitutively active actin promoter. Cells were cotransfected with pMT EFF1 and pAc5.1EGFP-tagged ORF’s or pMT EFF-1 and pAc5 Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry as indicated. One day later, the cotransfected cells were mixed, and fusion was initiated by adding CuSO4 to the media, thereby inducing EFF-1 expression. After 16 to 18 h, the cells were plated on concanavalin-A (Sigma)-coated mattek glass-bottom dishes, and the cells containing both GFP and Cherry were detected manually by confocal microscopy.\n\nComputational Predictions\n\nOrder/disorder prediction for Orb2A protein was made using a consensus artificial neural network prediction method, Predictor Of Naturally Disordered Regions PONDR-FIT (Molecular Kinetics). This metapredictor was developed by combining the outputs of several individual disorder predictors (PONDR-VLXT, PONDR-VSL2, PONDR-VL3, FoldIndex, IUPred, and TopIDP) and significantly improved the prediction accuracy when compared to its individual component predictors [70]. Orb2A PLD sequence was also analyzed by applying the Rosetta-Profile algorithm, which identifies sequence segments that form the steric-zipper spines of amyloid fibrils [71].\n\nDot Blot Assay\n\nOrb2 PLD samples and Orb2A/ex1Htt chimeric proteins (20 μM) were incubated at 37°C without stirring in PBS (pH 7.0), and 2 μl of each sample obtained at selected intervals was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The Orb2A/ex1Htt chimeric proteins were constructed by overlapping PCR cloning, using as template a clone that contains the full sequence for HttQ72 [72]. For EGCG and AmB immunodot blot analysis, the Orb2A monomer was prepared by protein denaturation in 6M GdmCl (as 0 min reference time) and then dialyzing in 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) + 150 mM NaCl to a final concentration of 2.5 to 5 μM. DMSO (AmB vehicle), or a 4:1 molar excess of AmB and EGCG was added. After blocking for 1 h at RT with 10% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membrane was incubated for another 1 h at RT with the polyclonal specific anti-oligomer A11 antibody (Life Technologies) or the fiber-specific monoclonal antibody OC (Millipore), diluted 1:1,000 in 3% BSA TBS-T. The membranes were then washed three times for 5 min each with TBS-T before being incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit HRP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) diluted 1:5,000 in 3% BSA/TBS-T at RT. After washing the membranes three times in TBS-T buffer, the blots were developed with the ECL Plus chemiluminescence kit from Amersham-Pharmacia (GE Healthcare). Prefibrillar oligomers and fibrillar species of Aβ42 were used as positive controls for A11 and OC reactivity, respectively.\n\nIn the case of full-length Drosophila Orb2A and Orb2B, recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified under denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteins were dialyzed against 1 M Urea, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 5% Glycerol containing buffer at RT. Dialysis was performed in a Slide-A-Lyzer mini Dialysis unit with a 7,000 MWCO (Pierce). For the A11 antibody (Biosource) immunoreactivity assay, 2 μl of the dialysed proteins at the time indicated were spotted on Protran BA3 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schhuell). The membranes were blocked overnight in TBS + 5% milk and then incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of the A11 antibody for 1 h at RT. The binding of the A11 antibody was visualized with a HRP-tagged secondary antibody using Supersignal West Femto substrate (Pierce).\n\nSingle-Cell Protein Microinjection\n\nThe COS-7 cell line was grown and maintained in supplemented DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS (Life Technologies). The day before performing microinjections, cells were plated on a 35 mm dish at a density of 1 x 105 cells per dish. Just before single-cell microinjection, Orb2A protein (2.5 μM in PBS [pH 7.4]) was incubated in the presence or absence of a 4-fold molar excess (10 μM) of AmB and EGCG for 100 min at 37.0°C to allow complex formation. The Orb2A:AmB:A11 ternary complex was formed by incubating the previously formed Orb2A:AmB binary complex for 3h at RT with the A11 antibody (100:1, binary complex:A11). Using a micromanipulator (Narishige), the samples were microinjected into the cytoplasm of single COS-7 cells double-blind (n = 100 to 200 cells per sample and repeated three times for each sample), along with fluorescein-labelled dextran (10,000 MW, Life Technologies), and fluorescence microscopy images were acquired using a CCD camera model C4742-95-12ER (Hamamatsu Photonics). Dextran, 1% DMSO, Vamp2Cyt and AmB were also microinjected as negative controls. Cell viability was monitored under an IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus) by counting the number of fluorescein-positive cells displaying a healthy morphology 3 h after microinjection, and this value was assigned as 100% cell viability. Over the following 3 d, the number of fluorescein-positive cells was counted every 24 h to calculate the cell survival rate. The Orb2A/ex1Htt chimeric proteins were microinjected in the same conditions. The data are represented as the mean ± SEM, using two-way ANOVA and a Bonferroni post-test, and one-way ANOVA and a Tukey post-test for statistical analysis of the time course survival curves and survival rates after 24 h, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).\n\nITC\n\nITC experiments to examine the interaction of full-length Orb2A with the minimal active core of the QBP1 and SCR peptides [54] were carried out in a VP-ITC microcalorimeter at 25°C. The proteins were equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.4) by gel-filtration chromatography, and the equilibration buffer was used to prepare the peptide solutions. Protein/peptide binding was tested by successive injections of the protein (10 to 25 μl each) into the reaction cell loaded with peptide at a high final (peptide)/(protein) molar ratio. The apparent heat of reaction for each injection was obtained by integration of the peak area. The heat developed with the protein or peptide dilutions was determined in separate runs, loading the sample cell or the injection syringe with buffer in the conditions used for the binding experiments. The complexity of the system and the lack of precise information on the distribution of the Orb2A conformations before and after complex formation precluded the quantitative analysis of the titration curves. The protein (Orb2A, 185 μM) and ligand (QBP1 and SCR, 300 μM and 51 μM, respectively) concentrations in the loading solutions were measured spectrophotometrically using their respective extinction coefficients.\n\nDrosophila Strains\n\nWe used the following Drosophila strains obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: Elav-Gal4 (stock no. 458), Drl-Gal4 (stock no.4669), and UAS-GFP (stock no. 1522). The following transgenic lines were generated by us for the research described here: UAS-Orb2A-EGFP, UAS-Orb2B-EGFP, UAS-Orb2Δ88-EGFP, UAS-Orb2Δ162-EGFP, and UAS-Sup35NM-Orb2A-EGFP. Various genetic combinations were made by standard genetic crosses. We also used the UAS-QBP1 and UAS-SCR lines in which QPB1 and SCR were expressed at a similar level in fly heads when they were expressed under the gmr-Gal4 driver [53]. Flies expressing HttQ128 were previously described [50].\n\nFor the behavioural assays, the flies were maintained using standard fly husbandry. Briefly, flies were raised on standard cornmeal food at 25°C and 60% relative humidity on a 12 h/12 h light:dark cycle. All flies (1 d old) were collected and placed in a vial with fresh food for 24 h at 25°C prior to behavioural testing, and all transgenic lines were backcrossed at least six times with white-eyed Canton-S flies. All controls and transgenic lines carried one copy of the mini white gene known to influence fly behaviour.\n\nMale Courtship Suppression Assay\n\nThe male courtship conditioning assay was modified from that described previously [73]. A five-d-old male virgin was paired with a freshly mated female for three sessions of 2 h each, with a 30 min rest period in between. Memory performance was tested with a fresh-mated female 5 min and 24 h after the three sessions of spaced training. A courtship index (CI) was measured as the fraction of time the tested male spent chasing the female in a 10 min interval. The Memory Index was calculated as: CI¯Naive−CI¯TrainedCI¯Naive×100, where CI Naive and CI Trained are the mean courtship indices for independent samples of naive and trained males, respectively. GraphPad Prism version 4.0 was used for statistical analysis. We assumed statistical significance at *p &lt; 0.05. One-way ANOVA was used for comparing memory index between each genotype.\n\nHeat Box Paradigm\n\nThe heat box apparatus was built in the workshop of Konrad Ochsner at the Universitiy of Wuerzburg and is a modified version of the one used by [74]. In brief, the heat chamber system consists of an array of 16 chambers (length, 29 mm; width, 4 mm; height, 2 mm) operated in parallel. Upper and counter ceilings are equipped with Peltier elements that control the temperature in the chamber. Glass side walls allow the transmission and detection of infrared light from an LED source (invisible to the flies). When a fly walks along the length of the chamber, it casts a shadow on a bar code reader (light gate array), and this signal is sent to a computer. The fly position signal from the bar code reader is sent to the computer with a frequency of 10 Hz. All experiments were conducted in complete darkness. Measurements are performed on at least three different days to avoid effects of daily variability. The experiment consists of a preference test, training and memory test. A computer controls the experiment in all three phases by continuously monitoring the time and direction of transition at the light gate. One half of the chamber is defined as the punished side and the other half as the unpunished side. These designations are switched for every experiment to avoid aftereffects of previous experiments (e.g., pheromones or stress signal). During the preference test (30 sec), the fly can explore the chamber at a constant temperature of 24°C, providing a measure of experience-independent spatial preference. In the training phase (4 min) the whole chamber is heated at 37°, whenever the fly enters the punished side and cools down to 24°C when it enters the unpunished side. In the following 3 min test phase, the temperature is kept constantly at 24°C. The performance index (PI) is calculated as the difference between the time the fly spent in the unpunished versus that in the punished side of the chamber divided by the total time. Thus, the PI can range from −1 to 1, with a PI of 0 indicating no side preference. The PI is a measure of heat avoidance and memory score during the training and memory test, respectively. To yield a measure of general activity, the sum of position changes over time is calculated. The thermosensitivity assay is recorded adjusting the temperature in the front versus back half of the chamber independently and also independent of the flies’ actions. It is stepped from 24°C on both sides to 24°C/37°C and 24°C/41°C for 1 min intervals, sequentially alternating the side with the higher temperature. The time spent on a given side is measured, and heat avoidance indices are calculated as above (PI). All animals that do not show substantial motor activity or do not experience punishment were excluded from the study.\n\nAdditional Methods\n\nComplete and detailed information on the cloning process for all the constructs used in this work, for the protein/polyprotein (pFS-2) sample preparation, or for protein expression and purification, can be found in [41]. A complete list of the oligonucleotides used here can be found in S2 Table.\n\nThe details of the experimental procedure and the analysis performed for the CR binding assay, far-UV CD spectroscopy, TEM imaging, 1-D 1H and 2-D 1H NOESY NMR spectroscopy, turbidimetry, and AFM-SMFS can be found elsewhere [41]. Additional information regarding FRAP and FRET can be found in [11]. The buffers, incubation times, and storage conditions, and the protein/peptide concentrations used in the aforementioned techniques, are detailed below.\n\nCR binding assay\n\nSamples were aged for 7 d at 37°C with 0.02% NaN3 and no stirring prior to performing the measurements. The protein samples (10 μM) were dialyzed in PBS (pH 7.0), and the SCR and QBP1 peptides were used at 50 μM.\n\nCD spectroscopy\n\nFor far-UV CD spectra, we used a protein concentration of 2–5 μM in 5 mM NaH2PO4, with 0.02% NaN3 (pH 6.0). The QBP1 or SCR (when used) were 5-fold molar excess relative to the proteins (final concentrations 10 to 25 μM with a final concentration [v/v] of DMSO below 0.01%). After recording the first protein spectrum (time 0), the protein was incubated at 37°C without stirring, and additional spectra were collected at the times indicated.\n\nTurbidimetry\n\nProtein samples were used at 10 μM in PBS + 0.02% NaN3 (pH 7.0) for all the kinetic experiments. The samples were incubated at 37°C without stirring, and the SCR and QBP1 peptides were used at 50 μM.\n\nTEM imaging\n\nProtein samples (10 μM) were dialyzed in PBS (pH 7.0) to obtain all the TEM measurements. Images were taken after 7 d of incubation at 37°C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3 without stirring, and the SCR and QBP1 peptides were used at 50 μM.\n\nNMR spectroscopy\n\nFor 1-D 1H and 2-D 1H NOESY NMR spectra recorded at 25°C, we used a protein concentration of 150–300 μM in NaH2PO4 (pH 6.6–6.9) with 10% D2O and 50 μM DSS in some duplicate samples as the internal chemical shift reference.\n\nAFM-SMFS\n\nExperiments were performed using 2–3 μM polyproteins in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at RT with proteins incubated at 4°C between sessions and using NTA-Ni2+ functionalized coverslips. For experiments in the presence of the QBP1 and SCR peptides, we used 20 μM of the peptide dissolved in DMSO and the samples were incubated overnight with the peptide at 4°C before taking measurements.\n\nSupporting Information"
