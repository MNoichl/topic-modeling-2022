  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nThe amplification of DNA is an essential step in most nucleic acid–based testing strategies. Established amplification techniques rely on sophisticated instrumentation, such as temperature-regulating equipment or complex sample-handling procedures. While unproblematic for specialised laboratories, these requirements have hampered the uptake of nucleic acid analyses in point-of-use and field settings. The technology presented in this study, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), overcomes the technical difficulties posed by current DNA amplification methods. It does not require thermal denaturation of template and operates at a low and constant temperature. In combination with a novel probe-based detection approach, RPA constitutes a significant advance in the development of portable and widely accessible nucleic acid–based tests.\n\nIn RPA, the isothermal amplification of specific DNA fragments is achieved by the binding of opposing oligonucleotide primers to template DNA and their extension by a DNA polymerase (Figure 1A). Global melting of the template is not required for the primers to be directed to their complementary target sequences. Instead, RPA employs recombinase-primer complexes to scan double-stranded DNA and facilitate strand exchange at cognate sites [1–3]. The resulting structures are stabilised by single-stranded DNA binding proteins interacting with the displaced template strand, thus preventing the ejection of the primer by branch migration [4]. Recombinase disassembly leaves the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide accessible to a strand displacing DNA polymerase, in this case the large fragment of \n\t\t\t\tBacillus subtilis Pol I (Bsu, [5]), and primer extension ensues. Exponential amplification is accomplished by the cyclic repetition of this process. The key to RPA is the establishment of a dynamic reaction environment that balances the formation and disassembly of recombinase-primer filaments (Figure 1B). The recombinase we have employed, T4 uvsX, binds cooperatively to oligonucleotides in the presence of ATP. The resulting nucleoprotein complex actively hydrolyses ATP, and spontaneous recombinase disassembly in the ADP-bound state can lead to its replacement by T4 gp32, a single-stranded DNA binding protein necessary for the reaction. We found that a unique combination of T4 uvsY, a recombinase loading factor [6], and a particular crowding agent (Carbowax20M) establishes favourable reaction conditions that support RPA (see \n\t\t\t\tProtocol S1 and \n\t\t\t\tFigures S1 to \n\t\t\t\tS3). The proteins used in our approach are central components of in vivo processes required for cellular DNA synthesis, recombination, and repair and have been the subject of intensive research for a number of years [7]. In addition to facilitating DNA amplification in the RPA context, the dynamic reaction environment described here provides a system for the in vitro study of the recombination machinery and will aid the development of laboratory procedures that replace conventional hybridisation techniques.\n\n      Results/Discussion\n      \nWe applied the RPA process to a wide variety of targets in complex DNA templates. The versatility and specificity of the technology are exemplified by the amplification of three genetic markers, apolipoprotein B (apoB), sex-determining region Y (Sry), and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBDG), from complex human genomic DNA (Figure 2A). While the negative controls did not produce a signal, clean amplification products of the correct identity (\n\t\t\t\tFigure S4) were generated in each template-containing sample.\n\nThe progression of RPA reactions can be monitored in real-time by the inclusion of a sensitive nucleic acid dye (Figure 2B) [8]. Here, primers for a locus in the \n\t\t\t\tB. subtilis genome have been used. The amplification of DNA proved to be exponential over a wide range of template concentrations and results were obtained in less than 30 min. The onset of amplification depends linearly on the logarithm of the starting number of template copies. Reactions carried out in the absence of template or at low template concentrations eventually generated a nonspecific signal, an effect brought about by a primer-dependent artefact (Figure 2B, water control).\n\nTo devise a highly sensitive RPA detection system that is not affected by primer artefacts, we developed a probe-based detection method (Figure 3A). The probe we use contains a tetrahydrofuran abasic–site mimic (THF) [9], flanked in close proximity by nucleotides modified with a fluorophore and a quencher. The fluorescence of the intact construct is low. A block at the 3′-end prevents the oligonucleotide from acting as an amplification primer. Pairing of the probe to complementary DNA enables the recognition of the THF by the double-strand–specific \n\t\t\t\tEscherichia coli endonuclease IV (Nfo) [10]. The need for formation of a stable DNA duplex acts as an additional specificity-proofreading step in the context of our detection approach. Subsequent cutting of the probe separates the fluorophore/quencher complex and leads to a measurable increase in fluorescence. The cleavage reaction generates a free 3′ OH-end on the 5′ remnant of the incised probe. This oligomer can then be elongated by Bsu polymerase, thus serving as an amplification primer.\n\nTo demonstrate the performance of combined RPA and probe/nuclease-based read-out, we designed primers and probes for the detection of the common hospital pathogen methicillin-resistant \n\t\t\t\tStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA; \n\t\t\t\tFigure 3B) [11]. The sensitivity and reproducibility of RPA were explored by the amplification of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome \n\t\t\t\tmec (SCC\n\t\t\t\tmec) integration locus of the isoform MRSAIII (Figure 4A, see \n\t\t\t\tProtocol S1 for sequences). The onset of amplification at identical starting template quantities of ten, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 copies was virtually simultaneous, demonstrating the robustness of the technique. A plot of the time of beginning amplification against the logarithm of starting copy number reveals a linear relationship (Figure 4B). At low template amounts (two copies), the amplification times are distributed over a wider period, with one reaction failing to generate a signal at all, and the correlation between onset of amplification and template concentration breaks down. However, product detection in samples with such low template concentrations supports the notion that RPA can essentially attain single template copy sensitivity.\n\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of RPA allow the design of a multiplex approach in which different amplicons are generated and detected in the same reaction. Three polymorphic alleles of the SCC\n\t\t\t\tmec integration region represent the vast majority of known MRSA genotypes (MRSAI through III; \n\t\t\t\tFigure 5A) [12]. While they share the genomic locus \n\t\t\t\torfX, they differ in the sequence of the SCC\n\t\t\t\tmec. The integrating elements of MRSAI and II are homologous to each other except for a 102–base-pair insertion/deletion, while the MRSAIII SCC\n\t\t\t\tmec is highly divergent. A primer shared by all alleles was designed for the common region (orfX), whereas primers specific for MRSAI/II and MRSAIII target the different SCC\n\t\t\t\tmec variants (sccI/II and III, respectively). To ensure detection of all three isoforms, we designed two highly homologous probes (to account for polymorphisms) for the common region (SATamra1 and SATamra2). Fusing the target sequences for the primers sccIII and orfX to an unrelated DNA sequence created an internal control for the reaction. To verify the activity of each sample, the amplification of this construct was monitored simultaneously with that of the MRSA targets using another probe of appropriate sequence and bearing a different fluorophore/quencher pair (BSFlc). We employed this combination of primers and probes to detected ten genomic copies of the three MRSA types (Figure 5B). By contrast, the closely related methicillin-sensitive \n\t\t\t\tStaphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 104 copies) serving as a negative control did not generate a signal, despite being amplified by suitable primers (see \n\t\t\t\tFigure S5). The internal control was concomitantly detected in all samples.\n\nThe combination of RPA and the described nuclease-sensitive fluorophore/quencher probes constitutes a DNA amplification/detection system that would require no other equipment than a simple handheld fluorometer, thus making quantitative DNA testing potentially accessible in a nonlaboratory point-of-care environment. We devised an even simpler detection approach by employing lateral-flow dipstick technology. This system is often used as a simple disposable diagnostic device. It employs pairs of specific antibodies to immobilise and detect entities containing two antigenic labels (Figure 6A). Reaction mixtures (see below) are applied to a sample pad soaked in visible gold particles that are coupled to an antibody recognising one antigen. The complexes then travel in a buffer stream through the membrane and an additional, immobilised antibody captures the second antigen. If the antigens are conjoined in a DNA duplex, a coloured line appears at a defined location on the strip. A second line of immobilised antibodies captures the gold-conjugated antibody directly, whether conjoined to the other antigen or not, and serves as a flow control for the strip. In a variation of our probe detection system, we produced such dual antigen complexes by coupling biotin- and carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-bearing oligonucleotides in RPA amplicons (Figure 6B). The 5′-biotinylated primer and its opposing counterpart ensure the efficient amplification of a target for probe binding. The probe, including a 5′-FAM label, an internal THF, and a 3′-blocking group, is incised by Nfo upon binding, creating a 3′ OH substrate for elongation by Bsu. The extension of the probe remnant stabilises its interaction with the biotin-labeled opposing strand and produces an amplicon that contains both antigens, biotin and FAM. The THF/3′ block prevents the production of biotin/FAM-containing primer artefacts, as processing of bona fide duplexes by Nfo adds a critical proofreading step. We used a multiplex approach similar to the one employed in \n\t\t\t\tFigure 5 to detect ten copies of each of the three MRSA isoforms and distinguish them from MSSA (Figure 6C). As before, we designed two highly homologous probes (to account for polymorphisms) for the common region (Lfs1 and Lfs2). RPA reactions were followed by the application of the reaction mixtures to the sample pads of lateral-flow strips. Samples containing the MRSA template created biotin/FAM-amplicons and generated visible signals on the antibiotin detection line. In contrast, the MSSA-containing negative control failed to produce a conjoined complex and gave rise to the flow-control line only.\n\nA number of research and clinical applications could benefit from employing RPA. Perhaps most obviously, the technology offers a significant breakthrough for the development of nonlaboratory devices. When integrated with handheld instruments or entirely equipment-free DNA detection systems, RPA will enable an easy-to-use testing system for a variety of pathogens as well as field kits for other applications.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Proteins and DNA.\n        \nCoding sequences for uvsx, uvsy, gp32, Bsu, and Nfo were amplified from genomic DNA (DSMZ, Braunschweig Germany), fused to hexahistidine-tags (N-terminal for uvsY, Bsu, and Nfo, C-terminal for uvsX and gp32), and cloned into suitable expression vectors. Overexpression and purification were done by standard protocols using nickel-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). Human genomic DNA was from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin, United States), \n\t\t\t\t\tB. subtilis DNA was from \n\t\t\t\t\tATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, United States), and \n\t\t\t\t\tS. aureus DNAs were a gift from Jodi Lindsay (University of London, London, England). \n\t\t\t\t\tS. aureus strains were EMRSA-3 (SCC\n\t\t\t\t\tmec type I; MRSAI), EMRSA-16 (MRSAII), EMRSA-1 (MRSAIII), and wild-type MSSA.\n\n        RPA conditions.\n        \nReactions were performed at 37 °C for 60 min or as indicated.

Excitation/detection was at 485/525 nm (SybrGreenI, BSFlc) or 530/575 nm (SATamra1/2). Measurements were taken every 30 or 45 s (multiplex experiment). Fluorescence probe data were normalised (subtraction of water control average) and preamplification baseline adjusted. The logarithm of the read-out was plotted against reaction time.\n\n        Lateral-flow strip detection.\n        \nFor lateral-flow strip experiments, two probes were used at 75 nM each:\n\nLfs1 5′-FAM-ccacatcaaatgatgcgggttgtgttaat(H)gaacaagtgtacagag-ddC-3′\n\nLfs2 5′-FAM-ccacatcaaatgatgcgggttgtgttaat(H)gagcaagtgtatagag-ddC-3′\n\nThe 5′-biotinylated forms of sccI/II and sccIII were utilised as primers. For each reaction (20 μl), 1 μl was diluted with 5 μl of running buffer (PBS/3% Tween) and applied directly to HybriDetect strips (Milenia Biotec, Bad Nauheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n      Supporting Information\n\n        Accession Numbers\n        \nThe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) accession numbers used in this paper are Bsu (NP_390787), T4 uvsX (NP_049656) T4 gp32 (NP_049854), T4 uvsY (NP_049799), apoB (AY324608), Sry (NM_003140), PBDG (AP003391), and Nfo (AP_002756) and SNP (SNP-ID rs693).",
