  "abstract": "A study of the evolutionary history of cortical folding in mammals, its relationship to physiological and life-history traits and the underlying cortical progenitor behavior during embryogenesis, explains the diversity of folding we see across modern mammals. The diversity of neocortical folding among mammals can be explained by two distinct neurogenic programs, which give rise to mammals with a highly folded neocortex and mammals with slightly folded or unfolded neocortex, each occupying a distinct ecological niche.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nDevelopment of the mammalian, and in particular human, neocortex involves various types of neural stem and progenitor cells that reside in the germinal layers of the cortical wall [1]–[5]. An increase in the proliferative capacity of these cells underlies the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex, notably the increase in neuron number. At the onset of mammalian cortical neurogenesis, neuroepithelial cells transform into apical radial glia (aRG), which repeatedly undergo mitosis at the apical surface of the ventricular zone (VZ) and typically divide asymmetrically to self-renew and generate either a neuron, an apical intermediate progenitor cell, a basal intermediate progenitor cell (bIP), or basal radial glia (bRG) (the latter two being collectively referred to as basal progenitors [BPs]) [1]–[5].\n\nIn contrast to aRG cells, BPs delaminate from the apical surface and translocate their nucleus to the basal-most region of the VZ to form a secondary germinal layer, the subventricular zone (SVZ), where they divide symmetrically or asymmetrically. In developing mouse neocortex, bIPs typically divide symmetrically to generate two post-mitotic neurons (neurogenic bIP) [5]–[8], whereas in the macaque and human, bIPs can also frequently undergo symmetric proliferative divisions (proliferative bIP) [5],[9],[10]. Similarly to aRG cells in the VZ, bRG cells in the SVZ divide both symmetrically and asymmetrically [9],[11]–[14], which leads to the proliferation of their population and their self-renewal, respectively [5]. Importantly, the symmetric proliferative divisions of bIPs and bRG cells result in the transit-amplification of BPs [9],[10],[12],[15],[16], which in turn allows for an increase in the efficiency of subsequent neuron generation [2],[5],[17],[18].\n\nIn mammals exhibiting an abundance of BPs during cortical neurogenesis, the SVZ becomes further compartmentalized into an inner (ISVZ) and outer SVZ (OSVZ), as first described in the macaque [19] and subsequently observed in several species in which bRG cells constitute a relatively high proportion of BPs [1]–[3],[5]. Moreover, bRG cells are characterized by radial fibers, which distinguish them from bIPs. These radial fibers of bRG cells in the OSVZ of gyrencephalic mammals typically have divergent, rather than parallel, trajectories to the cortical plate, which is thought to contribute to creating the folded cortical pattern observed in these species through the tangential expansion of migrating neurons [2],[3],[5],[20]. For this reason, and based on supporting evidence obtained in the gyrencephalic human and ferret and lissencephalic mouse, an abundance of asymmetrically dividing bRG cells in the OSVZ has been thought to be necessary for establishing a relatively large and gyrencephalic neocortex [1],[9],[11],[12]. However, subsequent work in the lissencephalic marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has shown that bRG cells may, in fact, exist in comparable abundance in the developing neocortex of both gyrencephalic and lissencephalic species [21],[22], indicating that bRG abundance alone cannot be sufficient for either establishing or increasing cortical gyrification. Rather, the mode of cell division, that is, symmetric proliferative versus asymmetric self-renewing, of bRG cells, and of BPs in general, may be a critical determinant of the extent to which gyrification occurs and the neocortex expands. Notably, despite considerable progress in the study of brain size evolution [23]–[25], the adaptive mechanism that has evolved along certain mammalian lineages to produce a large and folded neocortex is not known.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed physiological and life-history data from 102 mammalian species (Tables S1 and S2; Database S1). We show that a gyrencephalic neocortex is ancestral to all mammals and that GI, like brain size, has increased and decreased along many mammalian lineages. These changes may be reliably characterized by convergent adaptations into two distinct physiological and life-history programs, resulting in a bimodal distribution of mammalian species with regard to the gyrencephaly index (GI) and the amount of brain weight produced per gestation day. We explain the appearance of these two groups in mammalian evolution by the adaptation of differences in the lineages and modes of cell division of progenitor cells during corticogenesis. We predict that symmetric proliferative BP divisions are key to evolutionary changes in gyrification and expansion of the neocortex.\n\nResults\n\nThe Evolutionary History of Mammalian Gyrencephaly\n\nWe collected GI data (Figure S1) for 102 species sampled from every mammalian order and tested multiple models for GI evolution using a species-level supertree [26]. The model that conferred the most power to explain GI values across the phylogeny while making the fewest assumptions about the data (i.e., that had the lowest Akaike Information Criterion [AIC]) diverged significantly from a null model of stochastic evolution [27] and showed a disproportionate amount of evolutionary change to have occurred recently, rather than ancestrally, in mammals (Figure S2). We identified a folded neocortex (GI = 1.36±0.16 standard error of the mean [SEM]) as an ancestral mammalian trait (Figure 1). This result held even when additional hypothetical lissencephalic species were added to the root of the phylogenetic tree (Table S3).\n\nIt is apparent from ancestral and other internal node reconstructions (Figure S3) not only that GI is very variable, but also that reductions in the rate at which GI evolves have favored branches leading to decreases in GI (e.g., strepsirrhines and eulipotyphla) and accelerations in that rate have favored branches leading to increases in GI (e.g., carnivores and caviomorphs). A simulation of the average number of total evolutionary transitions between GI values evidences more affinity for transitioning from high-to-low than low-to-high GI values: the majority of high-to-low transitions (58.3%) occurred in species with a GI&lt;1.47; and the fewest transitions (16.7%) occurred across a threshold GI value (see below) of ∼1.5 (Figure S4). This finding indicates that, although there is an evident trend in mammalian history to become increasingly gyrencephalic, the most variability in GI evolution has been concentrated among species below a certain threshold value (GI = 1.5). We therefore present a picture of early mammalian history, contrary to most previous work, but which is gathering evidence through novel approaches [28],[29], that the Jurassic-era mammalian ancestor may, indeed, have been a relatively large-brained (&gt;10 g) species with a folded neocortex.\n\nGI Is Bimodally Distributed and Supports Two Principal Mammalian Phenotypes\n\nThe evolutionary effects of a folded neocortex on the behavior and biology of a species is not immediately clear. We therefore analyzed associations, across the phylogeny, of GI with discrete character states of 37 physiological and life-history traits (Table S2). Distinct sets of small but significant (R2≤0.23, p&lt;0.03) associations were found for species above and below a GI value of 1.5, indicating that these two groups of species adapt to their environments differently (Figure 2A). Although species above and below GI = 1.5 tend to fall within classical definitions of slow and fast life-histories, respectively, our results argue in favor of a dichotomy rather than a continuum and, additionally, bear out ecological and behavioral associations not historically bracketed in slow or fast life-history paradigms [30]. For example, the result that narrow habitat breadth and large population group size are associated with low-GI (&lt;1.5) species, whereas wide habitat breadth and large social group size are associated with high-GI (&gt;1.5) species, suggests not only that an ecological distinction be made for mammals between the population size of co-habitating individuals and the number of those individuals interacting socially, but also that the number of habitat types in which a species must compete may assert a positive selection pressure on neocortical evolution. Importantly, both the low-GI and high-GI groups are sampled from across the phylogeny, testifying to the absence of a phylogenetic signal in the establishment of the two groups and a functional role for GI in the evolution of life-history programs. Hierarchical clustering analysis also supports a bimodal distribution above and below a GI value of 1.5 (Figures 2B and S5).\n\nA Neocortical Threshold GI\n\nIn order to test the bimodal distribution explicitly, we regressed GI values against neuroanatomical traits typically identified with (and studied in the field of) neocortical evolution: brain weight, neocortical volume, and neuron number. We found that each scaling relationship could be explained comparably well by either a non-linear function (Figure 3A) or two grade-shifted linear functions, with the best-fit linear models drawing significantly different slopes for high-GI and low-GI species (Figure 3B–3D). Specifically, by plotting GI as a function of cortical neuron number, we were able to determine, with two significantly different linear regressions for high- and low-GI species (T = 4.611, degree of freedom [d.f.] = 29, p = 2.8×10−4), demarcating values of 1±0.11×109 neurons and 1.56±0.06 GI (Figure 3D), thus providing a neuron number correlate for the GI threshold. The deviation of these results from previous work, which have shown strong phylogenetic signals associated with both GI [31],[32] and neuron counts [33], may be explained both by our more than 2-fold increase in sampled species and the a priori assumption of previous work that GI and neuron number evolve as a function of phylogeny. Variation in GI, therefore, has not evolved linearly across the phylogeny, but has in fact been differentially evolved in two phenotypic groups.\n\nMore Efficient Neurogenesis in Large-Brained Species\n\nBy identifying an evolutionary threshold in the degree of gyrencephaly, as well as a correlate in terms of neuron number, we revealed the existence of two neocortical phenotypic groups, which found support in their distinct life-history associations (i.e., the GI is bimodally distributed and supports two principal mammalian phenotypes). These groups could be further divorced by accounting for the amount of brain weight accumulated per gestation day—a confident proxy for neonate brain weight per neurogenic period (Figure S6A and 6B)—which we show to be, on average, 14-times greater in high- compared to low-GI species (Figure 4). Notably, each GI group is constituted by both altricial and precocial species, so the degree of pre- versus post-natal development is not enough to explain the discrepancy in brain weight per gestation day in each group.\n\nRather, to explain the discrepancy, we introduced a deterministic model of cortical neurogenesis, using series summarizing seven neurogenic lineages (Figure 5A and 5B) and based on cell-cycle length, neuroepithelial founder pool size, neurogenic period, and estimates of relative progenitor-type population sizes (Tables 1 and 2). In total, 17 species were incorporated in the model, as we were limited by the number of species for which cortical neuron number was available. These species include species from four phylogenetic orders: Primata, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Didelphimorphia. We arrived at two models that show the highest reliability for predicting cortical neuron numbers in a range of species: a mouse neurogenic program, which implicates only asymmetrically dividing aRG and bRG cells and terminally dividing IPs (Figure 5A, lineages 1–3); and a human neurogenic program, which additionally implicates BPs undergoing symmetric proliferative divisions in the SVZ (Figure 5A, lineages 4–7). Each model is defined by the proportional occurrence of each lineage in that model (Table 2).\n\nUsing the mouse neurogenic program we were able to predict neuron counts within 2% of the observed counts for mouse and rat, but underestimated neuron counts by more than 80% in high-GI species (Figure 5C; Table S4). Increased proportional occurrences of the bRG lineage 3 (Figure 5A) with increasing brain size was required to achieve estimates with &lt;5% deviation from observed neuron counts in the other low-GI species (Table 2; Figure S7). The human neurogenic program predicted neuron counts within 5% for all six high-GI species, but overestimated neuron counts by more than 150% for the low-GI species. Estimates of proportional occurrences of the various lineages in the mouse, marmoset, rabbit, macaque, and human are supported by previous work detailing relative abundances of different progenitor cell-types during cortical neurogenesis [7],[9]–[11],[14],[22] (IK and WBH, in preparation). Evolutionary gain or loss of proliferative potential in the SVZ is an essential mechanistic determinant of neocortical expansion, such that the presence of symmetric proliferative BP divisions in high-GI species and their absence in low-GI species is sufficient and even requisite for explaining neocortical evolution (Figure S8). Notably, the lissencephalic opossum, a marsupial species with extreme altriciality, required a decreased proportional occurrence of the bIP-containing lineage 2 (Figure 5A) and an increased proportional occurrence of the direct neurogenic lineage 1 (Figure 5A) but, like all species analyzed here, could not achieve its observed neuron count without the bRG-containing lineage 3 (Figure 5A). This suggests that bRG cells are ancestral at least to the therian stem [34].\n\nAdaptive Evolution of Proliferative Potential in the SVZ\n\nTo simulate the adaptiveness of evolving increased proliferative potential in the SVZ in two lissencephalic species—mouse and marmoset—we calculated trade-offs between neuroepithelial founder pool size and neurogenic period using mouse/marmoset and human programs of cortical neurogenesis to achieve 109 neurons. We show that, in both species, evolving a lineage of BPs capable of symmetric proliferative divisions is between two and six times more cost-efficient than either expanding founder pool size or lengthening neurogenesis; and that the marmoset, by evolving such proliferative BPs, could achieve 109 neurons by increasing either its observed founder pool or neurogenic period less than 15% (Figure 6).\n\nWe further clarified the significance to neuron output of each progenitor-type with deterministic and stochastic models of temporal dynamics and progenitor cell-type variables. The proportional contributions of each lineage to overall neuron output in the mouse and human neurogenic programs were calculated using stage-structure Lefkovitch matrices. By excluding lineages one at a time, we determined the degree to which each lineage contributed to total neuron production. From these analyses, it was clear that symmetric proliferative BPs are increasingly necessary in larger brains and that any exponential increase in neuron production is statistically implausible in the absence of such BPs (Table S5).\n\nFinally, we described the dynamics of asymmetric self-renewing versus symmetric proliferative progenitors, isolated from their observed lineage beginning at the apical (ventricular) surface, by introducing three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) modeling a self-renewing cell that generates either a differentiated cell or proliferative cell. The ODEs describe a self-renewing mother progenitor, which can generate either a post-mitotic neuron or a proliferative daughter at each division. The proliferative daughter is allowed one symmetric proliferative division followed by self-consumption. The likelihood of a neuron or proliferative daughter being generated by the mother, therefore, is interdependent. We also include the pool of mother progenitors as a linear variable. We show that neuron output of the system increases dramatically when both the initial pool of self-renewing cells and the likelihood of those initial cells to generate proliferative, rather than differentiated, cells approaches saturation (Figure S9).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe emergence of new structures, in the most general sense, is typically limited to selection on existing developmental processes; and conserved pathways may persist, over evolutionary time, even when the phenotype is transformed or unexpressed [35]–[37]. However, it is also evident that development may be adapted without affecting phenotype (e.g., [38],[39]). Therefore, in order to understand selective pressures acting on a discontinuous or convergent trait, it is necessary to investigate the underlying developmental processes generating it.\n\nThe Evolution of Two Principal Mammalian Phenotypes\n\nWe have shown that a gyrencephalic neocortex is ancestral to mammals. This finding is concordant with evidence [29] that the mammalian ancestor was relatively large (&gt;1 kg) and long-lived (&gt;25-year lifespan) and, furthermore, provides considerable resolution to recent evidence for a gyrencephalic eutherian ancestor [28] by sampling nearly twice as many species and categorizing gyrencephaly as a continuous, rather than a binary, trait.\n\nMore surprisingly, we show that convergent evolution of higher orders of gyrencephaly along divergent lineages has been accompanied by two distinct constellations of physiological and life-history paradigms. Specifically, species with a GI&gt;1.5, which is commensurate with 1 billion cortical neurons, exhibit patterns of development and life-history that are distinct from species with a GI≤1.5, irrespective of phylogeny. This implies that there is a considerable constraint on either the ability of species of a given neocortical size to exploit certain ecologies or the potential for species of a given ecology to freely adapt neocortical size. Even marine mammals, whose selection pressures are sui generis, may largely be held to the same evolutionary stereotyping as terrestrial mammals (Figure S10).\n\nWhile our results countenance previous studies showing associations between physiological and life-history traits in mammals (see [40]), we identify those traits to have a bimodal distribution, rather than to vary allometrically, across species. This distribution depicts a Waddington-type landscape for neocortical expansion—albeit relevant at the species-level—wherein the GI threshold represents an adaptive peak requiring a particular adaptation in neurogenic programming within a population for traversal. Our results may explain this landscape by mechanistic differences occurring during cortical neurogenesis between species above and below the GI threshold: the necessity of symmetric proliferative BPs in high-GI species and their putative absence in low-GI species.\n\nNeurogenic Period, Not Programming, Is Sufficient to Differentiate High-GI Species\n\nThe human neurogenic program constructed here clearly shows that the same neurogenic lineages in the same proportions are required to generate the neocortices of Old World monkeys, apes, and humans, and may even be extended to carnivores, cetartiodactlys, and other high-GI species (Figure S10), demonstrating that neurogenic period alone may be sufficient to explain differences in neocortical size between any species in the same GI group (Figure S11). Our data are insufficient, however, to determine whether these adult differences are uniform across the neocortex or differentially represented in infra- versus supra-granular layers [20],[41].\n\nWe propose that symmetric proliferative divisions of BPs, in addition to having an abundance of bRGs in an expanded SVZ, are necessary and sufficient for the evolution of an expanded and highly folded neocortex in mammals. Recent work in the fetal macaque supports this proposal [10]. We thus conclude that an increase in the proliferative potential of BPs is an adaptive requirement for traversing the evolutionary GI threshold identified here. But because we reconstruct the eutherian ancestor to have a GI value of 1.48±0.13 (standard error of the mean [SEM]) (Table S3), which falls within the range of the observed threshold, we are left with an ambivalent evolutionary history for mammalian neocortical expansion: either (i) BPs capable of undergoing symmetric proliferative divisions are ancestral to all eutherian mammals and were selected against along multiple lineages (e.g., rodents, strepsirrhines), so that the ultimate loss of BP proliferative potential in certain taxa, and therefore the evolution of low-GI species, is the result of divergent developmental adaptations; or (ii) such symmetric proliferative BPs are not ancestral to eutherian mammals, but evolved convergently along multiple lineages, in which case the developmental process for their inclusion in neurogenic programming may be conserved, even if that process was unexpressed for long stretches of mammalian evolution.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have revealed an important insight into mammalian evolution: a GI threshold exists in mammalian brain evolution; neocortical expansion beyond that threshold requires a specific class of progenitor cell-type (BPs) to adopt a specific mode of cell division (symmetric proliferative); and the difference in neuron output between any species on the same side of that threshold does not appear to require adaptations to the lineage or mode of cell division during neurogenesis, but may simply reflect differences in the length of the neurogenic period. Further research into the conservation of genomic regions regulating the capacity of BPs to undergo symmetric proliferative divisions (e.g., through the establishment and maintenance of a proliferative niche in the SVZ) in low- versus high-GI species may reveal whether this mechanism for neocortical expansion has evolved independently in distantly related species or is the product of a deep homology in mammalian cortical development.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCalculating GI\n\nWe calculated GI using images of Nissl-stained coronal sections from http://brainmuseum.org. We used 10–22 sections, equally spaced along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain, for each species (Figure S1). The inner and outer contours of the left hemisphere were traced in Fiji (http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji). The species for which we calculated GI are indicated by an asterisk in Table S1. Additional GI values were collected from the literature (Table S1; Database S1). Several species (e.g., platypus), whose cortical folding has been described [42],[43] but not measured according to the method established by [44], could not be included in our primary reconstructions of GI evolution (Figure 1). However, these species, assumed to be lissencephalic (GI = 1.0), were included in supplemental analyses (Table S3; see Reconstructing the evolutionary history of GI).\n\nWork in humans and baboons has shown that interindividual variation in GI is not enough to outweigh interspecific differences [45],[46].\n\nReconstructing the Evolutionary History of GI\n\nVariation in the mode and tempo of a continuous character trait is not always best characterized by a random walk (i.e., Brownian motion). Therefore, we compared a range of evolutionary models on the phylogenetic distribution of GI to find the best fit for the data [47]–[50]. Log-likelihood scores for each model were tried against the random walk score using the cumulative distribution function of the χ2 distribution. Maximum-likelihood ancestral character states of GI and rate-shifts in the evolution of GI were then constructed using the best-fit model, with the standard error and confidence intervals calculated from root node reconstruction in PDAP using independent contrasts [51]–[53]. Although a number of putatively lissencephalic non-eutherians were unavailable for our analyses (see Calculating GI), we nonetheless reconstructed alternative ancestral GI values that included one hypothetical monotreme and three hypothetical marsupials (Table S3). The phylogeny used in this analysis was derived from a species-level supertree [26]. We appreciate that the phylogenetic hypothesis reconstructed by [54] gives notably deeper divergence dates for mammalian sub-classes; however, not enough of our sampled species were included in this reconstruction for it to be useful here.\n\nTo trace evolutionary changes in GI at individual nodes and along lineages, we used a two-rate mode that highlighted the differences in high (&gt;1) versus low (&lt;1) root-to-tip substitutions and then sampled rates based on posterior probabilities across the tree using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain. We assumed that transitioning between adjacent GI values had the highest likelihood of occurrence. The rate at a given node could then be compared to the rate at the subsequent node to determine if a rate transition was likely. We corroborated these results using the auteur package [55], which calculates rate-transitions at internal nodes under the assumption of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck selection model [34] over 1 million Monte Carlo sampling iterations drawn from random samplings of posterior distributions of lineage-specific rates.\n\nScaling relationships were determined for GI as a function of all continuous life-history and physiological traits, including adult cortical neuron counts. For three eulipotyphla species (Sorex fumeus, Blarina brevicauda, Scalopus aquaticus), data were available for neuron counts but not GI, and therefore we extrapolated the GI of those species on the basis of gross morphology. Finally, to test whether the bimodal distribution of GI may be influenced by the topology of the mammalian phylogenetic tree, we used an expectation-maximization algorithm. Each simulated trait was given the same variance as GI (Figure S5) and the result was averaged over 104 simulated datasets. None of the simulations produced the same bimodal distribution of species observed for GI data.\n\nStochastic Mapping of GI across the Mammalian Phylogeny\n\nWe used a comprehensive phylogenetic approach to map 37 life-history and physiological character traits collected from the literature (Tables S1 and S2) onto hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships in Mammalia, in order to examine how those traits correlate, over evolutionary time, with degree of gyrencephaly. Continuous character traits were discretized using the consensus of natural distribution breaks calculated with a Jenks-Caspall algorithm [56], model-based clustering according to the Schwarz criterion [57], and hierarchical clustering [58]. Character histories were then corrected for body mass with a phylogenetic size correction [59],[60] and summarized across the phylogeny using posterior probabilities. Associations between individual states of each character trait along those phylogenetic histories were calculated in SIMMAP (v1.5) using empirical priors based on the frequency of character states for each trait [61]; the association between any two states was a measure of the frequency of occurrence (i.e., the amount of branch length across the tree) of those states on the phylogeny. While correcting for body mass is intended to normalize the data, it cannot completely remove interdependencies between character traits. Although we cannot a priori assume that any of the traits interact, exploring interactions between them deserves further investigation.\n\nThe sums, rates, and types of changes for GI and body weight were plotted as mutational maps to assess directional biases in their evolution [62]–[64]. These were used to determine the evolutionary historical patterns of GI and, as a control, body weight. By estimating the occurrence (number of times an increase/decrease happens) and timing (where in the phylogeny the change occurs) of different values for each trait, we were able to calculate how often each trait has increased and decreased in mammalian evolution. We were therefore able to evaluate the ratio of increases over decreases for each trait (Figure S4).\n\nEstimating Neuroepithelial Founder Pool Populations\n\nWe estimated neuroepithelial founder pool populations for mouse and human. For the mouse, we used coronal sections of an E11.5 mouse embryo obtained from the Allen Brain Atlas [65]. We obtained 19 sections equidistantly spaced along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain. The length of the ventricular surface of the dorsal telencephalon was manually traced in Fiji [66] on each section starting from the point above the nascent hippocampus and ending in the point above the lateral ganglionic eminence. The horizontal length of the embryonic brain at E11.5 was measured with images from [67]. Using the coronal and horizontal measurements, we constructed a polygon representing the ventricular surface of the dorsal telencephalon and calculated the area of this surface in Fiji. We measured the surface area of the end-feet of neuroepithelial cells using EM images of the coronally cut apical surface of an E11.5 embryonic mouse brain (Table S6). The diameter of a single end-foot was calculated by measuring the distance between the adherens junctions. We corroborated these end-feet calculations with published immunofluorescence stainings of the apical complex (ZO1 and N-cadherin) from an en face perspective [68],[69]. The average surface area of a single end-foot was calculated by approximating the end-foot as a hexagon; and the number of founder cells was estimated by dividing the surface of the dorsal telencephalon by the surface of an individual end-foot of the neuroepithelial cell, such thatOur final mouse values were comparable to those previously published [70]. For the human, we followed the same procedure, using ten coronal sections and one horizontal section of a gestation week (GW) 9 brain [71]. End-feet were calculated using EM images of the apical surface of a human brain at GW13. The measurements are available in Table S6. Because the number of founder cells per surface area was nearly equivalent in mouse and human (4×105/mm2), we used this ratio, along with data on ventricular volume collected from the literature (Tables S1 and S2; Database S1), to estimate neuroepithelial founder cell populations for a further 15 species (Table 1). For species where no data on ventricular volume were available, values were estimated on the basis of a regression analysis against brain weight (Figure S6). Ventricular volume was then converted to surface area for each species by approximating the ventricle as a cylinder with a 4.5-to-1 height-to-diameter proportion (this ratio was estimated on the basis of observations in mouse). Ventricular volume-derived ventricular surface area estimates were corroborated with the surface areas calculated from the literature for mouse and human. Founder cell estimates were then computed on the basis of the densities derived above for mouse and human. Using this method, but alternately ignoring our mouse and human calculations to define the parameters, we were able to predict mouse and human values within 10% of our calculations, respectively.\n\nMathematical Modeling of Neurogenesis\n\nWorkers have demonstrated the occurrence of three primary lineages of neuron generation in mouse corticogenesis (Figure 5A, lineages 1–3) [1],[5],[14],[72] and a further four lineages in primate corticogenesis (Figure 5A, lineages 4–7) [9],[10]. While there is evidence for at least one additional lineage in mouse [6], and further lineages may be speculated, we limited our model to the seven that are considered to contribute most significantly to neuron output [2],[10],[73],[74]. The extent of neuron generation in each of these seven lineages was summarized in series and solved numerically (Figure 5B).\n\nNeurogenic period was either taken from the literature (Database S1) or estimated on the basis of a regression analysis of neurogenic period as a function of gestation period (Figure S6). Neurogenic period in human was estimated using empirical observations from the literature [75]–[77]. The averaged cell-cycle length for apical and BPs from the mouse (18.5 hours) [78]–[80] was used for all non-primates; averaged cell-cycle length for cortical areas 17 and 18 from the macaque (45 hours) was used for catarrhines [10],[81]; and an intermediary cell-cycle length (30 hours in marmoset, determined by EdU labeling; Ayako Murayama and Hideyuki Okano, personal communication), was used for platyrrhines. Using an average cell-cycle length value for all progenitor-types was found to be equally valid for predicting neuron number as using different cell-cycle lengths for each progenitor-type (Figure S12). Therefore, despite its potential shortcomings, using average cell-cycle length is a valid approach and, given the scarcity of species data on the cell-cycle length of various progenitor-types at different stages of neurogenesis, the best approach available to construct neurogenic models across many species. Generous confidence intervals (75%) for cell-cycle length are used in our models (Figure 5C), in order to show the minimal explanatory power cell-cycle length provides for interspecific differences in cortical neuron number.\n\nDiminishing numbers of neuroepithelial cells have been observed to continue to proliferate at the ventricle until E18.5 in the mouse [7]. Therefore, final neuroepithelial founder pool estimates were calculated from the aforementioned by evenly decreasing the value of n in the Sherley equation [82] from 1 at E9.5 to 0 at E18.5 in the mouse and at comparable neurogenic stages in other species.\n\nNeuron numbers were calculated for each species from combinations of lineages. The proportional contribution of each lineage for each species was parameterized according to existing data on progenitor cell-type abundances in mouse [14], marmoset [22], rabbit (IK and WBH, in preparation), macaque [10], and human [9],[11]. Where no such data were available, proportional contributions were permutated for all lineages until a best-fit estimate, based on cortical neuron numbers taken from the literature [33],[83]–[85], was achieved (Tables 1 and 2). Each lineage was assumed to occur from the first to final day of neurogenesis, although this is only approximately accurate. Finally, because of published estimates of postnatal apoptosis in the mammalian cortex [86]–[88], we assumed neuron counts to be 1.5-fold higher at the termination of neurogenesis than in the adult brain; therefore, neuron number at the termination of neurogenesis was estimated in each species by multiplying neuron numbers collected from the literature by 1.5. This multiplication is not represented in Table 1.\n\nCalculating the Effects of Proliferative Progenitors on Neuronal Output\n\nTrade-offs in adapting a human neurogenic program with either an expanding neuroepithelial founder pool or lengthening neurogenic period were tested for the mouse (Mus musculus) and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), two lissencephalic species whose cell-type proportions during neurogenesis have been documented [7],[14],[22].\n\nTo estimate the relative reproductive value and stable-stage proportions of each of the lineages in the mouse and human neurogenic programs, we constructed a stage-structured Lefkovitch matrix, using sums of the lineage series (after 100 cycles) as fecundity values and complete permutations of the proportional contributions of each lineage as mortality values. The altered growth-rates of each lineage were calculated by excluding lineages one at a time and assuming 100% survival in the remaining lineages (Table S5).\n\nWe introduced three ODEs to explore the average dynamics of asymmetric versus symmetric progenitors, such that: if a(t), b(t), and c(t) are the numbers of asymmetrically dividing cells, differentiated cells, and proliferative cells, respectively, then,where r is equal to growth-rate. If a(t) = a0, thenandUsing these ODEs, we calculated the effect on neuron output of increasing the likelihood of symmetrically dividing daughter progenitors in the lineage (Figure S9). The interdependent growth-rates in the model reflect a purely mechanistic interpretation of determining neuronal output from a finite pool of asymmetrically dividing cells. The ODEs, therefore, may not reflect differential regulation of neuronal output via direct versus indirect neurogenesis. The daughter proliferative cells are designed to carry out one round of proliferation followed by a final round of self-consumption (Figure S9).\n\nSupporting Information"
