  "fullText": "As concerns over pollution and climate change increase, understanding the impact of environmental change on living organisms is coming to the fore as never before. Research in the area of environmental genomics, through the application of genomic technologies, is shedding light on fundamental processes by which organisms evolve and adapt to both the biotic and abiotic aspects of their environments. Understanding how organisms perceive and react to changes in their environments also has many direct applications, for example, in the field of bioremediation.\n\nThe United Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has recently invested over £26 million in this area under the Environmental Genomics and Post-Genomics and Proteomics Science Programmes. As part of the Environmental Genomics initiative, NERC funded the creation of a dedicated bioinformatics centre with a remit to provide bioinformatics consultation, training, and data management.\n\nThe Environmental Genomics Thematic Programme Data Centre (EGTDC) was established in 2002 and works to develop and implement bioinformatics and data management solutions for environmental genomics researchers. The EGTDC team of bioinformaticians and data managers work together to develop a variety of open-source projects including Bio-Linux, a Linux computing platform customized for bioinformatics research, Partigene, an EST analysis pipeline, and Maxd, a transcriptomics software suite that specializes in aiding users in annotating experiments to MIAME standards. The EGTDC also presents courses on a range of topics, has developed an extensive set of Web-based documents, and aims to make all of the resources it develops available to the wider public.\n\nThe EGTDC is particularly interested in the use and development of data standards in this area and has developed an “ENV” extension to MIAME to capture information about microarray experiments relevant to environmental samples. This activity is now formally recognized by the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society.\n\nThrough the combined provisioning of computers, software, appropriate data standards, and bioinformatics consultation, the EGTDC aims to help researchers more easily collect, store, and interpret their genomic data (Figure 1). To maximize the collective value of this data, the EGTDC has recently developed a public data catalogue (Figure 2). Discovery-level metadata are stored along with accession numbers for data held in public databases (dbEST, ArrayExpress, EMBL, etc). Therefore, the data catalogue is a way for users to “spider out” to the digital datasets that may be held in primary public databases and in specialized databases generated by the environmental genomics research community, the EGTDC, or individual researchers. The catalogue currently holds information for 28 environmental genomic grants and a total of 314 data holdings of a variety of types, including “omic” data (genomics, arrays, and proteomics data), single nucleotide polymorphisms, microsatellites, genetic maps, libraries, publications, and other documents, such as protocols and phenotypic data. This catalogue can be searched by keyword, data type, and a variety of other fields and provides accession numbers that can be cited in publications or linked to (accessed) directly by URL. Anyone interested in submitting information on existing or future datasets can contact the EGTDC helpdesk at E-mail: helpdesk@envgen.nox.ac.uk.\n\nThe EGTDC is currently expanding its remit to include future support for proteomics and metabolomics data management and integration of solutions in a systems biology context, with funding from the NERC Post-Genomics and Proteomics Science Programme. The EGTDC is currently funded until early 2009 and hopes to continue, in collaboration with others, to improve the range of bioinformatics tools and databases available for researchers working in environmental genomics. Its vision for the future includes the ability to integrate its genomic holdings with biological and environmental datasets held across the NERC and beyond. The EGTDC expects to change its name to the NERC Environmental Bioinformatics Centre in the near future, but its main remit will remain the collection, curation, and management of genomic data of environmental relevance.\n\nMore information can be found on the EGTDC Web site at http://envgen.nox.ac.uk.",
