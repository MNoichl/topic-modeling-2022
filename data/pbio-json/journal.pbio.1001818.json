  "fullText": "In the legend for Figure 4, there is a misspelling. The correct spelling is: 50 µm. The authors have provided a corrected version here.\n\nFigure 5 is incorrect. Figure panel 5H was an inadvertent duplication of the figure panel 5G. Figures 5G and H show ELISA quantifications of extra- (EC) and intracellular (IC) S1P levels in 3T3 cells (G) and cerebellar granule neurons (H) before and after 30 and 60 min incubation with Nogo-A-Δ20. The authors have provided a corrected version here."
