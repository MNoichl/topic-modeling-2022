  "abstract": "Congenital nystagmus, involuntary oscillating small eye movements, is commonly thought to originate from aberrant interactions between brainstem nuclei and foveal cortical pathways. Here, we investigated whether nystagmus associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) results from primary deficits in the retina. We found that CSNB patients as well as an animal model (nob mice), both of which lacked functional nyctalopin protein (NYX, nyx) in ON bipolar cells (BCs) at their synapse with photoreceptors, showed oscillating eye movements at a frequency of 4–7 Hz. nob ON direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), which detect global motion and project to the accessory optic system (AOS), oscillated with the same frequency as their eyes. In the dark, individual ganglion cells (GCs) oscillated asynchronously, but their oscillations became synchronized by light stimulation. Likewise, both patient and nob mice oscillating eye movements were only present in the light when contrast was present. Retinal pharmacological and genetic manipulations that blocked nob GC oscillations also eliminated their oscillating eye movements, and retinal pharmacological manipulations that reduced the oscillation frequency of nob GCs also reduced the oscillation frequency of their eye movements. We conclude that, in nob mice, synchronized oscillations of retinal GCs, most likely the ON-DCGCs, cause nystagmus with properties similar to those associated with CSNB in humans. These results show that the nob mouse is the first animal model for a form of congenital nystagmus, paving the way for development of therapeutic strategies.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nCongenital nystagmus (i.e., involuntary repetitive uncontrolled eye movements) [1,2] forms a heterogeneous group of eye-movement disorders with eye movements ranging from sinusoidal-like oscillations (pendular nystagmus) to highly asymmetrical repetitive eye movements (jerk nystagmus). Many patients suffering from congenital nystagmus also have a low visual acuity, which limits the quality of life. Congenital nystagmus is commonly thought to originate from aberrant interactions between brainstem nuclei and foveal cortical pathways. However, decades of research has yet to uncover the underlying pathophysiological mechanism(s) of congenital nystagmus or its associated reduced vision.\n\nOur recent clinical research indicated that some types of congenital nystagmus may have a retinal origin [3]. We examined 11 infant boys aged 2 mo through 2 y who presented with a tonic downgaze of both eyes, a chin-up head posture, and a rapid horizontal congenital nystagmus. These infants also had congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), reduced visual acuity, and mutations in either nyctalopin (NYX) or the L-type voltage-gated Ca-channel subunit 1F (CACNA1F) genes [3]. These proteins are highly specific to the photoreceptor to ON bipolar cells (BCs) synapse. NYX is located postsynaptically on the ON-BC dendrites [4,5], whereas CACNA1F is expressed presynaptically at the photoreceptor synaptic terminal [6–9]. Mutations in either of these genes abolish ON-BC light responses [8–11].\n\nHere, we studied eye movements of nob mice, which lack nyx and are a well-established model for CSNB [7,8]. Strikingly, nob mice have a pendular nystagmus with a frequency similar to that found in young CSNB patients. Further analysis of retinal processing and eye movements shows that the oscillating eye movements are caused by a mechanism within the retina that induces synchronized oscillations in retinal ganglion cells (GCs), including the ON direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) that project to the accessory optic system (AOS). Our results show that this form of congenital nystagmus has a retinal origin.\n\nResults\n\nWe reanalyzed video material of a group of young children (3 mo–2 y) with a disconjugate small-amplitude horizontal pendular nystagmus in combination with tonic downgaze [3]. These patients had mutations in genes coding for proteins expressed at the synapse between photoreceptors and ON-BCs [3]. The oscillation frequency of their horizontal pendular nystagmus was 6.25 ± 0.63 Hz (n = 3) (S1 Fig &amp; S1 Movie). Because one of the patients carried a mutation in the NYX gene, we analyzed the eye movements of nob mice, which also lack functional NYX protein and are a well-established model of CSNB [7,8]. wt (wild-type) mice (Fig 1A, blue lines) followed a horizontally moving vertical sinusoidal grating (100% contrast, spatial frequency 0.1 cycles/deg, velocity: 10 deg/s) with smooth eye movements and kept their eyes fixated when the stimulus stopped (gray bars). In contrast, the nob littermates (red lines) initially followed the same horizontally moving vertical grating with smooth eye movements, but they could not maintain that movement, and they could not fixate their eyes when the grating stopped moving. Regardless of stimulus motion, they had spontaneous, small-amplitude oscillating horizontal eye movements (Fig 1A &amp; 1B). Power spectral density (PSD) plots show that nob eye-movement oscillation frequency was approximately 5 Hz, both during the stationary (Fig 1C, solid red lines) and the moving phases (Fig 1C, dashed red lines) of optokinetic stimulation, whereas wt eye movements during both stationary and moving phases had no such peak (Fig 1C, solid and dashed blue lines, respectively). On average, the oscillation frequency of nob eye movements to stationary gratings was 5.17 ± 0.18 Hz (n = 17) (Fig 1C, solid red line, S2A Fig).\n\nBy varying the spatial frequency and orientation of the stationary gratings, we determined that a vertical grating with a spatial frequency of 0.1 cycles/deg generated eye-movement oscillations with the strongest power (Fig 1D &amp; 1E, red). Darkness and horizontally oriented gratings failed to induce significant eye-movement oscillations (Fig 1D). Additionally, no vertical oscillating eye movements were detected (green).\n\nBecause the nyx mutation affects signaling by retinal ON-BCs [8–11], we asked whether nob mice show changes in their retinal output. We recorded activity from GC axons in the optic nerve (Fig 2A) and found that nob GCs showed oscillating burst-spiking behavior with a mean frequency of 4.79 ± 0.13 Hz (n = 46) (Fig 2B and S2A Fig), which did not differ significantly from the mean frequency of their eye-movement oscillations (Student t test, t = −1.53, df = 61, p = 0.13). These oscillations were absent in wt GCs (Fig 2A &amp; 2B). Because of the widespread oscillations across nob GCs, we hypothesized that the signaling of retinal image motion might be affected.\n\nThe direction of image motion is transmitted from the retina to the brain via two general pathways. ON-DSGCs, which are most sensitive to low temporal frequencies, low image velocities, and signal global motion project to the AOS [12–15] and are the primary neurons driving the optokinetic reflex [16]. In contrast, ON/OFF-DSGCs, which have a broad temporal frequency–response range, are mostly implicated in relative-motion detection and project mainly to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and superior colliculus (SC) [12–15]. To determine which of these two pathways is affected most in nob mice, we recorded the frequency-response curves of their eye movements induced by sinusoidally oscillating dot patterns with a constant peak velocity (Fig 1F). The frequency-response relation of nob (red symbols) and wt eye movements (blue symbols) differed, but only in the low frequency range, consistent with a malfunction in ON-DSGCs, suggesting that these GCs are predominantly involved in generating the nystagmus phenotype.\n\nTo test this idea, we recorded excitatory and inhibitory currents in nob ON-DSGCs, using nob mice crossed and backcrossed with SPARC-related protein-containing immunoglobulin domains 1 (SPIG1)+ reporter mice in which ON-DSGCs coding for upward image motion are green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled [17,18]. In contrast to wt ON-DSGCs, nob GFP+ ON-DSGCs were visually nonresponsive, and both their excitatory and inhibitory currents oscillated with a mean frequency of 5.10 ± 0.22 Hz (n = 36) and 4.50 ± 0.38 Hz (n = 8), respectively (Fig 2C &amp; 2D). The oscillation frequencies of nob eye movements, GC burst-spiking, and ON-DSGC excitatory and inhibitory currents did not differ significantly from each other (ANOVA: F = 1.320, df = 103, p = 0.272), indicating that a retinal oscillator, presynaptic to nob GCs, drives these oscillations (S2A Fig).\n\nUsing a multielectrode array (MEA), we recorded the activity of nob GCs extracellularly and assessed their light-evoked responses and oscillatory activity. nob ON-DGCs do not respond to light stimuli, and this makes it impossible to identify these neurons in MEA recordings. In the dark, about 55% (602 GCs; 10 retinas) of the nob GCs showed periodic variations in their autocorrelations (Fig 3A), indicating that they oscillated. We never observed such oscillations in wt GCs in either the dark or after a light flash (Fig 3Biv). To examine whether nob GCs oscillated synchronously, we selected nine oscillating nob GCs and, in the dark, aligned the activity of GC-2 through GC-9 such that their first spike in each of one hundred 2-s periods, spaced 3 s apart, corresponded with the first spike fired by GC-1 during the same period. The aligned traces were averaged (Fig 3Bi), and the averaged traces show that the spike patterns of GC-2 through GC-9 are unrelated to GC-1, indicating that their rhythmic firing differed in frequency and phase from the oscillations of GC-1. We also observed that the oscillations in the mean response of GC-1 reduced over time, suggesting that the frequency and phase of the spontaneous GC oscillations varied slowly over time. In contrast, a brief light flash synchronized oscillatory activity across all nine GCs (Fig 3Bii). In the light, their averaged traces of 100 repetitions showed clear oscillation patterns, indicating that light stimulation acted to phase-reset their activity and produced synchronized oscillations.\n\nWe found two clusters of nob GCs that oscillated in antiphase (Fig 3Biii). In one cluster, nob GCs responded initially to the light flash with a reduction in firing rate, identifying them as OFF-GCs. In the other cluster, GCs’ mean firing rates remained unchanged during and after a light stimulation, suggesting they were ON-GCs, since all nob ON-GCs are visually unresponsive. During the light flash, the oscillatory activity of nob GCs synchronized within each cluster, as revealed by their short-time cross-correlations (Fig 3C). Both ON-GC/ON-GC and OFF-GC/OFF-GC pairs showed multipeak correlograms with a positive coefficient around zero lag time after light onset, indicating synchronized oscillatory firing. An ON-GC paired with an OFF-GC showed a similar multipeak correlogram but now had a negative correlation coefficient around zero lag time. This indicates that ON-GCs and OFF-GCs oscillate in antiphase. Fig 3D shows the mean cross-correlations for all ON-GC/ON-GC and OFF-GC/OFF-GC pairs and all the ON-GCs paired with all the OFF-GCs, before (blue) and during (red) the light flash. This behavior was found in all four retinas tested.\n\nIn the next series of experiments, we sought to establish a causal relationship between eye movements and GC oscillations in nob mice. First, we pharmacologically blocked or modified the excitatory inputs to the GCs and measured both GC oscillations and eye-movement oscillations. Blocking excitatory α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inputs in vitro with a cocktail of 50 μM 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) (50 μM 6, 7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione [DNQX]) and 10 μM D(−)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5) eliminated all nob GC oscillations (Fig 4Ai-iii). Similarly, intraocular injections of a similar cocktail in vivo eliminated eye-movement oscillations in awake and behaving mice (Fig 4Aiv). This shows that the eye-movement oscillations depend on retinal activity.\n\nAs functionally diverse GCs display oscillatory firing in nob mice (Fig 3B) [10], these oscillations presumably arise from a common presynaptic source. As we find two groups of nob GCs oscillating in antiphase (Fig 3B–3D), the AII amacrine cells (ACs) are a likely candidate for this presynaptic source, as they drive both ON- and OFF-GCs with opposite sign [19]. In mice with photoreceptor degeneration (retinal degeneration 1 [rd1] mouse), AII ACs generate intrinsic oscillations [20] that drive oscillatory firing of ON- and OFF-GCs in antiphase [21]. In these rd1 mice, the oscillation frequency of AII ACs can be decreased by blocking glycine receptors with the antagonist strychnine (STR) [20]. Similarly, in nob retina, application of 10 μM STR reduced both ON-DSGC oscillation frequency (control: 4.25 ± 0.12 Hz; STR: 2.67 ± 0.07; n = 6; paired Student t test, t = 5.27, df = 5, p = 0.003) (Fig 4Bi—iii) and the eye-movement oscillation frequency (control: 5.55 ± 0.05 Hz; STR: 2.83 ± 0.63; n = 3; paired Student t test, t = 7.30, df = 2, p = 0.018) (Fig 4Biv). Although 1 μM of STR already induced a reduction of the GC oscillation frequency of 0.92 ± 0.23 Hz (n = 3; p = 0.022), we used a higher concentration to induce a large and robust shift in oscillation frequency. This dose may have induced an additional block of GABA receptors as well. We used linopiridine hydrochloride (LP) to block the M-type potassium current [20] essential for the AII AC oscillations [22–24]. LP (30 μM) decreased the oscillation frequency of the ON-DSGCs from 5.71 ± 0.53 to 2.83 ± 0.40 Hz (n = 6; paired Student t test, t = 7.45, df = 5, p = 0.0007) and decreased the eye-movement oscillation frequency from 5.00 ± 0.00 to 1.75 ± 0.50 Hz (n = 3; paired Student t test, t = 6.48, df = 2, p = 0.023) (Fig 4C).\n\nFinally, we disrupted the gap-junction coupling between the ON-BCs and the AII AC network [25–27]. In rd1 mice, the gap-junction blocker meclofenamic acid (MFA) blocks the oscillations of the AII ACs [21,28]. MFA (100 μM) blocked the oscillation in GCs (Fig 4Di-iii) in nob mice, corroborating the evidence for AII ACs being the source of the oscillations. As the gap junctions themselves are composed of connexin 36 (Cx36), we crossed Cx36 knockout mice and nob mice. In these nob mice lacking Cx36, both the GC oscillations and the eye-movement oscillations were absent (Fig 4D).\n\nFor extended statistics of these pharmacological experiments, see S2B Fig. Together, the results of Fig 4 indicate that (1) the oscillator driving the oscillating eye movements is located in the retina, (2) the AII ACs are critically involved in generating the oscillations in nob GCs, and (3) there is a causal relation between the nob GC oscillations and their eye-movement oscillations.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study reveals—for the first time, to our knowledge—a pathophysiological mechanism for a specific form of congenital nystagmus and shows that its origin is retinal. We propose the following mechanism (Fig 5A &amp; S3 Fig). In wt mice, ON-DSGCs, which are sensitive to low-velocity global image motion, respond coherently when an image moves across the retina. Their coherent output reflects the direction and speed of global image movement: i.e., the retinal slip signal. This signal forms the input to the AOS, where it induces compensatory eye movements that stabilize the image on the retina. In nob mice, the network behaves quite differently. nob ON-DSGCs are nonresponsive to light stimuli and thus cannot detect image motion, which may underlie the lack of a well-developed optokinetic response (OKR). In addition, nob GCs oscillate spontaneously, which, as shown in this paper, induces a pendular nystagmus.\n\nWe propose that the origin of these oscillations is the AII ACs for the following reasons. Firstly, the source of the oscillations is presynaptic to GCs. Secondly, AII ACs contain an intrinsic, membrane-potential dependent oscillator, consisting of a fast sodium channel, and both a fast and a slow (M-type) potassium channel [20]. When the AII AC membrane potential is outside its normal working range because of altered input from the ON-BCs, the AII ACs start to oscillate [20]. Finally, the oscillations of ON- and OFF-GCs are driven in antiphase, which AII ACs will do, since they drive ON- and OFF-GCs with opposite sign.\n\nHow could light stimulation synchronize the oscillations in the GCs? Since the oscillator in AII ACs is an intrinsic feature of the AII ACs, they could oscillate rather independently of each other, leading to asynchronous GC oscillations, as we find in the dark. We hypothesize that global light stimulation depolarizes the membrane potential of the AII ACs by crossover inhibition driven by GABAergic OFF ACs [29]. This will phase-reset and synchronize the AII ACs and subsequently synchronize in antiphase both the ON- and OFF-GCs they project to.\n\nThe consequence is that despite the absence of a classical visually evoked response in nob ON-DSGCs, their oscillations synchronize when the retina is stimulated with a global light stimulus. The combined activity of the synchronized oscillating nob ON-DSGCs is interpreted in the AOS as an oscillating retinal slip signal, and, in response, oscillating compensatory eye movements are generated: pendular nystagmus. On the other hand, when the oscillations of nob ON-DSGCs are asynchronous, such as in the dark, the integrated output to the AOS will not oscillate and will not evoke a pendular nystagmus.\n\nOnce initiated, oscillating eye movements over an image induce retinal activity that phase resets the retinal oscillator (AII ACs) and maintains the synchronous oscillations of ON-DSGCs and pendular nystagmus (Fig 5A). This represents a self-maintaining loop. Consistent with this idea, a horizontally oriented grating fails to induce oscillating eye movements, because horizontal eye movements over a horizontal grating appears as a stationary stimulus to GCs (Fig 5B). This will not modulate retinal activity and will not synchronize GC oscillations, and pendular nystagmus is absent (Fig 1D).\n\nAlthough we suggested that the ON-DSGCs drive the oscillating eye movements, we cannot exclude contribution of other GCs. However, ON-DSGCs are the most important GCs to detect the direction of global retinal image motion that is used as a retinal slip signal by the AOS to induce compensatory eye movements [16]. Oscillations in these cells will therefore be especially effective in inducing oscillating eye movements.\n\nThe suggestion that AII ACs are the source of the oscillations implies that all ON-DSGCs oscillate. If this is the case, why is nystagmus in the CSNB patients and nob mice only horizontal when ON-DSGCs are tuned for image movement in three directions: naso-temporal, upward, and downward [14]? One of the simplest explanation is that the retinal slip signals generated by synchronously oscillating ON-DSGCs tuned for upward and downward motion cancel each other. This can occur, for instance, at the neuronal level of the vestibular oculomotor nuclei or possibly even at the level of the eye muscles. In contrast, the naso-temporal signal is not canceled, as there is no, or only a few, opposing ON-DSGCs [14].\n\nIn the present paper, we discuss the origin of a specific form congenital nystagmus, i.e., spontaneous small-amplitude involuntary oscillating eye movements. This pathological condition is distinct from the OKR, in which the eyes follow the global movement of the stimulus followed by a fast reset saccade. The OKR, sometimes referred to as optokinetic nystagmus, is often reduced or absent in nystagmus patients. However, the conclusion that congenital nystagmus arises as a consequence of a mere absence of the OKR is unwarranted, since, for example, mice with mutations in FERM domain-containing protein 7 (FRMD7) [30] have no horizontal OKR but do not develop a pathological nystagmus.\n\nIt has been suggested that congenital nystagmus originates from a disruption in the interaction of the subcortical optokinetic pathways (AOS) and cortical foveal pursuit system [1]. However, our findings show that the cause of congenital nystagmus associated with CSNB lies within the retina in the afoveate mouse. Since the optokinetic systems of afoveate and foveate animals differ, generalizing our findings in nob mice to humans with CSNB requires caution. That said, given the balance of our results, we proposed that the nob mouse model is relevant to human CSNB patients for the following reasons. Firstly, the nystagmus in young CSNB patients (S1 Fig) and nob mice is identical (Fig 1). Secondly, the photoreceptor to ON-BC synapse is highly conserved across mammals and even across vertebrates [31]. Thirdly, mutations in proteins specific for this synapse lead to the same CSNB phenotype in mice and humans [32], suggesting similar underlying retinal mechanisms. Fourthly, starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which are fundamental for generating direction-selective responses of GCs [30] and DSGCs [33], are found both in mouse and primate retina [34]. Finally, retrograde tracing experiments reveal retinal projections to the AOS in both mice and primates [35].\n\nFrom a therapeutic point of view, our results suggest that the primary pathogenic condition in patients with this form of congenital nystagmus occurs in the retina in the form of synchronized oscillations of GCs. Therapeutic interventions aimed at desynchronization of the oscillating GCs in the retina may serve to reduce or eliminate the nystagmus.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nAnimals\n\nAll animal experiments were carried out under the responsibility of the ethical committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), acting in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 22 July, 2003 (2003/65/CE), or the University of Louisville Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments we conducted under license number AVD-801002016517, issued by the Central Comity Animal Experiments of the Netherlands, and under the license number 17763, issued by the University of Louisville Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nwt mice, Mus musculus, were obtained from Janvier labs. Nob and Cx36 knockout mice were obtained from the McCall lab (University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States), and SPIG1+ mice were obtained from the Noda lab (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). Nob/Spig1+ and Cx36 knockout mice were crossbred to accomplish a double knockout with labeled ON-DSGCs. Since the nob mutation is X-linked, only male animals were used. For wt SPIG1+, both male and female animals were used. All mice were kept in a C75BL/JRj background. The age of the animals ranged from 4 wk to 1 y.\n\nEye-movement recordings\n\nSurgical preparation\n\nPrior to the start of experiments, adult animals were equipped with a head-fixation pedestal, an aluminum bit with an integrated magnet, attached to the parietal bones of the skull using dental cement (Super Bond, Sun Medical). Surgery was performed under general isoflurane/O2 anesthesia and topical anesthesia (bupivacaine). Analgesia was offered by subcutaneous injection of metacam (2 mg/kg). The recovery time was at least 2 d after pedestal surgery. During experiments, the animal was placed head-fixed in the experimental setup using a custom-made adapter, which allowed panoramic vision.\n\nOptokinetic stimulator\n\nFor the optokinetic experiments, two experimental setups were used. In the first system, a modified Marquee 9500 CRT projector (100 fps) generated a large panoramic visual surround (545 nm) onto three large back-projection screens (1.47 × 1.18 m; Stewart Filmscreen) that were placed around the animal to create a combined field of view of 270° × 77.5°. The average luminance of the visual stimulus was 10 cd/m2. Mickelson contrast of the grating stimuli was about 90%. In the second setup, two Benq XL2420t high-performance monitors (120 fps, gamma-1.745) were placed in V-formation around the animal, and the closest distance between the screen surface and the mouse head was 16.5 cm. Screen dimensions were 56.9 × 33.8 cm (combined field of view: 240° × 50°). Mickelson contrast of the grayscale grating stimuli approached 100%. The average luminance of the sine grating stimuli was 71.6 cd/m2. For measurements in darkness, the displays were switched off. Visual stimuli consisted of sine wave gratings, homogeneous grayscale images, and dotted patterns (dot radius 1°, center-to-center distance 5.35°). All stimulus patterns were computer generated and corrected for perspective distortion by projection onto a virtual sphere centered on the animal’s head.\n\nEye-movement recordings\n\nEye movements were recorded using an infrared video tracking system (JAI RM-6740CL monochrome CCD camera, 200 fps). In a few instances (Fig 1A–1C), pilocarpine (2%) eye drops were used to reduce pupil dilatation. A 2D eye position was computed from the relative distance between pupil center and corneal reflections of the infrared LEDs [36] and pupil size [37,38]. Epochs containing saccades, eye blinks, and motion artifacts were excluded from analysis. Eye velocity was smoothed using a Gaussian smoothing kernel with a SD of 7.5 ms (25-Hz cutoff). For monocular visual stimulation (Figs 1D, 3Aiv, 3Biv and 3Ciii), a miniature blackout cap was placed over the contralateral eye.\n\nIntraocular injections\n\nIntravitreal injections were administered under brief isoflurane/O2 sedation and topical anesthesia applied to the injection spot (0.4% oxybuprocaine). The eye movements were measured after the mouse recovered completely from the anesthesia. We used injection volumes ranging between 1 and 3 μL. To block AMPA receptors, we used either DNQX (Tocris, 50 μM final concentration) or CNQX (Tocris, 50 μM final concentration). CNQX and DNQX were assumed to act equally. To block NMDA receptors, we used D-AP5 (Tocris, 10 μM final concentration). To block glycinergic inhibition, we used STR (about 10 μM final concentration). The high dose of STR might have blocked GABA receptors as well. To block the M-type K current, we used LP (Tocris, 30 μM final concentration). Drugs were dissolved in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nAnalysis of eye-movement recordings\n\nPSDs were computed from angular eye velocity using Welch’s method with a 4-s window length, 75% overlap between windows, and a Hann window function. The fundamental frequency was computed by weighted averaging the frequencies with a magnitude &gt; 90% of the maximum power in the PSD. For comparisons between different stimulus conditions in nob mice, PSDs were normalized to the average power ≤ 2 Hz.\n\nIn vivo optic nerve recordings\n\nSurgical preparation\n\nAll surgical procedures were performed at light-adapted levels and have been published previously [39,40]. Briefly, anesthesia was induced with an intraperitoneal injection of a Ringer’s solution containing ketamine and xylazine (127 and 12 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with supplemental subcutaneous injections (about every 45 min) of anesthetic at 50% of initial concentration. The head was secured in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), a craniotomy was performed, and the overlying cortex was removed to expose the optic nerve. Throughout the experiment, body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a feedback-controlled heating pad (TC-1000; CWE, Ardmore, PA, USA). Topical phenylephrine hydrochloride (2.5%) and tropicamide (1%) ophthalmic solutions were applied to dilate the pupils and paralyze accommodation. Clear zero-powered lenses [41] moistened with artificial tears kept the cornea from drying. At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic followed by cervical dislocation.\n\nExtracellular GC axon recordings\n\nAction potentials were recorded extracellularly from single optic nerve axons using sharpened tungsten microelectrodes (impedance = 30–100 MΩ). A reference electrode was inserted subcutaneously. Action potentials from single GC axons were isolated, amplified (X3+Cell; FHC, Bowdoinham, ME, USA), digitized at 15 kHz (Power1401, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and stored for offline analysis. Isolated spike trains were simultaneously displayed on an oscilloscope and computer monitor and played over an audio monitor to obtain direct feedback of the cell’s response to visual stimuli. Responses were analyzed offline using Spike2 software v4.24 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Spikes were accumulated within a 50-ms bin width and displayed as poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs). Each average PSTH was smoothed by fitting it with a raised cosine function with a 50-ms smoothing interval to minimize alteration of the peak firing rate and maximize signal-to-noise ratio [39].\n\nRecording and analysis of GC spontaneous activity\n\nSpontaneous activity was determined for GCs in the dark over durations up to 200 s. The presence of a rhythmic component in the spontaneous activity was assessed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) that produced a power spectrum (Spike2 4.24; Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). A peak fundamental frequency was considered significant if its power was three standard errors (SEs) above the mean power between 0.5 and 30 Hz [42]. To estimate the consistency of the rhythmic activity, the recorded spontaneous activity was divided into segments of 20 s, and FFTs were performed on each segment to identify the fundamental peak. The mean fundamental frequency and its SE were computed across all segments.\n\nMEA recordings of GCs\n\nMice were dark-adapted for at least 1 h, euthanized with a mixture of CO2/O2, and cervically dislocated. Under dim red light, the eyes were removed and placed in oxygenated Ames medium. The eyecup was prepared by removing the cornea, lens, and as much vitreous humor as possible. Using a fine forceps, the retina was carefully dissected away from the sclera. Small incisions were made to flat-mount the retina. Regardless of whether the isolated retinas were used in the MEA recordings or for whole-cell patch clamp recordings, they were continuously superfused with Ames’ medium or Ringer’s solution and gassed with a mixture of O2 and CO2 at pH of 7.4 and 29–36°C.\n\nRecording of MEA data\n\nIsolated retinas were placed photoreceptor side up on a perforated 60 electrode array (60pMEA200/30iR-Ti using a MEA2100 system: Multichannel systems, Reutlingen, Germany) in a recording chamber mounted on an Nikon Optiphot-2 upright microscope and viewed under IR with an Olympus 2x objective and video camera (Abus TVCC 20530). Extracellular multiunit GC activity was recorded at 25 kHz in MC rack (Multichannel systems, Reutlingen, Germany), zero-phase bandpass filtered (250–6,250 Hz) with a fourth-order Butterworth filter in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and sorted into single-unit activity with “offline spike sorter” (Plexon, Dallas, TX, USA). Spikes were detected using an amplitude threshold &gt; 4σn where σn is an estimation of the background noise\n\nwith x being the bandpass-filtered signal [43]. The detected spikes were manually sorted into single units based on principal component or amplitude variables versus time. The clustering versus time approach allowed us to track changes in extracted features of single units occurring over extended recording periods and with differing firing rates.\n\nOptical stimulator\n\nLight stimuli were generated with Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 [38]. Stimuli were projected onto the retina from the photoreceptor side by a DLP projector (Light Crafter 4500, Wintech, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a custom-built 2x water immersion objective. One pixel of the DLP projector had a size on the retinal surface of 2.1 μm. Only white light stimuli were used. The “dark” light intensity was 6 μW/m2, and the maximal “light” intensity was 176.2 μW/m2.\n\nAnalysis of MEA data\n\nFor MEA recordings, rhythmic components in the spontaneous activity were assessed using single-unit activity during 600 s of darkness. Spike trains were binned into 1-ms intervals and then divided into 5-s nonoverlapping periods. Each segment was baseline subtracted, and the PSD and autocorrelation were evaluated over 120 segments, which were then averaged. The autocorrelations were normalized such that they were equal to 1 at zero lag. PSD was estimated by Welch’s modified periodogram using 4-s windows, with 75% overlap, multiplied by a Hamming window function, and a 4-s discrete Fourier transform length.\n\nSynchronized firing between units was assessed by cross-correlation after stimulation with a full field light stimulus presented for 500 ms. The flash was preceded and followed by a 500- and 1,000-ms period of darkness. Individual-unit spike trains were binned into 5-ms interval, and the response to 100 repetitions was averaged. The mean responses were divided into 250-ms windows, detrended, and then cross-correlated. For short-time cross-correlations, a 250-ms window was used that advanced in 25-ms steps.\n\nVoltage-clamp recordings of GCs\n\nWhole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed from GFP-labeled GCs in retinas mounted (GC side up) in a recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA). The recording chamber was mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E2000FN microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and viewed with a Nikon 60x water immersion objective with infrared differential interference contrast and a video camera (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). The GFP-labeled cells were identified using a short flash of 450–490 nm light.\n\nSolutions\n\nAmes’ medium supplemented with 1.9 g/L of NaHCO3 was used as the external bath solution, and whole-cell patch pipette solution contained [mM] 112 Cs-Methanesulfonate, 8 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 ATP-Mg, and 0.3 GTP-Na3, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, ECl = −69.92 mV, except for data shown in Fig 4Aiii. Here, we used a bicarbonate buffered Ringer’s bath solution containing [mM] 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 20 glucose, 26 NaHCO3, and 2 CaCl2 and a whole-cell patch pipette solution containing [mM] 120 Cs-gluconate, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Na-HEPES, 11 EGTA, 4 ATP and 1 GTP, and 1% LY. In these experiments, freshly prepared CNQX (Tocris) or DNQX (Tocris), D-AP5 (Tocris), and STR were added to the bath solution to block AMPA, NMDA, and glycine receptors, respectively. CNQX and DQNX were assumed to act equally. A cocktail of 50 μM DNQX and 10 μM D-AP5 in the external bath solution was prepared freshly before the experiment. For the dose-response curve of STR, the following concentrations were used: 1, 10, 20, 50 and 100 μM STR. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise indicated.\n\nOptical stimulator\n\nLight stimuli were generated with Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 [38]. Light stimuli were projected onto the retina from the photoreceptor side by an Acer C20 picoprojector via the microscope condenser. One pixel of the projector had a width of 4.8 μm on the retinal surface. The “dark” light intensity was 0.3 cd/m2, and the maximal “light” intensity was 450 cd/m2.\n\nRecording equipment\n\nWhole-cell data were recorded with a HEKA EPC10 patch clamp amplifier using PatchMaster software. The data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz with a four-pole Bessel low-pass filter. In a second setup, data were collected with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier using Digidata 1322A digitizer (MDS Analytical Technologies, Union City, CA, USA) and Clampex 10.2 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Union City, CA, USA) to generate command outputs, trigger the light stimulus, and acquire and analyze analog whole-cell voltages. These data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2.4 kHz with a four-pole Bessel low-pass filter. Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and Igor.pro (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, USA) were used to analyze the data.\n\nStatistics\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using Origin Pro 8 (Northampton, MA, USA) or Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). All mean values are presented ± SEM. Statistical significance was tested using a (paired) Student t test or a one-way ANOVA. Normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The distribution of the frequencies of the eye movements (df = 17, p = 0.28), the GCs optic nerve recordings (df = 46, p = 0.71), and the GC excitatory currents (df = 38, p = 0.26) were normally distributed. Differences with p &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nSupporting information"
