  "abstract": "Aiming at the design of an allosteric modulator of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)–Immunoglobulin G (IgG) interaction, we developed a new methodology including NMR fragment screening, X-ray crystallography, and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR at 100 kHz after sedimentation, exploiting very fast spinning of the nondeuterated soluble 42 kDa receptor construct to obtain resolved proton-detected 2D and 3D NMR spectra. FcRn plays a crucial role in regulation of IgG and serum albumin catabolism. It is a clinically validated drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases caused by pathogenic antibodies via the inhibition of its interaction with IgG. We herein present the discovery of a small molecule that binds into a conserved cavity of the heterodimeric, extracellular domain composed of an α-chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) (FcRnECD, 373 residues). X-ray crystallography was used alongside NMR at 100 kHz MAS with sedimented soluble protein to explore possibilities for refining the compound as an allosteric modulator. Proton-detected MAS NMR experiments on fully protonated [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD yielded ligand-induced chemical-shift perturbations (CSPs) for residues in the binding pocket and allosteric changes close to the interface of the two receptor heterodimers present in the asymmetric unit as well as potentially in the albumin interaction site. X-ray structures with and without ligand suggest the need for an optimized ligand to displace the α-chain with respect to β2m, both of which participate in the FcRnECD–IgG interaction site. Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nIn order to discover new chemical drugs, fragment screening followed by structure-based design is an efficient way to sample chemical space and find hits for challenging target classes such as protein-protein interactions [1–3]. In addition to discovering orthosteric ligands, fragment screening has the potential to locate secondary binding sites on a protein that may be exploited for allosteric regulation [4]. In the development process, a methodology that includes detection of allosteric effects is highly welcome. Magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR has the potential to contribute via the detection of long-range chemical-shift changes when the investigated protein is too large for solution-state NMR and can even not be deuterated. It is applied here to a soluble 42 kDa construct of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) within a search for allosteric regulators, employing very fast MAS (100 kHz).\n\nFcRn facilitates new-born humoral immunity by regulating Immunoglobulin (IgG) transport across the epithelium [5]. In addition, it has been shown to bind to IgG and Human Serum Albumin (HSA) at nonoverlapping sites in a pH-dependent manner (Fig 1) [6,7]. This allows maintenance of IgG and HSA homeostasis, accounting for the long serum half-life of both proteins [8–11]. At low pH, the interaction of FcRn with IgG occurs through protonation of ionizable residues, located at the CH2–CH3 hinge of the IgG Fc, which produces transient, intermolecular salt bridges with negatively charged residues on FcRn [12]. The interaction of FcRn with IgG and HSA occurs in acidified early endosomes, diverting the proteins from catabolism and carrying them back to the neutral pH environment of the extracellular compartment. At near-neutral pH, the affinity of the interaction decreases, and the complex dissociates [10,13].\n\nExisting as a heterodimer composed of β2-microglobulin (β2m) and a membrane-anchored α-chain (Fig 1), FcRn is homologous to the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC1) [14]. MHC1 presents antigenic peptide fragments to the T cell receptor (TCR) in complex with cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) [14]. In contrast, FcRn is not involved in endogenous peptide presentation to the TCR; its peptide-binding groove is closed and nonfunctional [14].\n\nThe effect of FcRn loss has been studied using β2m-deficient mice, which develop normally but are defective in T cell–mediated cytotoxicity [15]. Deletion of β2m precluded FcRn expression, resulting in a reduction in IgG half-life [16–18]. Additionally, random mutation of residues proximal to the IgG–FcRn binding site allowed selection of Fc variants with increased affinity for FcRn at pH 6. These Fc constructs maintained pH-dependent binding and showed an extended half-life relative to wild-type IgG [19].\n\nFcRn has been proposed as a drug target in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, in which pathogenic autoantibodies are detrimental to health [20]. Examples of such diseases include, but are not restricted to, myasthenia gravis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and dermatomyositis [21–24]. Antibodies produced against the FcRn heavy chain ameliorated myasthenia gravis symptoms in rats, and it has been shown that mice without FcRn are resistant to autoimmune disease [25–27]. The current treatment for these conditions is intravenous application of immunoglobulin, which increases the turnover of pathogenic IgG by saturating FcRn [26]. Recently, rozanolixizumab, an antihuman FcRn monoclonal antibody, reduced the serum IgG concentration in a randomized phase 1 study, providing clinical evidence for the potential of an anti-FcRn therapeutic [28].\n\nA chemical inhibitor to control FcRn trafficking is therapeutically desirable for potential treatment of autoimmune disorders. Orthosteric peptide inhibitors with in vivo efficacy have previously been reported [29–33]. Additionally, structure–activity relationships of small molecule antagonists using ELISA assays have also been described [34]. However, to date, no allosteric modulators of FcRn–IgG or FcRn–HSA interactions have been reported. Should such molecules be found, they could be used therapeutically or as tools in biomedical investigations.\n\nIn this study, we present the discovery of a compound that binds to the soluble extracellular domain of FcRn, abbreviated here as FcRnECD. In the initial screening process, complementary in silico methods were used to predict binding sites on the basis of charge and topography or sequence conservation, alone and in combination [35–37]. The interaction of the ligand with FcRnECD is investigated by a combination of X-ray crystallography and proton-detected, ultrafast MAS NMR, revealing its localization in an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket. At high MAS frequencies of 100 kHz, we could acquire well-resolved proton-detected NMR spectra on sedimented, fully protonated FcRnECD, allowing de-novo chemical-shift assignments of residues in the binding pocket and in β2m through establishing sequential connections. MAS NMR pinpoints chemical-shift changes upon ligand binding close to the binding site and in regions distant to it. In this context, MAS NMR helps to exclude the influence of crystal packing effects by making use of protein solutions. Both crystal structures with and without ligand were available, but structural changes were not obvious when using global fitting procedures, with the molecules possibly “locked” into a conformation by crystal contacts. To identify sections of the structure not affected by ligand binding for a fit that is also sensitive to small allosteric effects, residues that did not show chemical-shift changes were used to produce “chemical-shift–informed” overlays of FcRnECD X-ray structures with and without ligand. Our findings suggest that therapeutic intervention in autoimmune diseases may be achieved through allosteric small molecules that bind to FcRnECD. In addition, such compounds could potentially be used as chemical probes to study FcRn trafficking. The presented approach highlights further the use of MAS NMR for detecting structural changes in nondeuterated proteins expressed in mammalian cells upon ligand binding.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nX-ray crystallography of FcRnECD and ligandability assessments\n\nSmall molecule binding sites on proteins can be identified based on surface shape, charge, and functionality. We used SiteMap software to identify binding sites on the FcRnECD [35]. To obtain structural data for our analysis, diffraction data for FcRnECD crystals, at pH 3 and pH 8.5, were collected at cryogenic temperatures and structures solved to 2.0 Å and 2.45 Å, respectively, by molecular replacement. Two copies of FcRnECD were found in the asymmetric unit. In addition to the structures at acidic and basic pH, a pH 7.2 structure was generated using molecular dynamics simulation (S1 Fig and S1 Text).\n\nThe SiteMap software detected a number of regions with a druggability score &gt;1.0, a nominal quantifier indicating that nM binding might be achieved with a conventional small molecule of &lt;500 Da molecular weight. In particular, SiteMap identified a ligandable site at the interface between the α-chain and β2m (S1 Fig and S1 Text). The respective boundaries were predicted to vary with pH, with the area described as either one large or three distinct cavities.\n\nNo regions near the IgG binding site were found by SiteMap. Based on our analysis, should an orthosteric pocket for an IgG blocking small molecule exist, it is likely to be transient in nature and not stabilized in the crystal lattice.\n\nEvolutionary conservation of FcRnECD\n\nOn the premise that evolutionarily conserved cavities may have an associated function, we evaluated such conservation of the cavities found by SiteMap (S2 Fig). We identified ortholog sequences using OrthoDB and performed sequence alignments using Clustal Omega [38,39]. A homology model was then created for each sequence using MEDELLER that enabled us to visualize mutations according to the evolutionary conservation in PyMOL [40,41].\n\nOur sequence analysis broadly supports the notion that regions of the protein important for structural integrity or function are conserved, in particular the interface between the α-chain and β2m. It contains key contacts, such as those between D53β2m, Q34α-chain, and S37α-chain, and conservation of these contacts preserves the structural integrity of the noncovalently linked heterodimer.\n\nAdditionally, motifs within the HSA binding site were also conserved. One of them has previously been identified as being critical for albumin binding and was the site of a protein contact in our pH 3 and pH 8.5 crystal structures, between the two copies of FcRnECD in the asymmetric unit [8]. We were initially surprised to see the IgG binding site is poorly conserved with the exception of key residues, such as D130α-chain. This may be attributed to the heterogeneity in Fc moieties between mammalian orthologues, which presumably reduces species’ cross-reactivity. Of the regions identified by SiteMap, the central cavity was highly conserved, potentially due to the proximity to the dimer interface.\n\nFragment screening to identify small molecules\n\nOur in silico analysis suggests the presence of an evolutionarily conserved binding site at the interface between the α-chain and β2m. To find ligands for this cavity and, potentially, other sites, a solution-state NMR fragment screen was performed. For this purpose, we used an in-house library of approximately 1,100 molecules containing fluorine atoms to enable ligand interrogation by 19F Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill NMR [42,43]. This screen detected 143 potential binders. In order to select compounds for crystallographic studies, active molecules were further tested in Saturated Transfer Difference NMR experiments and by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), yielding an estimated KD of 80 μM for the highest affinity fragment, the racemate UCB-FcRn-84 (S3 Fig and S1 Data) [44,45]. Chiral separation showed preferential binding of the R enantiomer. Competition of UCB-FcRn-84 with IgG was tested in a FcRnECD–IgG FRET assay; however, no measurable inhibition was observed.\n\nCrystallographic studies of ligand-bound FcRnECD\n\nConfirmed hits from the fragment-screen were soaked into FcRnECD crystals that had been grown under acidic conditions. Based on the derived crystal structures, we aimed to further improve both affinity and solubility of the ligand.\n\nUCB-FcRn-84 was found in the conserved cavity at the interface of β2m and the α-chain (S4 Fig and S2 Text), as predicted by SiteMap. Key properties of binding interactions include burial of the 3-fluorophenyl group in a hydrophobic cavity composed of Y26β2m, S52β2m, Y63β2m, L65β2m, W29α-chain and P228α-chain. The most visually striking feature of the binding pocket is a tunnel-like cavity that extends through the middle of the protein (S5 Fig and S2 Text). The bicyclic ring of UCB-FcRn-84 occupies this cavity, being involved in one direct and one water-mediated hydrogen bond to the main-chain of Q34α-chain.\n\nAs the fragment was centrally located in this region, it afforded us a tractable chemical platform to explore the binding site further (S4 Fig and S2 Text). We attempted to improve the affinity of UCB-FcRn-84 by better occupying space around the 3-fluorophenyl group, which was nested in a well-defined hydrophobic pocket. Notably, we identified a small area available for growth adjacent to the unsubstituted meta position of the 3-fluorophenyl group. After scanning a range of disubstituted phenyl derivatives, we identified 3,5 difluorophenyl as the best option, yielding a ligand with 2.4 μM affinity for the racemate. Moreover, adding a 3-pyridile group in position 5 led to an equipotent compound (UCB-FcRn-303) but with improved solubility (S5 and S6 Figs, S1 Data and S2 Text).\n\nThe crystal structure of UCB-FcRn-303 bound to FcRnECD displays the R enantiomer (Fig 2 and S5 Fig). The binding mode is consistent with the position observed for UCB-FcRn-84 (Fig 2A and 2B, S4 and S5 Figs). The di-substituted phenyl ring better fills the hydrophobic pocket in the α-chain/β2m interface, while hydrogen bond interactions are maintained with the α-chain and the local water network.\n\nIn biochemical experiments molecules from our series did not inhibit IgG binding when tested in a FcRnECD–IgG FRET competition assay. This was consistent with our crystallographic studies which showed no discernible change in the IgG binding site, although accurate interpretation of small changes may be hampered by crystal contacts. The FcRnECD crystallized with two copies of the heterodimer present in the asymmetric unit, packing in an anti-parallel fashion (Fig 2A). Overlay of the IgG heavy chain–FcRnECD complex (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 1FRT) with the ligand-free crystal structure shows significant overlap between CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG and symmetry related copies of FcRnECD (S7 Fig) [46].\n\nIn order to determine whether the ligand might induce small conformational and/or dynamic changes in regions beyond the direct binding site, we have used orthogonal solution-based techniques, which will avoid conformational restrictions imposed by crystal packing.\n\nSedimented, fully protonated FcRnECD yielded well resolved proton-detected MAS NMR spectra\n\nUntil recently, solution-state and proton-detected MAS NMR typically required deuteration of proteins in the size-range of the 42 kDa FcRnECD, as the signal-to-noise ratios obtained in triple-resonance experiments involving 13Cβ and 13Cα chemical-shifts critically depend on the T2 of 13C coherences [47,48]. Since we were unable to produce deuterated FcRnECD in sufficient amounts it was not possible to acquire 3D solution-state NMR spectra that would allow sequential assignments. The spectral quality of a 2D 15N-1H correlation spectrum recorded in solution, however, is remarkably high (S8 Fig) [49]. It indicates that FcRnECD most likely does not form a stable dimer of heterodimers in solution at the applied concentrations, which agrees with biochemical data and earlier studies [50]. At least 227 of the expected 349 backbone amide signals could be observed, with the remainder of the signals most probably obscured by overlap.\n\nTo circumvent these experimental limitations, we applied MAS NMR. Progress in recent years, in particular ever faster sample spinning, enables the acquisition of proton-detected MAS NMR spectra on fully protonated samples which increases sensitivity and facilitates resonance assignments through triple-resonance experiments [51–54]. At the highest MAS frequency routinely available (110 kHz), well resolved proton spectra have been reported for fully protonated microcrystalline and membrane proteins, sedimented assemblies and fibrillar proteins [55–57].\n\nIn the present case, we have investigated soluble FcRnECD by MAS NMR experiments via sedimentation. For this purpose, the availability of dedicated filling tools is a prerequisite [58,59]. With the help of such appliances, we sedimented the 42 kDa soluble, fully protonated [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD by ultracentrifugation directly into a 0.7 mm MAS rotor (Fig 3A).\n\nThe 2D 15N-1H correlation spectrum measured at 100 kHz MAS is shown in Fig 3B. The observed linewidths demonstrate a remarkable spectral quality by MAS NMR standards (Fig 3C). Recorded at a magnetic field of about 20 T, the 1H and 15N linewidths of a selected typical cross peak are 184 Hz and 41 Hz, respectively. The amide 1H linewidth of FcRnECD is still higher than is observed in the model protein GB1, by a factor of approximately 1.8, but similar to the precipitated viral capsid coat protein AP205 [60]. The spectrum displays a large number of unresolved signals and a considerable fraction of signals that are well dispersed, both of which may be assigned on the basis of suitable triple-resonance spectra.\n\nIn order to monitor the folding state of FcRnECD in the sedimented sample, we compared the MAS 15N-1H spectrum to the 15N-1H correlation recorded in solution (S8 Fig and S3 Text). The agreement of the spectra indicates that the structure of FcRnECD in solution is very similar to the one in the sedimented sample. FcRnECD did not form the stable dimers of heterodimers in solution as had been observed in the crystal structure. Analytical ultracentrifugation, however, reveals a concentration-dependent protomer–diprotomer equilibrium of the FcRnECD heterodimer in solution, with a very low populated diprotomer fraction (S9 Fig and S4 Text). It is possible that this equilibrium is changed in the sedimentation process which may explain small chemical-shift differences. However, due to the signal overlap in the 15N-1H MAS NMR spectrum, a more detailed chemical-shift comparison is not possible.\n\nResonance assignments in proton-detected MAS NMR spectra of FcRnECD\n\nTo allow interpretation of chemical-shift perturbations (CSPs) upon binding of UCB-FcRn-303 to FcRnECD, resonance assignments are critical. The high MAS frequencies now available facilitate an assignment procedure based on triple-resonance MAS NMR experiments as in solution-state NMR. These include (H)CANH, (H)CBCANH, (H)CA(CO)NH, and (H)CBCA(CO)NH spectra, yielding assignments of 15N, 1HN, 13Cα0, and 13Cβ chemical-shifts [61,62]. If it is not possible to obtain a (H)CBCA(CO)NH spectrum with sufficient signal-to-noise due to too short 13Cα and 13CO relaxation times, the first two experiments allow for identification of amino acids that, in a following step, can be sequentially connected according to the protein sequence by using a (H)CA(CO)NH spectrum. In this study, such spectra were acquired on the fully protonated [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD enabling assignments of 25 α-chain residues close to the binding pocket and of 73% of all β2m residues.\n\nTo ease the assignment of β2m resonances, we made use of data in Beerbaum and colleagues, in which [2H,13C,15N]-labeled β2m was investigated in complex with unlabeled MHC1 [63]. However, the final assignments were achieved by establishing sequential connections along the protein backbone, as shown for the sequence from K41β2m to R45β2m (Fig 4). All chemical-shift assignments are listed in S1 Table and S2 Data and are deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) (accession number 27437). In total, signals of 98 residues were assigned this way (S1 Table, S2 Data, and S5 Text). The more sensitive (H)CANH spectrum contained 84 additional resolved cross peaks that could not be assigned further due to overlap or lacking correlations in the less sensitive (H)CA(CO)NH and (H)CBCANH spectra.\n\nInterestingly, a large number of the measured 13Cα, 13Cβ, 15N, and 1H chemical-shifts of β2m in the FcRnECD heterodimer match the observed solution-state NMR resonances for deuterated β2m in MHC1 complexes of the previous study (S1 Table and S5 Text) [63]. Differences in chemical-shifts can be explained by 1H/2H isotope effects, the limited number of amino acid substitutions in MHC1, potential dimers of FcRnECD heterodimers in the sedimented sample, and differences in buffer and temperature [64]. The similarity of the chemical-shifts supports the notion that β2m adopts its globular fold in the sedimented sample of FcRnECD. Based on these findings and on the similarity between the solution-state 15N-1H and MAS 15N-1H spectra, we assume the overall FcRnECD structure to be highly similar in solution and in sedimented samples (S8 Fig, S3 Text, S1 Table and S5 Text).\n\nIn summary, (H)CANH, (H)CA(CO)NH, and (H)CBCANH spectra represent an acceptable basis for obtaining backbone resonance assignments and allowed us to exploit CSPs as monitors for structural alterations in FcRnECD upon UCB-FcRn-303 binding.\n\nStructural changes in FcRnECD upon binding of UCB-FcRn-303\n\nCSPs (Δδ) are probes for both direct effects of ligand binding and concomitant long-range structural changes in receptor proteins that may hint at allosteric effects. Since differences between X-ray structures with and without ligand may be masked by crystal contacts, we analyzed this possibility by comparing 3D (H)CANH spectra recorded on samples of FcRnECD with and without UCB-FcRn-303 (Fig 5A and 5B). The introduction of a third dimension compared to a 2D 15N-1H correlation leads to better spectral resolution. The observed minimal chemical-shift differences are displayed in Fig 5A. Overall, many of the assigned signals show very similar chemical-shifts in both spectra (Δδ &lt; 0.02 ppm, white in Fig 5C and 5D), whereas signals that shift significantly (0.02 ppm &lt; Δδ &lt; 0.03 ppm, cyan; 0.03 ppm &lt; Δδ &lt; 0.04 ppm, marine; 0.04 ppm &lt; Δδ, dark blue in Fig 5C and 5D) appear well clustered, suggesting a conformational/dynamic change extending from the ligand binding site. In the following discussions, we consider all residues with Δδ &lt; 0.02 ppm as not perturbed. Selected cross peaks of strongly affected residues (0.04 ppm &lt; Δδ) are shown in 2D planes of the (H)CANH spectra with and without ligand (Fig 5B). The calculated CSPs shown in Fig 5A are based on the chemical-shift changes in all three spectral dimensions. Large CSPs displayed in Fig 5A may therefore not be obvious from the 2D planes shown in Fig 5B, see D96β2m.\n\nAs expected, strong effects are seen in the vicinity of the binding pocket of UCB-FcRn-303 observed by X-ray crystallography (G232α-chain, C48α-chain, G49α-chain and S52β2m, Fig 5A and 5C) since the chemical environment of these residues is altered upon binding.\n\nMore interestingly, several residues that experienced changes in their chemical-shifts are distant from the binding pocket. These include, for example, E54α-chain at the C-terminal end of the short α-helix close to the binding region (Fig 5C and 5D). Such an effect could potentially be explained by a small movement of the α-helix. Furthermore, strong CSPs can be observed in a rather remote region composed of loops in β2m, involving D96β2m, G18β2m, K19β2m, S20β2m, and H13β2m (Fig 5C and 5D). These residues cluster at the surface close to or at the interface of β2m and the α-chain of two different heterodimers seen in the asymmetric unit (Fig 6A and 6B). A second ligand binding site in this region of FcRnECD can be excluded since stoichiometric ratios &gt;1 were not observed in SPR experiments or by X-ray crystallography (Fig 2A, S3, S4, S5, S6 Figs, and S1 Data). Interestingly, strong shift changes were observed at comparably long distances from the small molecule binding site. Those strong CSPs may be direct effects of ligand binding, such as introducing a slight displacement of the β2m subunit with respect to the α-chain. Alternatively, it is possible that changes in the protomer–diprotomer equilibrium occur, and thus the chemical-shifts of residues at a potential diprotomer interface are affected. Although we do not observe a stable dimer of heterodimers in solution, a small fraction is present as seen in analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments (S9 Fig and S4 Text). A diprotomer may also be more highly populated at very high protein concentrations after the applied sedimentation through ultracentrifugation in preparation of 100 kHz MAS experiments. However, the samples with and without ligand have been prepared under identical conditions, making structural effects unrelated to ligand binding unlikely. For a ligand-induced alteration of the equilibrium, long-range structural changes towards the potential diprotomer interface are required, highlighting again the possibility for the occurrence of allosteric effects upon ligand binding.\n\nIn the HSA interaction site, a number of strongly affected residues could be found. These included R12β2m, H13β2m, C48α-chain, G49α-chain, A50α-chain, and E54α-chain with CSPs around 0.04 ppm or larger (Figs 5A, 6C and S2 Data). Some of these amino acids are close to the binding site of UCB-FcRn-303, but especially R12β2m, H13β2m, and E54α-chain are distant to it and may be therefore structurally altered through allosteric effects (Figs 5C and 6C). It is possible that the FcRn–HSA interaction can be modulated with UCB-FcRn-303. The binding site to HSA, however, is located at the possible diprotomer interface and CSPs in this region may be caused by potential ligand-induced changes in the protomer–diprotomer equilibrium of FcRnECD as discussed above.\n\nOf the NMR assigned residues, only a few from β2m are found in the IgG binding area, such as R3β2m and T86β2m (Fig 6C), for which negligible chemical-shift changes occur (Fig 5A) [46]. In general, residues in the β-sheet region of β2m distant from the binding site or the interface between heterodimers do not exhibit notable CSPs (Fig 5D).\n\nIn order to further investigate the potential for allosteric interference with IgG binding, we generated chemical-shift–informed overlays of the two FcRnECD crystal structures, with and without UCB-FcRn-303. All residues with Δδ &lt; 0.02 ppm (Fig 5A) were used for fitting, including the area around R3β2m, T86β2m, and L87β2m in β2m that is involved in IgG interaction (Fig 6C), yielding a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.095 Å. If a movement of the α-helical region of the α-chain could be induced upon ligand binding, it may disseminate towards the loop from D130α-chain to E133α-chain, which is part of the binding site to IgG (Fig 6C) [46]. Unfortunately, the overlay does not reveal any significant structural changes of α-chain residues close to this loop, except for subtle differences, which we are unable to isolate as a compound-induced effect due to its proximity to crystal packing interactions. Still, the CSPs observed distant to the ligand cavity reveal the potential for allosteric effects in FcRnECD induced by UCB-FcRn-303 by affecting the HSA interaction site. This provides evidence that binding of an optimized ligand could be aimed at displacing the β2m and α-chain subunits and distally disrupting the IgG binding interface of FcRnECD.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the context of a druggability study, we identified a compound of &lt;500 Da molecular weight, UCB-FcRn-303, that binds to the extracellular domain of FcRn with low μM affinity. The conserved binding site is located at the interface of β2m and the α-chain, featuring a tunnel-like cavity with solvent access from two different sides. The pocket was identified by computational chemistry methods in a theoretical druggability examination and was corroborated by fragment screening, X-ray crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy. The respective crystal structures show a dimer of heterodimers, with a 1:1 stoichiometry for the ligand/protein complex.\n\nDue to the distance of about 35 Å between the small molecule binding pocket and the site of IgG interaction (Fig 6C), substantial allosteric effects would be required for pharmacologically relevant interference with IgG binding [46]. Such allosteric effects can be monitored by comparing X-ray structures with and without ligand and by NMR spectroscopy via the analysis of ligand-induced CSPs. We therefore established a new approach for testing ligand binding effects on soluble proteins, employing proton-detected 100 kHz MAS NMR spectroscopy on fully protonated FcRnECD. After successful sedimentation of the protein by ultracentrifugation using dedicated filling tools, remarkably well-resolved proton-detected MAS NMR spectra could be obtained and partially assigned. CSPs upon UCB-FcRn-303 binding are observed around the small molecule binding pocket but also distant residues are affected, however, overlapping with the HSA interaction site.\n\nSince a large fraction of residues in β2m towards the IgG binding site and some in the α-chain do not show substantial CSPs (Figs 5A, 6A and 6C), we generated alignments of the two X-ray structures with and without ligand, superposing the nonshifting residues. This approach revealed no substantial changes of residues close to the IgG interaction site upon FcRn-UCB-303 binding, which could modulate the FcRnECD–IgG interaction. It may be envisaged that an optimized ligand could produce a shift of the α-helical region in the α-chain, with potential effects on IgG interaction. Such an optimization could include derivatives with additional functional groups that enter the α-chain/β2m interface and thus produce a slight displacement of the two with respect to each other. Strong CSPs could be observed in the HSA interaction site of FcRnECD, highlighting the potential to achieve a functional modulation of FcRn with UCB-FcRn-303. However, it cannot be fully excluded that changes in oligomeric state of FcRnECD caused by the ligand under MAS conditions lead to the observed CSPs in this region.\n\nThe presented MAS NMR methodology provides an appealing approach for structural investigations of large, soluble proteins expressed in mammalian or other types of eukaryotic cells in which deuteration is challenging, especially in cases when glycosylation is crucial. Moreover, it extends the range of NMR applications to pharmacologically relevant targets, which are often inaccessible by solution-state NMR methods due to size. The MAS NMR approach works with high molecular weight targets and is independent of the physical state of the sample, providing spectral complexity can be handled, e.g., by applying appropriate labelling concepts. This facilitates protein-ligand interaction studies by NMR for any type of protein or biomolecular complex, making previously intractable pharmacological targets accessible, such as the ribosome, G protein-coupled receptors, and the like. Our investigation shows that MAS NMR complements X-ray crystallography in structure-based drug discovery campaigns. It is particularly useful to explore allosteric changes beyond small molecule binding sites, which may be difficult to observe by X-ray crystallography.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nFcRnECD vector generation\n\nThe coding sequences of extracellular domain (ECD) (amino acids 1–297) of human FcRn α-chain and human β2m were synthesized by Entelechon (Entelechon, Regensburg, Germany). The α-chain fragment was cloned into the expression vector pMH (UCB) and the β2m sequence was cloned into pMK (UCB) as HindIII and EcoRI fragments. Both vectors were digested with SalI and NotI and the relevant fragments excised and ligated to generate a vector containing both the α-chain and β2m genes (pM-ECDFcRn-B2M).\n\nThe vector was further digested with SalI and a neomycin cassette was ligated in to generate a double gene vector with antibiotic selection (pMFcRnECD-B2M-Neo).\n\nGeneration of a FcRnECD stable mammalian cell line\n\nHEK293 cells were transfected with pMFcRnECD-B2M-Neo using 293fectin (Thermofisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected cells were incubated in a static incubator at 37 °C and 8% CO2 for 24 hours. The cells were then diluted to the required concentration with medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L G418 (Invitrogen) and subsequently divided into 1-mL pools in 24-well plates and incubated in a static incubator at 37 °C with 8% CO2. Every 7 days, the medium was removed from each well and replaced with fresh medium. After a further 14 days, the pools that exhibited cell growth were transferred to 6-well plates. These were expanded up to 50-mL cultures in E250 flasks in shaking incubators. To determine total expression of the FcRnECD heterodimer composed of β2m and α-chain, batch overgrows were set up and incubated for 10 days.\n\nSamples of the 50-mL batch overgrow supernatants were analyzed for FcRnECD expression using western blotting. 15 μL of each supernatant was run on a (denatured Tris/Gly gel western blot) alongside known concentrations of purified human FcRn as a control.\n\nThe highest expressing pool was expanded (without Neomycin selection) up to 10-L scale in a Wave Bioreactor 20/50 EHT at 37 °C, 8% CO2 for 4 days, at which point the temperature was reduced to 32 °C and incubated for a further 6 days. The cell culture was harvested by centrifugation (1,000x g for 1 hour) and supernatant put through a 0.22-μm filter.\n\nPurification of FcRnECD expressed in HEK293 cells\n\nMammalian cell culture supernatant containing the heterodimer FcRnECD was concentrated with a 10,000 MWCO membrane using tangential flow filtration (Centramate, Pall) or Amicon stirred cell (Millipore), depending on scale. The sample buffer was exchanged into 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 30 mM NaCl by diluting and concentrating. FcRnECD was loaded onto a KappaSelect (GE Healthcare) column, which had been preloaded with an IgG4 monoclonal antibody to bind FcRnECD, before washing with 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 30 mM NaCl, and eluting with 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and relevant fractions pooled.\n\nThe sample was concentrated using an Amicon spin concentrator (Millipore), 10,000 MWCO membrane. The protein was purified by Gel Filtration with a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column using 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before pooling and concentrating if required.\n\nSPR analysis\n\nSPR was carried out using BIAcore 4000 instruments (GE Healthcare). Reagents including CM5 sensor chips, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), and ethanolamine HCl, 10 mM sodium acetate buffers (pH 5.0, pH 4.5) and HBS-P (10x buffer) were obtained from GE Healthcare.\n\nFcRnECD was diluted into 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 and immobilized on a CM5 Sensor Chip via amine coupling chemistry to a capture level of approxmimately 4,000 response units. Compounds were screened in a 10-point titration from 200 μM, at 2% DMSO, pH 6.0, and the surface was re-immobilized after each 384-well plate. Injections were performed at a flow rate of 10 μL/min.\n\nAll data were double-referenced for blank injections and reference surface, following standard procedures. Both data processing and fitting were performed using Activity Base template protocols developed in house.\n\nFragment library screening using 19F NMR\n\nA library of approximately 1,100 fluorine-containing fragments were cocktailed into groups of 12 ensuring no overlap of 19F signals. Cocktails were initially prepared at a concentration of 4.2 mM in d6-DMSO and diluted to 800 μM in PBS pH 7.4 before a final dilution to 40 μM ligand concentration (1% d6-DMSO) in either PBS containing 10% D2O (for control samples) or 20 μM FcRnECD containing 10% D2O (for protein samples). NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz AVIII-HD spectrometer equipped with a QCI-F cryoprobe and a SampleJet autosampler. Data were collected using a CPMG pulse sequence with a total echo time of 160 ms across a sweep width of 126 ppm with an acquisition time of 1 s. All spectra were processed using TopSpin 3.2. Fragments were considered binders to FcRnECD when the 19F signal intensity was significantly reduced in the spectra with FcRnECD present compared to the spectra recorded in the absence of protein.\n\nFragment library screening using STD NMR\n\nSTD NMR samples were prepared with a ligand to protein ratio of 50:1 (500 μM ligand, 10 μM FcRnECD) in 500 μL phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (90% H2O, 10% D2O) with 5% d6-DMSO to help solubilize the ligand. STD NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance III HD 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm QCI-F Cryoprobe. Data were acquired and processed using the standard Bruker software and were collected at 298 K. The protein was saturated in the methyl region of the spectrum at 0 ppm, and off-resonance saturation was performed at 33 ppm. A series of 120 EBurp2 pulses (50 ms each) were applied with a 4-μs delay between each pulse, resulting in total saturation time of 6 s. Protein signals were removed by applying a spinlock of 100 ms. Interleaved on- and off-resonance data were recorded, processed separately, and then the difference spectra obtained by subtracting the on- from the off-resonance spectra. Data were zero filled once and an exponential multiplication window function applied (LB 2 Hz).\n\nPlasmid construction of FcRnECD for expression in Sf9 insect cells\n\nThe parent construct for α-chain/β2m expresses two Open Reading Frames (ORFs) within one baculovirus multiple-target expression plasmid, pBacugs4X-1. Protein targets are based on the following amino acid sequences (both α-chain and β2m each contain their native leaders): α-chain 1–297 based on NCBI reference sequence NP_004098, β2m 1–119 based on NCBI reference sequence NP_004039. Codons for both ORFs were engineered by GeneComposer for highly expressed baculovirus genes, such that BamHI, HindIII, BglII, and EcoRI restriction sites were eliminated from the inserts to facilitate cloning [65]. Both genes, including flanking restriction sites, were synthesized at GeneArt. The ORF for α-chain was cloned behind the polyhedrin promoter via unique BamHI and HindIII sites; in this case, the BamHI site preceded the signal sequence while HindIII followed the sequence “TGAT” such that two stops are introduced after the C-terminal residue. The ORF for β2m was cloned behind the p10 promoter via unique BglII and EcoRI sites; the BglII site preceded the signal sequence, while EcoRI followed the sequence “TGATAA” such that two stops are introduced after the C-terminal residue. Using this cloning scheme, polyhedrin and p10 promoters are arranged in divergent/opposing orientations within the baculovirus transfer vector. ORFs were sequence verified prior to the commencement of expression studies.\n\nExpression of FcRnECD in Sf9 insect cells\n\nThe α-chain/β2m construct was transfected into Sf9 insect cells (Expression Systems) using BestBac 2.0, v-cath/chiA Deleted Linearized Baculovirus DNA (Expression Systems, Cat#-91-002). Virus from each transfection was amplified through 3 rounds to produce virus stock for large-scale production. The large-scale preparations were grown in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems, Cat#96–001). Large-scale preparations were infected using the titerless infected-cells preservation and scale-up (TIPS) method [66]. Approximately 106 Tni cells (Trichopulsia ni, Expression Systems) per mL were infected using 1 mL of TIPS cells. Secreted proteins were harvested after 2–3 days by Tangential Flow Filtration (Spectrum KrosFlo, 0.2 μm filter Cat# P-NO2-E20U-05-N).\n\nPurification of FcRnECD expressed in Sf9 insect cells\n\nHarvested baculovirus medium (Trichoplusia ni) containing secreted FcRnECD was concentrated 10-fold and buffer exchanged (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 5.8 and 30 mM NaCl via Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF) (Spectrum Labs). The concentrated medium was centrifuged using a JA-10 rotor at 9,000 RPM for 15 minutes at 4 °C and then filtered through a 0.2 μm bottle top filter. Three complete EDTA free protease inhibitor tablets were added to the concentrated media prior to chromatography. The filtered concentrated medium was applied to 35 mL of IgG Sepharose FF resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, and 30 mM NaCl (Sigma) and rotated end over end for one hour at 4 °C. The resin was then poured into a gravity flow column and washed with 10 column volumes of the same equilibration buffer. FcRnECD was eluted from the resin with eight column volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and 30 mM NaCl. The elution fractions containing FcRnECD were pooled and loaded onto two 5-mL HiTrap Q FF columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted over a 1 M NaCl gradient. The fractions of interest were pooled and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. The pool was concentrated to 15 mg/mL via centrifugal concentration (Amicon Regenerated Cellulose, 10 kDa MWCO, Millipore) and further purified via size exclusion chromatography over a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare) column in 50 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) pH 7.0 and 75 mM NaCl. The fractions containing FcRnECD were pooled and concentrated for crystallography via centrifugal concentration (Amicon Regenerated Cellulose, 10 kDa MWCO, Millipore) to 9.9 mg/mL prior to being aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use in crystallization experiments.\n\nCrystallization of FcRnECD\n\nIn order to search for crystallization conditions for FcRnECD expressed in insect cells, sitting-drop vapor diffusion crystallization trials were set up at 291 K using a variety of commercial spare-matrix (Rigaku Reagents: JCSG+, Wizard 1/2, Wizard 3/4; Hampton Research: Crystal Screen HTIndex; Molecular Dimensions: PACT, Morpheus, Proplex; Microlytics: MCSG1) using 0.4 μL of protein solution at 5 mg/mL that were mixed with 0.4 μL of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 80 μL of reservoir solution. The initial crystallization trials produced small kite crystals in several conditions that contain PEG 3350, PEG 6000, or PEG 8000 at low pH. Low pH crystals of FcRnECD were produced in an optimized crystallization condition screen (Rigaku) containing 12%–16% PEG 6000, 100 mM Citric Acid/Ammonium citrate tribasic pH 3.00–3.09. Crystals of FcRnECD appeared within 24 hours and grew larger overtime, typically to 50–150 microns in size. The crystals were harvested using 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection.\n\nAdditionally, small rod-like crystals appeared in a single condition at a significantly higher pH (condition PACT H3, 100 mM Bis-Tris Propane/HCl pH 8.5, 200 mM NaI, and 20% PEG 3350) [67]. High/neutral pH crystals of FcRnECD were produced in optimized crystallization condition containing 100 mM Bis-Tris Propane/HCl pH 8.5, 200 mM NaI, and 20% PEG 3350. Crystals of FcRnECD appeared within 48 hours and grew larger overtime, typically greater than 150 microns in size. The crystals were harvested using 20% ethylene glycol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. To obtain compound bound crystals, apo FcRnECD crystals grown at pH 3 were soaked for three days in buffer containing 0.1 M Citric Acid/NaOH at pH 3.0, 20% w/v PEG 6000, 20% glycerol, and 12.5–20 mM compound dissolved in 100% DMSO. For crystallization of the UCB-FcRn-303 bound structure of FcRnECD, protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells was used.\n\nStructure determination by X-ray crystallography\n\nDatasets were collected at Canadian Light Source (CLS) on beamline 08ID-1 (CMCF) equipped with a Rayonix MX300 CCD X-ray detector and Advanced Photon Source (APS) on beamline 21-ID-F (LS-CAT) equipped with a Marmosaic 225 CCD X-ray detector. Diffraction data were reduced and scaled with XDS/XSCALE [68]. The structures of FcRnECD at low and high/neutral pH were solved by molecular replacement using a pre-existing structure of the complex. A significant portion of the structure required remodeling; therefore, Phenix.autobuild was run to generate a starting structure for further refinement. All structures were refined using iterative cycles of TLS and restrained refinement with Phenix.refine and model-building using the Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit (COOT; Version 0.8.1-pre) and were validated using Molprobity prior to deposition in the PDB (IDs 6C97, 6C98, 6C99) [69–73]. Diffraction data and refinement statistics for apo FcRnECD at pH 3 and both ligand bound structures are listed in S2 Table.\n\nMolecular dynamics simulation\n\nThe FcRnECD structures at pH 3 and pH 8.5 were used as the starting points for molecular dynamics simulation, after adding hydrogen. Protonation states and missing loops were predicted with Maestro (Schrödinger LLC). The structure was solvated in a dodecahedron such that no protein atom was within 10 Å of the edge of the solvent. Monatomic ions were added to a salt concentration of 0.15 M. All simulations were 1,000 ns in length and were carried out with GROMACS 4.6.2 [74]. Particle mesh Ewald was used for long-range electrostatics along with 10 Å cutoffs for Coulomb and Lennard–Jones potential functions.\n\nExpression of fully protonated [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD for NMR experiments\n\nFcRnECD was expressed using a stable HEK293 cell line, as described above, but the growth media was replaced with Bioexpress 6000 media (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).\n\nAcquisition of 2D 15N-1H TROSY solution-state NMR spectrum on fully protonated [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD\n\nThe solution-state 2D 15N-1H TROSY spectrum was acquired from a 0.35-mL sample of 300 μM [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD in a 25 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 μM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 buffer at pH 7.4 containing 5% D2O/95% H2O [49]. NMR data were acquired at 35 °C on a 600 MHz Bruker AVIII HD spectrometer fitted with a cryogenically cooled probe. The spectrum was acquired for 40 minutes with acquisition times of 40 ms in F1 (15N) and 60 ms in F2 (1H). It was processed using Topspin 3.5 (Bruker Biospin Ltd) with linear prediction used to extend the effective acquisition time to 60 ms in F1.\n\nSedimentation of FcRnECD by ultracentrifugation for NMR experiments using fast MAS\n\nA 0.5-mL sample of 100 μM [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD in a 25 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 μM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 buffer at pH 7.4 containing 3% DMSO was directly ultracentrifuged into a 0.7 mm MAS NMR rotor at 100,000 x g and 4 °C for 40 hours using a swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor. Dedicated home-made filling tools were used for this step. Both bottom and top caps of the 0.7 mm MAS rotor were glued to avoid the loss of liquid or removal of caps during MAS. Excess protein and liquid after ultracentrifugation was removed before closing the 0.7 mm NMR MAS rotor. For experiments to detect CSPs, 3 mM UCB-FcRn-303 was added to a 0.5-mL sample of 100 μM [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD in a 25 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 μM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 buffer at pH 7.4 containing 3% DMSO (ligand:protein ratio of 30:1). The ligand-bound sample was sedimented into a second 0.7 mm MAS rotor under the same conditions as the ligand-free sample.\n\nProton-detected NMR experiments using fast MAS on fully protonated [13C,15N]-labeled FcRnECD\n\nAll MAS NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 850 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were recorded at 80, 90, or 100 kHz MAS with a triple-resonance 0.7 mm MAS probe (Bruker) and referenced to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) (see S3 Table for experimental parameters). The sample temperature of 283 K was monitored by the frequency of the water resonance line. To achieve this sample temperature, the sample was cooled during MAS using nitrogen gas through a cooling unit (BCU II, Bruker) in strong mode with the gas flow set to 400 L/h. (H)NH, (H)CANH, (H)CA(CO)NH, and (H)CBCANH spectra were recorded using Cross Polarization (CP) (heteronuclear transfers) and DREAM (homonuclear transfers) magnetization transfer steps according to the procedures described in Penzel and colleagues [61,75,76]. All spectra were processed with Topspin 3.5 (Bruker) and analyzed with CCPNmr Analysis v. 2.4.2. [77]. All assigned chemical-shifts and observed CSPs are listed in S1 Table and S2 Data, and are deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) (accession number 27437).\n\nAnalytical ultracentrifugation of FcRnECD\n\nSedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 8 °C and 35,000 rpm with an An-60Ti rotor using 12-mm Epon 2-sector centerpieces. For each of the three measurements at different FcRnECD concentrations (4 μM, 14 μM, and 52 μM), a 400-μL sample in 10 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 buffer at pH 7.2 was used.
