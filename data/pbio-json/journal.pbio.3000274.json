  "abstract": "Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are well studied for their role in binding and charging tRNAs with cognate amino acids.

Introducing point mutations that are expected to disassemble this putative anticodon mimic alleviated self-association, concomitant with increased synthesis of the protein. Finally, we found that increased cellular levels of uncharged tRNAHis lead to reduced self-association and increased HisRS translation, in a manner that depends on the anticodon-like element.

  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) encompass a significant fraction of an organism proteome and are implicated in many cellular processes [1]. The group of RBPs that bind mRNA is likely to be most critical for expression regulation. In the course of an mRNA’s maturation, different RBPs bind the transcript and mediate its nuclear processing, its export out of the nucleus, cellular localization, translation, and degradation [2,3]. Therefore, identification and characterization of novel mRNA-binding protein (mRBPs) is a central goal in molecular biology.\n\nRecent high-throughput studies applied an unbiased approach whereby polyadenylated RNAs and their associated proteins were isolated through an oligo dT column and proteins were identified by mass spectrometry [4,5]. These RNA interactome studies identified many novel mRBPs from various organisms and cell types [6–13]. Interestingly, many of these novel mRBPs are enzymes with well-established metabolic roles of which mRNA regulation appeared as an additional function [14,15].\n\nA recurring family of enzymes that was observed among these studies is the family of cytosolic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs). aaRSs recognize their cognate tRNA and amino acid and perform the charging reaction of the amino acid at the 3′ end of the tRNA with the expanse of an ATP [16]. Most cells have 20 different cytosolic aaRSs, each one responsible to ligate an amino acid to its cognate tRNAs [17]. Cells also encode aaRSs that are localized in mitochondria and charge tRNAs that are transcribed by the mitochondrial genome. Previous studies revealed noncatalytic functions for some aaRSs, including transcription regulation, cellular signaling, and mitochondrial splicing (reviewed by [16,18]). Three aaRSs, from diverse species, were documented to bind mRNA and exert a post-transcriptional role: the mammalian glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (GluProRS) is part of a multiprotein complex that regulates mRNA expression through binding to the 3′ UTR of mRNAs [19], and its mechanism of action and activation pathway are well studied [20]. The Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) can bind its own mRNA in a region upstream to the start codon (“operator” region) [21,22] and autoregulates its translation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) was also found to bind in vitro its own mRNA [23] and to regulate its nuclear export upon overexpression of tRNAAsp [24].\n\nThe abundant detection of aaRS in interactome studies suggests that mRNA binding is far more common than the three cases mentioned above. For example, all 20 aaRSs were detected by mass spectrometry as bound to polyA RNA in at least one of the analyses done for S. cerevisiae (S1 Table), yet only AspRS was known to do so before. Furthermore, only a single mRNA target was characterized for each of these synthetases (E.coli ThrRS and S. cerevisiae AspRS bind their own mRNA, and GluProRS binds the ceruloplasmin mRNA [Cp mRNA]); therefore, the generality of mRNA association is not clear.\n\nHerein applied an in vivo genomic approach to identify the mRNA targets of several S. cerevisiae aaRSs. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by RNA-seq revealed that each aaRS binds a unique subset of mRNAs. Moreover, all tested aaRSs appeared to bind their own mRNA much better than most other mRNAs. Histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) had the most striking self-association and appeared to bind its own mRNA orders of magnitude higher than any other mRNA. Mapping the mRNA-binding site revealed a site with high similarity to the tRNAHis anticodon loop, and a set of mutations confirmed the importance of this anticodon mimic for binding. We further show that binding represses translation of HisRS, and this repression is alleviated upon increase in tRNA levels. These data present a novel autoregulatory loop that controls translation through protein binding to an anticodon mimic within the mRNA.\n\nResults\n\naaRSs bind diverse sets of mRNAs\n\nWe analyzed data from three RNA interactome studies performed for S. cerevisiae [7,10,11] and found that all 20 cytosolic aaRSs were detected in at least one study and the vast majority in two or all three studies (S1 Table). We therefore aimed at exploring the repertoire of mRNAs bound by aaRSs. To this end, we utilized yeast strains expressing endogenously, C-terminally Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP)-tagged methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS), and HisRS or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HisRS and glutamine-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS). These aaRSs appeared to be associated with mRNA in at least two of the yeast interactome studies (S1 Table). Cells were grown to midlogarithmic phase, cross-linked by formaldehyde, and subjected to RIP with anti-GFP conjugated beads (GFP-Trap) or proteinA beads (for TAP fusions). Protein samples from the initial extract (Input), flow-through of the beads (FT), last washing step (LW), and the bound material (Bound) were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) followed by western analysis (S1A Fig) and revealed high efficiency and specificity of the isolation protocol. This was also demonstrated for HisRS-GFP by silver staining (S1B Fig), whereby the only detected band in the Bound sample is of the HisRS-GFP protein.\n\nRNA samples were prepared from before the purification (Input), representing the total transcriptome of the strain, and from the Bound sample, representing the transcripts that are associated with each aaRS. As a control for nonspecific association with the beads, we performed similar isolation procedures (TAP and GFP-Trap) to an untagged strain (BY4741). RNA samples from the Input and Bound fractions from all tagged and untagged strains were subjected to RNA-seq, and signals for about 5,000 different mRNAs were obtained in each (S2 Table). mRNAs that were efficiently bound by each aaRS were determined by calculating the ratio between Bound and Input reads for each mRNA (“RIP efficiency”) (S2 Table). The division by the Input reads accounts for differences in abundance and length between mRNAs. Analysis of the top ranked mRNAs in each RIP-seq revealed that many target mRNAs are shared among several aaRS (S2 Fig). However, the vast majority of these also appeared to be highly ranked in the RIP-seq analysis of the corresponding untagged strain (S2A Fig and S2B Fig); therefore, their significance is unclear. To account for such non-aaRS–mediated interaction with the beads, we subtracted for each gene its observed RIP efficiency in the untagged strain. This resulted in a background-corrected RIP efficiency value for each mRNA (Fig 1A and S2 Table).\n\nGluRS appeared to have the largest number of targets (213 mRNAs, after excluding those that appeared also in the untagged strain RIP-seq). Ninety-nine of these were bound exclusively by GluRS (within 1.5 InterQuartile Range [IQR] above the average) (S3 Table). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis for these revealed that GluRS preferentially binds mRNAs that encode proteins with Transcription Regulator activity (S4 Table). Interestingly, the 62 shared targets of GluRS and HisRS were also enriched for this family (S2A Fig and S4 Table). This suggests that GluRS acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of transcription factors and may work solo on some targets and together with HisRS on other targets.\n\nGluRS also shares 11 target mRNAs with MetRS, including the mRNAs encoding GluRS and MetRS themselves (S3 Table) (see below). Several other aaRSs shared a large number of mRNA targets, including MetRS and ValRS (24 targets), MetRS and HisRS (12 targets), and HisRS and GlnRS (26 targets) (S2 Fig and S3 Table). The group bound by HisRS and GlnRS included 16 mRNAs encoding proteins with ion-binding activity (GO: 00431670), including the mRNAs encoding AspRS and GlnRS and the serine/threonine kinases VPS15 and PKH2 (S3 Table). However, the processes that these 16 ion binders are involved in appear very diverse and with no obvious common features. Overall, their significance necessitates further investigation.\n\nmRNAs bound exclusively by MetRS appeared to be highly enriched for those encoding proteins that bind ATP (32 of the 115 mRNAs) (S4 Table). MetRS was shown previously to have a role in activation of transcription of ATP synthesis genes upon yeast diauxic shift [25]. Our data suggest an additional role in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs encoding proteins that utilize ATP for their activity. MetRS might therefore be a coordinator of ATP synthesis by ATP synthase and ATP utilization by ATPases.\n\naaRSs preferentially bind their own mRNA\n\nA common feature that appeared for each aaRSs that we tested was a strong association with its own mRNA (“self-association”) (Fig 1A). HisRS (by either TAP or GFP protocols) and GlnRS were ranked first among approximately 5,000 mRNAs that appeared as bound by each protein, MetRS mRNA was ranked second of 5,089 mRNAs that appeared as bound by MetRS protein, ValRS 16 of 5,104, and GluRS mRNA was ranked 76 of 5,124 (Fig 1A and S2 Table). Self-association may imply an autogenous post-transcriptional regulatory process. The fact that self-association was observed for every aaRS that we tested suggests that this process is common to all S. cerevisiae aaRSs.\n\nTo validate these sequencing results by an alternative approach, we performed semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to RNA samples from the Input or Bound samples (Fig 1B). cDNA from the indicated preparations was subjected to PCR with specific primers, and aliquots from the same PCR cycle were resolved in agarose gel. Clear signal for HisRS is apparent in the Bound sample from either its GFP or TAP samples. This is not due to a contaminating DNA since no signal is detected in the control reaction without the RT enzyme. Importantly, while Actin signal appears much higher in the Input sample, no signal is detected in any of the Bound samples. Similarly, MetRS and ValRS mRNAs are detected in their respective RIP. Furthermore, the mRNA for GluRS is detected as highly associated with MetRS, even higher than MetRS mRNA. This is consistent with the RIP-seq data of MetRS-TAP, in which GluRS mRNA is ranked higher (first) than MetRS mRNA (second) (Fig 1A and S2 Table). Overall, these results are consistent with the relative associations of aaRSs that were observed by the RIP-seq analysis and confirm that aaRSs are associated with their own mRNA.\n\nGluRS and MetRS are known to charge their cognate tRNAs while in a trimeric complex with Arc1 (Arc1:MetRS:GluRS [AME] complex) [26,27]. The coisolation of their mRNAs suggest that also their mRNA binding occurs while in a complex. We thus performed RIP followed by semiquantitative RT-PCR for GFP-tagged Arc1 protein. Clear signal of mRNAs encoding both complex partners, MetRS and GluRS, was detected (Fig 1C). Recently, Shiber A. and colleagues [28] had shown that assembly of the AME complex occurs cotranslationally, whereby MetRS interacts with the nascent chain of GluRS as it emerges from the ribosome and vice versa for GluRS. This process generates indirect interactions between MetRS and the translated mRNAs of GluRS and thus may explain our RIP results. Intriguingly, however, neither GluRS nor MetRS were found to associate with their own nascent chain [28]. This may suggest that the self-association that we observe for GluRS or MetRS are indirect ones, in which isolation of MetRS-TAP leads to isolation of the entire AME complex, thus MetRS mRNA is isolated due to its association with GluRS protein. To test this possibility, we deleted Arc1 from MetRS-TAP strain (thus disassembling the trimeric complex [26,27]) and subjected it to RIP-seq analysis, as above. As can be seen in Fig 1A, the self mRNA was highly ranked even upon complex disassembly, while GluRS mRNA was significantly downgraded (Fig 1A). Thus, self-association is independent of the AME complex while partner association depends on complex assembly. These data therefore reveal at least two interaction modes for MetRS: a cotranslational-dependent one with GluRS mRNA and a cotranslational- and complex-independent one with self mRNA.\n\nTo obtain insights to whether self-association can be also observed by other cross-linking approaches, we applied UV cross-linking (which was proposed to induce direct interactions between RNA and proteins [29]) to HisRS-TAP cells. HisRS-TAP was subjected to varying RNaseI treatments and then immunoprecipitated (S3 Fig). HisRS–cross-linked RNAs were labeled at the 5' end by 32P and resolved in a gel. HisRS proteins of increased sizes are apparent due to their associated RNA fragments (S3B Fig). Importantly, when bound RNA was extracted from the protein and resolved on a gel, species larger than 100 nts were clearly detected (S3C Fig). Thus, HisRS binds RNA species that are longer than tRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) to target specific mRNAs that are associated with HisRS yielded positive signals for HisRS mRNA, much higher than a control mRNA (MetRS mRNA) (Fig 1D). Similar UV cross-linking–IP experiment with MetRS-GFP resulted the same, i.e., high signal for self mRNA and lower to the control, HisRS mRNA (Fig 1D). These results indicate that association, at least for these two examples, is likely through direct interaction of the synthetase with its mRNA.\n\nHisRS binds mRNA through its anticodon-binding domain\n\nThe self-association of HisRS appears to be in orders of magnitude higher compared to other cellular mRNAs (Fig 1A). This was apparent in both preparations from either the TAP- or GFP-tagged strains. The TAP and GFP-Trap protocols have several important differences, including the use of different antibodies, different beads, and a different elution method. Thus, self-association is independent of the purification protocol. We thus wished to determine the domain through which HisRS binds its mRNA. HisRS contains two domains that are important for proper charging of its tRNA: the catalytic domain (CD), which recognizes the acceptor stem and performs the charging reaction, and the anticodon-binding domain (ABD), which interacts with the anticodon loop (Fig 2A). Crystal structure of HisRS from Thermus thermophilus revealed that these are the primary contacts with tRNA (Fig 2B) [30]. To determine which of these domains is important for mRNA recognition, we fused each of them to GFP under the control of an alcohol dehydrogenase 1(ADH1) promoter. Plasmids were introduced into cells that also express an endogenous untagged HisRS transcript, and strains were subjected to GFP-Trap mRNA isolation. Samples were analyzed by semiquantitative PCR with primers that recognize only the endogenous transcript (Fig 2C). The results show an approximate 10-fold higher association of the mRNA with the ABD-GFP protein, indicating that mRNA recognition is mainly through the ABD. Notably, due to the primers design, the RT-PCR signals result only from the endogenous transcript, which is not GFP tagged. This demonstrates that HisRS protein interacts with mRNA in trans.\n\nHisRS is known to efficiently dimerize, which raises the possibility of cotranslational association between the fully synthesized protein and a nascent dimerization domain. This may lead to a cotranslational dependent isolation of mRNA, as described for GluRS mRNA with MetRS-GFP. To explore this possibility, we introduced either CD-GFP or ABD-GFP plasmids into the TAP-tagged endogenous HisRS. We performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using anti-GFP beads and tested the copurification of the endogenous, TAP-tagged HisRS. Analysis of the IP efficiency (by anti-GFP antibodies) revealed that both CD-GFP and ABD-GFP were isolated at similar levels. However, co-IP of HisRS-TAP was observed in the CD-GFP IP and not in the ABD-GFP IP (Fig 2D). Thus, consistent with crystallographic studies [31], the N-terminal region (which contains the CD), is the main dimerization region of HisRS. We conclude that the ABD domain is unlikely to associate with the emerging nascent chain and it interacts with mRNA in a non-cotranslational manner.\n\nHisRS interacts with a putative anticodon mimic within its mRNA\n\nWe next wished to identify the site(s) along the mRNA that HisRS binds in vivo. To this end, we devised a fragmentation RIP procedure (fRIP) (Fig 3A). Extracts from cross-linked HisRS-GFP cells were subjected to mild RNaseI treatment to generate fragments of an average length of 200 nts (Fig 3B). Fragmented samples were then subjected to GFP-Trap isolation, which efficiently isolates HisRS-GFP with its associated fragments; thus, nonassociated fragments are washed away. Bound RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed with random hexamers. To identify the bound HisRS mRNA region, cDNA was subjected to PCR with 14 pairs of primers that tile the entire ORF region of HisRS (Fig 3C). These sets were spaced evenly along the gene to yield products of similar size (150 bp), hence lower variation in PCR efficiency (an exception is pair 12, which, due to Tm constraints, was planned to generate a slightly longer product). Control reactions were done with an unfragmented RNA sample (Fig 3C, upper panel) and with fragmented input prior to RNA isolation (Fig 3C, middle panel). The latter served to normalize differences in the efficiencies of RT-PCR reactions. As can be seen clearly in Fig 3C, bottom panel, fragment 10 (nucleotides 960–1,110 from the start codon) appears to be the most enriched by the fRIP procedure, hence likely to include the binding site. The signals of fragments 8 and 9 are probably due to a partial cleavage by the RNaseI, which leaves longer RNA fragments with the binding site. The lack of a complementing positive signal in fragment 11 is likely due to its low-PCR amplification efficiency, as evident from the “Fragmented Input” (Fig 3C).\n\nConsidering that the ABD was found to be important for binding (Fig 2C), we hypothesized that the RNA target site will be in an anticodon-like structure. In S. cerevisiae, HisRS recognizes only a single tRNAHis, with a GUG in its anticodon loop (Fig 2B). RNA structural analysis [32] for fragment 10 region revealed a GUG within a stem-loop structure (note that the GUG is not in frame and is split between two codon: GGU [codon 366] and GUC [codon 367]) (Fig 4A). To determine whether this site is important for binding, we varied it by introducing two point mutations that are predicted to disrupt this element (Fig 4A): a single-base mutation that changes the anticodon-like sequence GUG into GAG (designated GAG) and triple-base mutation that predicts to disrupt the stem structure (Stem disrupt). A control, double mutation that is predicted not to affect the stem structure was also introduced (Stem unchanged) (Fig 4A). All mutations were introduced into the genomic loci by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) [33,34], and Sanger sequencing confirmed that no other nucleotide in the gene was affected. Importantly, all the introduced mutations were silent and therefore did not affect the encoded HisRS protein. RT-qPCR analysis revealed minor changes in the abundance of the transcript in any of the mutants (Fig 4B). However, RIP followed by RT-qPCR revealed a significant decrease in the association of HisRS with the GAG-containing transcript and with the transcript with disrupted stem. Importantly, the mutations that did not change the stem did not affect the association with HisRS (Fig 4C).\n\nTo further substantiate the validity of this putative anticodon mimic, we designed a reciprocal experiment in which the mRNA was pulled down and the levels of its associated HisRS protein was determined. For that, each of the four mRNA variant (wild-type [WT], GAG mutation, stem disruption, and stem unchanged) was tagged at its 3' UTR with multiple MS2 loops and expressed together with a plasmid expressing MS2-binding protein fused to GFP (MS2BP-GFP). Transcripts were isolated on GFP-Trap columns by virtue of their association with the MS2BP-GFP fusion (Fig 4D). Western analysis for the levels of associated HisRS (tagged with 6xHIS) are presented in Fig 4E. These signals were quantified and normalized to the amounts of pulled-down HisRS-MS2 loops mRNAs (measured by a parallel RT-qPCR) to account for variation in pull down efficiencies (Fig 4F). The results are in clear concordance with the RIP assay. Namely, high association of HisRS with the WT transcript, reduced association with the GAG and stem disruption, and higher association with the unchanged-stem mutant transcript (Fig 4F). Together, these results show that HisRS binds its mRNA and validate the importance of an anticodon-like element for binding.\n\nBinding to the putative anticodon GUG represses HisRS translation\n\nHisRS binding to its own mRNA might play a post-transcriptional regulatory role. Since transcript levels of the WT and the mutated variants are similar (Fig 4B), we hypothesized that impact is at the translation level. To address this, we performed polysomal association analysis for the WT and anticodon GAG mutation variant. optical density at 254 nm (OD254) profile of polysomal distribution in sucrose gradients did not reveal any general difference between the WT and GAG-containing strains (Fig 5A). Gradients were fractionated and RNA was isolated from each fraction and subjected to northern analysis with probes recognizing the HisRS mRNA or Actin control. An increase in ribosomal association (in particular fractions 9 and 10) and a decrease in nonribosomal (fractions 3–6) is observed for the anticodon GAG variant compared to the WT transcript. No significant change is observed for Actin (Fig 5B). We also measured protein synthesis by pulse labeling of proteins by adding L- [35S]-methionine (35S-met) to the growth medium of both strains. Aliquots were collected at different time points after addition, lysed, and subjected to PAGE autoradiography either directly (Total proteins) or after isolation of HisRS-GFP by GFP-Trap beads (Fig 5C). Overall protein synthesis appeared similar for both strains (Fig 5C), indicating that the silent mutation did not lead to general effects on translation. However, the synthesis of the GAG-containing HisRS appeared higher after 30-min or longer labeling (Fig 5C). Biological repeats of a 30-min pulse revealed a 40% increase in HisRS protein that is made from the GAG variant (Fig 5D). We note that the nucleotide change that was introduced (U to A) changes the wobble position of a GGU codon into GGA. GGA has a lower codon bias index than GGU; hence, it is unlikely that the increased translation of the GAG variant is due to a change in codon bias. These results therefore suggest that the increased translation of HisRS is due to relief of a translation inhibition imposed by binding of HisRS to the GUG region.\n\nTo explore if inhibition can occur in trans, we introduced plasmids expressing ABD-GFP or CD-GFP into cells either endogenously expressing the WT HisRS or the GAG variant. Cells were subjected to pulse labeling, followed by immunoisolation of the endogenously expressed HisRS. As can be seen in Fig 5E, introducing the ABD-GFP repressed the synthesis of HisRS compared to CD-GFP. Importantly, the impact of ABD-GFP on translation was not detected in the GAG HisRS variant. Thus, interaction between the ABD and the anticodon mimic is critical for inhibition.\n\nBinding regulates HisRS translation in response to tRNAHis levels\n\nThe association of HisRS with its own mRNA through a tRNAHis anticodon mimic may offer a regulatory mechanism, which coordinates mRNA translation with tRNA availability. To address this in vivo, we subjected cells to starvation of histidine (by the addition of 3 aminotriazole [3AT]), a stress condition known to increase the levels of uncharged tRNAHis [35,36]. RT-qPCR analysis of expression levels revealed a small increase in steady-state mRNA levels of HisRS, suggesting some regulation at the transcription level (Fig 6A). Nevertheless, binding efficiency of HisRS to the mRNA is significantly reduced upon this treatment (Fig 6B). Furthermore, protein synthesis measurements by 35S-met pulse labeling revealed that HisRS protein synthesis rate is significantly higher upon histidine depletion (Fig 6C). Biological replicates for a 90-min pulse time revealed a 50% increase in synthesis (Fig 6D). Importantly, this translation enhancement is diminished in the GAG and stem disruption mutants, yet apparent in the unchanged stem variant of HisRS (Fig 6D). Thus, binding to the putative anticodon mimic is critical for translation regulation.\n\nTo pinpoint the observed changes to an increase in tRNAHis levels, we introduced into HisRS-GFP strain a plasmid that overexpresses tRNAHis about 5-fold higher than normal (Fig 7A). tRNA overexpression did not affect steady-state levels of HisRS mRNA (Fig 7B). Importantly, HisRS RIP analysis followed by RT-qPCR revealed a strong decrease in mRNA self-association (Fig 7C), which occurred concomitantly with an increase in tRNA association (Fig 7D). Analysis of protein synthesis by 35S-met pulse labeling revealed that the decreased mRNA binding coincides with increased HisRS protein synthesis, without an effect on overall translation (Fig 7E and 7F). These results indicate a direct linkage between increased tRNA acylation demands, decreased mRNA binding and increased HisRS protein synthesis.\n\nDiscussion\n\naaRSs bind their own mRNA\n\nThe data presented herein reveals an autogenous association between every tested aaRS and its mRNA. This implies a general post-transcriptional autoregulatory process for this family of RBPs. Other RBPs are also known to be subjected to autoregulation in S. cerevisiae. Some ribosomal proteins were found to bind their own mRNA [37–39]. Here, binding appeared to affect the splicing of these mRNAs and thereby regulate their expression. Self-association appears also for bona fide mRNA-binding proteins; the mRNA targets of 46 mRBPs were characterized [40], and 18 of them appeared to be highly associated with their own mRNA [41]. Thus, we propose that self-association with their mRNA is an abundant feature of the RNA-binding proteome.\n\nPossible expression-regulation mechanisms\n\nPost-transcriptional autoregulation by RBPs may occur at various stages. As indicated above, ribosomal proteins usually regulate their splicing process. In the case of AspRS, regulation was shown to occur at the step of mRNA export from the nucleus [42]. Our work indicates regulation by RBP at the step of translation. The exact mechanisms of translation regulation are yet to be explored. One possibility is that HisRS binding affects translation initiation and ribosomal loading. Our polysomal data (Fig 5) reveal that reduced mRNA binding by HisRS results in a decrease in ribosome-free mRNA and an increase in polysomal mRNA. Such changes are consistent with a role in translation initiation. On the other hand, the binding site of HisRS is within its coding region, suggesting regulation at the elongation step of translation. HisRS binding may slow ribosomal transit at this region, as was shown to occur upon binding of the neuronal RBP fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMRP) to some mRNAs [43]. Yet analysis of Ribo-seq mapping results in the genome-wide information on protein synthesis (GWIPS)-vis site did not reveal any accumulation of ribosomes upstream to the anticodon mimic. Furthermore, 3AT treatment did not reveal any gross changes in ribosome footprint on this area of HisRS mRNA [44]. An alternative mode of elongation regulation may involve association of the aaRS with the nascent protein chains as they emerge from ribosomes (i.e., cotranslational). Such mode of regulation was shown recently to coordinate the assembly of protein complexes [28]. In the case of MetRS:Arc1:GluRS, our data support this model and expand it. Specifically, the reduction in GluRS mRNA levels upon deletion of Arc1 from the MetRS-GFP strain indicates that complex formation is important for partner mRNA isolation. However, the fact that self-association is hardly affected from Arc1 deletion suggests an additional interaction mode that is independent of complex assembly. Together, we suggest that MetRS and GluRS regulate each other's expression in a cotranslational, complex-dependent manner, yet regulate their own expression through direct binding to their mRNA and not through their nascent chain. Interestingly, none of the proteins that were presented in detail in [28] (Fas1, Fas2, GluRS, MetRS, Arc1, Trp2, Trp3, Pfk1, Pfk2) appeared to associate with its own nascent chain. We therefore propose that a complete model for complex assembly entails, in addition to association with partners’ nascent chain, also direct association with self mRNA. Notably, Pfk2 was also shown to bind its own mRNA [10], suggesting that this occurs also in the Phosphofructokinase complex.\n\nAutogenous regulation of expression by tRNA mimic\n\nThe data presented here reveal a post-transcriptional autogenous regulation mechanism that is suggested to utilize similar RNA moieties. Such a mechanism was proposed years ago for the E. coli HisRS by Ames B. and colleagues, following an observation of a tRNAHis-like structure at the operator region [45]. The predicted structure of the element that we identified herein shows some resemblance to the anticodon moiety of tRNAHis, and our mutagenesis results are consistent with the structure prediction. Further support for similarity with tRNAHis anticodon loop is derived from the fact that HisRS binds this element through the same domain that it binds the tRNAHis anticodon (i.e., the ABD). It should be noted, however, that due to the presence of the putative anticodon mimic within the coding region, we were limited in our ability to perform comprehensive mutagenesis analysis without affecting the encoded protein. Thus, an unequivocal confirmation of structural mimicry will necessitate other means. For example, in vitro interaction assays with purified components or introducing the putative element upstream to a reporter gene, followed by mutagenesis analysis of predicted structures. Such approaches were applied in studies of the E. coli ThrRS and revealed an operator region that post-transcriptionally controls ThrRS expression [46] through autogenous binding to a tRNA-like region within it [22,47,48]. Protein binding blocks ribosomes’ association and thereby represses ThrRS translation initiation. tRNA-like structures were also found to be important for S. cerevisiae AspRS self-association [23,49]. Thus, binding through RNA mimicry might be a general property of aaRS. Binding through RNA structural mimicry is actually well-established for most ribosomal proteins in E. coli. Structural elements within the operators of E. coli ribosomal protein genes resemble the binding sites of these proteins within rRNA [50,51]. Thus, when ribosomal proteins are at access to rRNA (i.e., are not bound to rRNA), they bind these operators and repress ribosome binding. Together, RNA mimicry might be a general mechanism by which RBPs coordinate different cellular processes.\n\nRegulation by levels of uncharged tRNA\n\nWe presented here evidence that changes in the amounts of tRNAHis affect the translation of HisRS. Specifically, depletion of histidine (Fig 6) and overexpression of tRNAHis (Fig 7) led to an increased synthesis of HisRS. Increased levels of uncharged tRNAHis induce broad changes in gene expression through activation of the amino acids starvation pathway. The activation mechanism includes binding of tRNAHis to a domain in Gcn2 that is similar to HisRS, leading to activation of the kinase domain within the protein [52,53]. Gcn2 in turn activates the synthesis of the transcription regulator Gcn4 and thereby allows proper response to cellular needs. Our model for HisRS activation (Fig 8) suggests a direct mechanism, in which tRNAHis binds directly to HisRS, and relieves the inhibition it imposes on translation. Thus, excess of uncharged tRNAHis may operate in two ways: binding to Gcn2 to activate the general amino acid starvation pathway and binding to HisRS to induce its translation. The increased HisRS synthesis leads to higher amounts of the enzyme, which are necessary to account for the increased charging demands.\n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, we found that in vivo, aaRSs preferentially bind their own mRNA. These proteins are therefore tRNA and mRNA binders. This dual binding property allows coordination between tRNA charging and mRNA translation and, more generally, between translation and gene expression. We also show that for HisRS, binding occurs through a putative anticodon mimic. As anticodon recognition is central for tRNA binding by most aaRSs, we propose that recognition through anticodon-like elements will be a prevalent mode of interaction by most aaRS. Single-nucleotide resolution mapping strategies are necessary to confirm this and, in particular, methodologies that combine structural analysis. Such approaches are especially necessary in cases in which the aaRS interacts with multiple anticodons and therefore is likely to recognize various elements along the mRNA. Further, we show that mRNA binding leads to translation inhibition, and the mechanisms by which binding impacts ribosomal association are yet to be uncovered. Finally, we demonstrated that regulation involves competitive association of the aaRS with its target tRNA and mRNA. These results reveal a new mechanism for communicating gene expression with tRNA charging (Fig 8) in which a single RBP coordinates distinct cellular processes.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nYeast strains, plasmids, and growth conditions\n\nThe following yeast strains were used: endogenously TAP-tagged (TAP-His3MX) MES1 (MetRS), GUS1 (GluRS), VAS1 (ValRS), and HTS1 (HisRS) were all in the following genetic background (ATCC 201388: MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) [54], and endogenously GFP-tagged (GFP [S65T]-His3MX) GLN4 (GlnRS), and HTS1 (HisRS) were all on the following background (ATCC 201388: MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) [55]. Proper fusion and expression of the tags were verified by PCR and western analysis. Knockout of ARC1 was done in the MetRS-TAP background by homologous recombination using a LEU2 cassette amplified from pRS405, as describe in [56].\n\nPlasmids expressing CD-GFP and ABD-GFP were generated by PCR amplification of nts 1–1,281 (for CD) and 1,281–1,641 (for ABD) and cloning upstream to enhanced GFP (eGFP). The HisRS domain-eGFP fragment was cloned into the vector backbone of pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene) by replacing the GAL4-AD region. Plasmids were introduced into BY4741 cells and grown in SC with the appropriate drop outs. Western analysis confirmed similar expression of the two fusion proteins.\n\ntRNAHis expression plasmid (2 μ, LEU2), containing the tRNAHis (GUG) (tH[GUG]G2) mature sequence [57] and empty vector control, were introduced into HisRS-GFP strain and grown in SC with the appropriate dropout.\n\nRIP\n\nStrains (either TAP or GFP tagged) were grown in YPD to mid logarithmic phase and subjected to cross-linking by addition of formaldehyde (0.05% final concentration) for 10 min at room temp. Cross-linking was terminated with 0.125 M glycine for 3 min, and cells were lysed using bead beater in Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml Leupeptin, 14 μg/ml Pepstatin, 0.02 U/μl RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega), 0.24 U/μl RiboLock RNase Inhibitor [Thermo Scientific]). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,600 g for 10 min at 4°C. For isolation of TAP-tagged proteins, lysates were loaded on proteinA-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare 17-0969-01) and rotated at 4°C for 2 hr. Samples were washed four times in Buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 M NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.01 U/μl RiboLock RNase Inhibitor [Thermo Scientific]) and subjected to cleavage with 80 U of TEV (Invitrogen 12575–015) for 2 hr at 16°C in TEV buffer. Cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65°C for 2 hr in reverse cross-linking buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 1% SDS, 0.1 U/μl RiboLock RNase Inhibitor [Thermo Scientific]), and RNA was precipitated after phenol:choloroform extraction. For isolation of GFP-tagged proteins, lysates were loaded on GFP-Trap_A (ChromoTek) and rotated at 4°C for 2 hr. Samples were washed four times in Buffer C and eluted by 0.2 M Glycine buffer (pH 2.5). Cross-linking reversal and RNA isolation was done as described above for TAP-tagged sample.\n\nUV–RNA cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)\n\nGFP-tagged strains were grown in YPD to mid logarithmic phase, subjected to UV cross-linking (1.2 J/cm2 of 254 nm) on ice. Cells were lysed using bead beater in buffer B and immunoprecipitation was conducted as described above. Cross-linking was reversed by 0.8 U/ μl proteinase K (NEB P8107S) at 50°C for 1 hr in PK Buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA), and RNA was precipitated after phenol:choloroform extraction.\n\nRNA quantification methods\n\nRNA samples were subjected to RNA-seq at the Technion Genome Center. Libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, California, United States of America) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polyA selection step was excluded for the Bound samples to minimize losses. All samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, yielding 10 to 18 million reads per sample. The reads were mapped to the S288c Saccharomyces cerevisiae version R64-2-1 genome using Tophat2 version 2.1.0 with up to three mismatches allowed per read. Only uniquely mapped reads were counted to genes using HTSeq-count package version 0.6.1.\n\nFor semiquantitative PCR, cDNA was prepared from 500 ng RNA by High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Maxima) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and subjected to PCR with gene-specific primers (S5 Table). Aliquots were set aside every five cycles, run on agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. For RT-qPCR, RNA was reverse transcribed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Maxima) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific transcription levels were determined in a 25-μl reaction volume in triplicate using qPCR master mix (Applied Biosystem cat. 4367659), following the manufacturer's instructions using primers for the indicated genes (S5 Table). Results were analyzed with 7500 software v2.0.6 program.\n\nRNA pull-down\n\nStrains expressing HisRS mRNA variants (WT, GAG, Stem disrupt, and Stem unchange) tagged at the 3' UTR with multiple MS2 loops and expressing pCP-GFP [58] were grown to logarithmic phase (OD600 0.8–1) in 500 ml. For RNA “Input” sample, 10 ml were set aside, and RNA were extracted by the hot phenol method [59]. The remainder of cells (490 ml) were subjected to cross-linking by addition of formaldehyde (0.05% final concentration) in PBS and slowly rotated at room temperature for 10 min to cross-link protein–RNA complexes. 0.125 M Glycine was added to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were then suspended in 1 ml cold buffer B (with 5 mg/ml Heparin final concentration). Cells were lysed and cleared as in RIP method. Aliquot (1/20 of the lysate) were set aside for proteins' “Input” sample. Lysates were loaded on GFP-Trap_A (ChromoTek) and rotated at 4°C for 2 hr. Samples were washed four times in wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.01 U/μl RiboLock RNase Inhibitor [Thermo Scientific]). Proteins were eluted from 80% of the beads with LSB and resolved on 10% PAGE. RNA was extracted from 20% of the beads by 0.2 M Glycine buffer (pH 2.5). Cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65°C for 2 hr in reverse cross-linking buffer, and RNA was precipitated after phenol:choloroform extraction.\n\nfRIP\n\nHisRS-GFP strain was grown in YPD to mid logarithmic phase and subjected to cross-linking by addition of formaldehyde (0.1% final concentration) for 10 min at room temp. Cross-linking was terminated with 0.125 M glycine for 3 min, and cells were lysed in Buffer B. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,600 g at 4°C and fragmented by 0.2 U/μl RNase I (LifeTech, AM2295), with shaking for 4 min at 37°C. Samples were loaded on GFP-Trap_A (ChromoTek) for 2 hr at 4°C, and washed four times in Buffer C. Proteins were eluted by 0.2 M Glycine buffer (pH 2.5). Cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65°C for 16 hr in reverse cross-linking buffer and RNA was precipitated following phenol:choloroform extraction. For semiquantitative PCR, cDNA was prepared by High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Maxima) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to 14 PCR reactions with specific primers that designed to cover the entire HisRS transcript. Aliquots were set aside every five cycles, run on agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9 point mutagenesis\n\nPoint mutations by the CRISPR/Cas9 were introduced according to protocol [33]. Briefly, plasmids expressing guideRNA recognizing the mutation region in bRA66 (Addgene #100952) backbone was transformed into HisRS-GFP strain together with double-stranded 80-bp DNA fragment that contains the desired mutation at its center. Transformants were grown on YP-Gal Hygromycin (200 μg/ml) plate to induce Cas9 expression. Control transformation without the 80-bp DNA fragment did not yield any viable colony, indicating that the double-strand break induced by the guideRNA is lethal. Viable clones from the transformation with the 80 bp fragment were isolated, and the HisRS gene was sequenced. All included only a single change at the desired site. The exact positions of mutations are GAG mutant: T1101A; Stem disrupt: T1098A, C1104A, C1107A; Stem unchanged: T1098C, C1104T.\n\nMS2 loops tagging of HisRS\n\nPlasmid expressing guideRNA recognizing GFP (S65T) sequence in bRA66 (Addgene #100952) backbone was transformed into either HisRS-GFP WT, GAG, Stem disrupt, or Stem unchanged strains together with PCR product amplified from pSL-MS2-12X (Addgene #27119) using HisRS MS2L F and HisRS MS2L primers (S5 Table). Note that the MS2L F primer also includes 6XHIS, thus adds 6XHIS in frame to HisRS before its stop codon. Transformants were grown on YP-Gal Hygromycin (200 μg/ml) plate to induce Cas9 expression. Clones were isolated, and the tagging at the genomic locus were validated by sequencing.\n\n35S methionine pulse labeling\n\nCells (10 ml) were grown to mid-log phase in SC, washed, and resuspended in 10 ml SC-met. Growth was continued for another 5 min, 35S methionine (NEG709A005MC, PerkinElmer) was added, and 2-ml aliquots were set into cycloheximide (100 μg/ml final concentration) at the indicated times. Labeled HisRS-GFP was immunoprecipitated with GFP-Trap_A (ChromoTek) by incubation at 4°C for 2 hr and washed four times in Buffer C. Proteins were eluted from the beads with LSB, resolved on 10% PAGE, and exposed to phosphorimager. Radioactive signals were quantified by ImageJ.\n\nPolysomal profiles\n\nPolysome analysis was done as described [60]. Briefly, 100-ml cells were grown to mid-log phase, cycloheximide was added, and cells were harvested in Lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl [pH 7.4], 140 mM KCl,1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide,1 mg/ml heparin, 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were cleared by 10 min centrifugation at 9,000 g, and loaded on 10%–50% linear sucrose gradient. Polysomal complexes were resolved by 160 min centrifugation at 35,000 rpm in SW41 rotor and separated into 12 fractions with ISCO UA6 device. RNA was extracted from each fraction and analyzed by northern blot with probes for HisRS or Actin mRNAs [61].\n\nSupporting information"
