  "fullText": "Since publication of this paper, the authors became aware of details in the preparation of a composite figure that required correction.\n\nIn the previous version of Figure 2, a segment within a cortical cell close to the shootward end of panel 2D1 was processed to match between overlapping images, which does not fully comply with image processing standards. We have reconstructed all composite panels in the corrected Figure 2 from the raw data to ensure that the figure is now fully compliant. In this process, we have slightly shifted the positioning of some inset boxes for an improved positional match with the high magnification images they are referring to. None of these changes affect the results and conclusions reported in the paper in any way. The correction version has been provided here."
