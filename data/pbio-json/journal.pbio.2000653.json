  "abstract": "The actin cytoskeleton coordinates the organization of signaling microclusters at the immune synapse (IS); however, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We show here that nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) controls the coalescence of protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS. eNOS translocated with the Golgi to the IS and partially colocalized with F-actin around the c-SMAC. This resulted in reduced actin polymerization and centripetal retrograde flow of β-actin and PKC-θ from the lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC, promoting PKC-θ activation. Furthermore, eNOS-derived NO S-nitrosylated β-actin on Cys374 and impaired actin binding to profilin-1 (PFN1), as confirmed with the transnitrosylating agent S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO). The importance of NO and the formation of PFN1-actin complexes on the regulation of PKC-θ was corroborated by overexpression of PFN1- and actin-binding defective mutants of β-actin (C374S) and PFN1 (H119E), respectively, which reduced the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC. These findings unveil a novel NO-dependent mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton controls the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nNitric oxide (NO) is a free radical that is highly reactive against transition metals in prosthetic groups, Cys, and Tyr of proteins whose activity can be regulated by nitrosylation and nitration [1,2]. As a signaling molecule, NO exerts important regulatory functions in T cells [3]. In mice, low levels of NO favor T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation through a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent mechanism, whereas high levels of NO from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) prevents Th1 and Th17 responses [4,5]. Conversely, in humans, the induction and stability of Th17 responses have been associated with iNOS-produced NO [6], making evident the functional differences described for NO between the murine and human systems [7].\n\nIn steady-state conditions, human T cell lines and primary T lymphocytes express endothelial (e)NOS, which is chiefly localized on the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)-associated Golgi, producing NO upon T cell receptor (TCR)-triggering and providing pro-activatory signals at the immune synapse (IS) [8,9], a plasma membrane–associated intercellular compartment of adhesion and signaling found in T cells during their antigen-specific interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [10,11]. The IS is organized in a central area or supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) in which the signaling molecule CD3 concentrates, a ring-shaped peripheral (p)-SMAC where the β2 integrin LFA-1 clusters with talin and actin, and a lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC characterized by a ring of F-actin [12]. Among its functions, the IS modulates T cell activation, acting as a rheostat to attenuate or sustain signaling by degradation of TCR–ligand complexes at the c-SMAC or positioning signaling microclusters at the p-SMAC, respectively. [13–15]\n\nProtein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ), a novel protein kinase C preferentially expressed in T lymphocytes, activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through phosphorylation of CARD-containing MAGUK protein 1 (CARMA1) and assembly of the CARMA1–BCL10–MALT1 complex, participates in the differentiation of Th2 and Th17 cells [16], localizes at the c-SMAC, and is involved in the translocation of the MTOC towards the IS where PKC-θ forms a ring-shaped area of signaling near the p-SMAC [17,18]. The localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS depends on several factors, including its association with diacylglycerol (DAG) and CD28, phosphorylation on Thr538 by the MAP4K germinal center kinase-like kinase (GLK), sumoylation, and the reorganization of actin [19–23].\n\nIn T cells, actin allows TCR triggering, supports receptor-mediated intercellular adhesion, maintains the association of signaling microclusters, and organizes the spatial distribution of signaling receptors, adaptors, and kinases at the IS by centripetal retrograde flow-mediated transport of microclusters towards the c-SMAC, a process achieved by actin treadmilling at the d-SMAC [13,24,25]. Although a large body of evidence points to the actin cytoskeleton as the main organizer of signaling molecules at the IS, besides findings based on either pharmacological agents disturbing actin dynamics or the interference on the function of the actin nucleator Arp2/3 and its regulation by nucleation-promoting elements such as WAVE2 and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) [26–29], little is known about how β-actin itself takes part in the mechanisms that orchestrate the flow of signaling microclusters towards the c-SMAC.\n\nWe have previously shown that eNOS impairs the clustering of CD3 at the c-SMAC [8], suggesting that NO may regulate the organization and activation of signaling molecules at the IS. In this work, we have investigated the mechanism by which NO may exert this regulation. Focusing on PKC-θ as a c-SMAC hallmark, we show that eNOS-derived NO controls the organization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS, a result confirmed in studies using the NO donor, S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO). In antigen-specific T cell-APC conjugates, eNOS translocated to the IS, colocalizing with F-actin, fostering actin depolymerization, and reducing actin retrograde and PKC-θ inward flow from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC. Mechanistic insights are provided by demonstrating that NO regulates the organization of PKC-θ by S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374, a posttranslational modification that, disturbing the binding of actin to PFN1, controls the organization of the actin cytoskeleton from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC.\n\nResults\n\neNOS regulates the recruitment and localization of PKC-θ at the IS\n\nTo explore the role played by eNOS in the organization of signaling microclusters at the IS, we analyzed the localization of PKC-θ in conjugates between Raji B cells pulsed with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and TCR Vβ3–expressing CH7C17 Jurkat T cells, stably transfected with either eNOS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (eNOS) or its inactive cytoplasmic G2A mutant (G2A) [30–32] (Fig 1). PKC-θ concentrated at the c-SMAC in 40%–50% of control CH7C17 and G2A T cells, whereas its coalescence to this area was reduced by half in eNOS T cells, a reduction also observed for CD28 (Fig 1A and S1 Fig). X–Z plane projections of the IS and their corresponding fluorescence profiles illustrate in more detail the scattered distribution of PKC-θ and CD28 at the IS of eNOS T cells (Fig 1A and S1 Fig). Moreover, the localization of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC of eNOS T cells was restored by the silencing of eNOS (S2A Fig), which reduced NO production to levels similar to those found in T lymphoblasts, parental, and eNOS T cells treated with the NOS inhibitor Nitro-L-Arg-methyl-ester (L-NAME) (S2B Fig). Furthermore, L-NAME increased the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC of primary human T lymphoblasts (S2C Fig).\n\nIn an attempt to explore whether eNOS regulates the localization of PKC-θ from the IS, we analyzed the position of eNOS and the area and fluorescence of PKC-θ in SEB-specific T cell–APC conjugates. Data revealed that the distance of Golgi-associated eNOS to the IS inversely correlated with the area occupied by PKC-θ, a finding less easily observed in golgin-97–labeled G2A T cells (Fig 1B). The regulation exerted by eNOS on the localization of PKC-θ at the IS did not seem merely attributed to plasma membrane changes since the area occupied by the IS-independent T cell marker CD7 at the T cell–APC contact site did not differ among eNOS, G2A, and parental CH7C17 T cells (S3 Fig). Furthermore, fluorescence intensity from PKC-θ in the IS was higher in eNOS than in G2A T cells (Fig 1C). Those results were corroborated in live eNOS T cells transfected with PKC-θ-monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) (Fig 1D and 1E). The action exerted by eNOS on the localization of PKC-θ was also assessed in CH7C17 T cells knocked-out for endogenous eNOS through a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, in which NO production as response to TCR triggering is severely impaired (S4 Fig). Although no significant differences were found among control and two eNOS knockout (KO) CH7C17 T cell clones regarding the percentage of cells bearing PKC-θ concentrated at the c-SMAC, both the amounts and area of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC were considerably lower in eNOS KO than in control CH7C17 T cells (Fig 2A–2C). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the recruitment and localization of PKC-θ at the IS is regulated by the compartmentalized activity of eNOS near the IS.\n\neNOS partially colocalizes with F-actin at the IS and controls TCR-triggered actin polymerization\n\nA direct interaction between eNOS and F-actin has been previously reported [33]. To study whether eNOS controls the localization of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC from the actin cytoskeleton, we analyzed F-actin in SEB-specific conjugates between Raji APCs and eNOS or G2A T cells. Plasma membrane–associated eNOS-GFP, but neither G2A-GFP nor Golgi-associated eNOS-GFP, codistributed with F-actin around the c-SMAC, and the levels of F-actin at the IS were lower in eNOS than in G2A T cells (Fig 3A). To avoid the interference of F-actin from APCs, the localization of eNOS and F-actin was also assessed in T cells settled on anti-CD3 Ab-coated coverslips (Fig 3B). No broad differences were found among the cell types studied regarding gross cell morphology and spreading (Fig 3B, upper right graph); however, whereas the lamellipodium of CH7C17 and G2A T cells showed a well-conformed F-actin–rich border, a less organized array of F-actin was observed in eNOS T cells (Fig 3B). Of note, endogenous eNOS and eNOS-GFP partially colocalized with F-actin (Fig 3B, lower right graph), suggesting that, upon TCR triggering, eNOS would be involved in the control of actin polymerization and lamellipodium organization. To test this, we analyzed the content of eNOS and β-actin in Triton X-100 (TX-100)–soluble and–insoluble/cytoskeletal fractions from CH7C17, G2A, and eNOS T cells. In steady-state conditions, G2A mainly associated with the soluble fraction. In contrast, endogenous eNOS and eNOS-GFP distributed between soluble and cytoskeletal fractions, increasing in the latter upon TCR-engagement (Fig 3C). Interestingly, β-actin increased in cytoskeletal fractions from CH7C17 and G2A T cells stimulated with CD3 Ab, reaching lower levels in eNOS T cells (Fig 3D)—an action dependent on eNOS-derived NO since both the interference of eNOS and its inhibition with L-NAME increased the levels of F-actin in CD3-stimulated eNOS T cells (Fig 3E).\n\nWe also assessed the presence of PKC-θ in TX-100–insoluble cell fractions. A small but significant amount of PKC-θ was recruited to the cytoskeleton in response to TCR engagement and this increased by overexpression of eNOS (Fig 3F), an effect depending on actin since the pretreatment of cells with the actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin D diminished the recruitment of both eNOS-GFP and PKC-θ to the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig 3G).\n\nThese results indicate that eNOS translocates to the actin cytoskeleton and controls actin polymerization in response to TCR engagement, which may regulate the recruitment of PKC-θ to the IS.\n\neNOS controls F-actin clearance and the inward flow of actin and PKC-θ at the IS\n\nTo explore whether eNOS-derived NO regulates the spatio-temporal organization of actin at the IS, LifeAct-enhanced GFP (EGFP)–transfected control and eNOS KO T cells were loaded with the NO probe DAR-4M AM, and the fluorescence of F-actin and the release of NO near the IS were simultaneously captured every 17.74 s by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig 4A and 4B). We found that, within the first 35 s from the establishment of initial cell contacts with APCs, both control and eNOS KO T cells similarly accumulate F-actin across the IS (Fig 4A and 4B, S1 and S2 Movies). However, whereas the F-actin levels at the central area of control T cells were progressively reduced within the next 1–3 min, the clearance of F-actin in eNOS KO T cells was considerably delayed, and after 5 min, F-actin progressively accumulated at the central area of eNOS KO but not control T cells, the latter showing a more apparent F-actin–rich ring-shaped d-SMAC (Fig 4A and 4B, S1 and S2 Movies). Regarding NO, its levels near the IS progressively increased from the establishment of initial cell contacts, reaching higher levels in control that in eNOS KO CH7C17 T cells (Fig 4A and 4B, S1 and S2 Movies).\n\nThe kinetics of actin polymerization in eNOS and G2A T cells were also investigated (Fig 4C–4F). Flow cytometry analysis of phalloidin-labeled F-actin in cells stimulated for 15 min on CD3 Ab-coated surfaces showed two well-defined phases: (i) a burst of actin polymerization that reached maximum values around the first minute of stimulation, followed by (ii), a more extended low rate of depolymerization that after 15 min returned F-actin to near basal levels (Fig 4C). Strikingly, whereas the burst of actin polymerization was similar in eNOS and G2A T cells, actin-depolymerization was accelerated in eNOS T cells, maintaining lower levels of F-actin relative to G2A T cells (Fig 4C). To visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of β-actin in eNOS and G2A T cells, we transfected them with an mCherry-β-actin low copy expression plasmid [34] and performed time-lapse speckle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) upon activation on CD3 Ab-coated coverslips. Cells spread within the first minute, forming characteristic β-actin–rich lamellipodia that were more obvious and dynamic in G2A than in eNOS T cells (Fig 4D and S3 Movie). Next, by kymograph analyses, we compared the retrograde flow of mCherry-β-actin in the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC of TCR-engaged CH7C17, eNOS, and G2A T cells. β-actin moved inward slower in eNOS than in CH7C17 or G2A T cells (average rates of 0.052, 0.104, and 0.092 μm s-1, respectively) (Fig 4E and 4F). Additionally, tracking of PKC-θ-mRFP in cells stimulated on CD3 Ab showed that microclusters of PKC-θ concentrated at a central area in G2A T cells but distributed peripherally in eNOS T cells (Fig 4G, S4 and S5 Movies).\n\nOverall, these results indicate that eNOS controls the actin cytoskeleton at the IS, fostering early and sustained F-actin clearance at the central area but reducing the centripetal retrograde flow of actin and the inward movement of PKC-θ microclusters from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC.\n\neNOS increases the activation of PKC-θ in T cells\n\nMicrocluster signaling is generated and sustained at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC [12,35]. The persistence of PKC-θ in the peripheral region of eNOS-overexpressing T cells led us to examine its activation state. Phosphorylation of PKC-θ on Thr538, as a response to stimulation with CD3 Ab, was higher in eNOS than in either G2A or CH7C17 T cells (Fig 5A). The specific action of eNOS on the phosphorylation of PKC-θ was corroborated by its knockdown, which broadly reduced endogenous expression of eNOS and TCR-triggered phosphorylation of PKC-θ in parental CH7C17 T cells and primary human T lymphoblasts (Fig 5B–5D). Similarly, upon stimulation with SEB-pulsed APCs, knockdown of eNOS reduced PKC-θ phosphorylation in eNOS T cells but not in G2A T cells (Fig 5E and S5 Fig).\n\nTo assess the functional impact of the regulation of PKC-θ by eNOS, we analyzed the NF-κB pathway in eNOS and G2A T cells stimulated with CD3 Ab (Fig 5F), focusing on CARMA1, IκB, and IκB kinase (IKK), as well known components of the TCR-triggered cascade of NF-kB activation [36]. Phosphorylation of CARMA1 on Ser652, a PKC-θ target equivalent to Ser657 in mouse cells [37], IKKα/β, and IκBα were enhanced in eNOS with respect to G2A T cells (Fig 5F).\n\nThese results indicate that eNOS positively regulates the activation of PKC-θ at the IS.\n\neNOS-derived NO regulates PKC-θ localization and activation through a cGMP-independent mechanism\n\nThe above results prompted us to explore the mechanisms by which eNOS controls the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC, focusing on soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) as one of the most sensitive NO targets in cells. Neither 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a potent inhibitor of sGC, nor 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cGMP), a cGMP analogue, exerted any significant effect on the activation of PKC-θ in eNOS T cells stimulated with CD3 Abs (Fig 6A). Furthermore, neither the dispersed distribution of PKC-θ at the IS of eNOS T cells nor its concentrated localization at the c-SMAC of G2A T cells were significantly altered by ODQ and 8Br-cGMP, respectively (Fig 6B and 6C). On the contrary, treatment of G2A T cells with Cys-NO, an NO donor that bears transnitrosylating activity, disturbed the localization of PKC-θ at the IS, irrespective of whether cells were pretreated with ODQ (Fig 6B and 6C). These results were validated in primary human T lymphoblasts. Cys-NO treatment increased the fluorescence from PKC-θ at the IS but impaired its coalescence to the c-SMAC of superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE)-specific T cell–APC conjugates (Fig 6D–6F), and increased PKC-θ phosphorylation but decreased F-actin levels upon CD3 stimulation (Fig 6G and 6H).\n\nThese findings indicate that eNOS-derived NO regulates the activation and organization of PKC-θ at the IS via a cGMP-independent mechanism that may involve protein S-nitrosylation.\n\neNOS stimulates β-actin S-nitrosylation on Cys374 upon TCR-triggering\n\nβ-actin is among the major S-nitrosylated proteins detected in cells stimulated with NO [38]. To investigate whether eNOS S-nitrosylates β-actin in T cells, we performed biotin-switch assays, which consist of the specific biotinylation of proteins bearing S-nitrosylated Cys after the irreversible blockage of non-nitrosylated Cys. S-nitrosylation of β-actin increased in primary human T lymphoblasts stimulated with CD3 Ab (Fig 7A) and also in eNOS T cells stimulated with SEB-pulsed Raji APCs (Fig 7B), in which S-nitrosylation of β-actin was greatly reduced by knockdown of eNOS (Fig 7C).\n\nFour Cys nearest to the C-terminus of β-actin: Cys 257, 272, 285, and 374, have been identified as targets of hyperoxia-induced S-nitrosylation in neutrophils [39]. To study whether one or more of these Cys were S-nitrosylated in T cells as a response to TCR triggering, we performed proteomic studies (Fig 7D). Cell extracts from eNOS T cells stimulated with SEB-pulsed Raji APCs were subjected to a nitrosothiol-specific assay similar to the biotin switch, with N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) blocking agent but using the alkylating agent iodoacetamide (IAM) instead of HPDP-biotin to improve the fragmentation quality in mass spectrometry data from β-actin–derived peptides. We found that Cys257 was very poorly S-nitrosylated, and S-nitrosylation of Cys285 was higher, but changed slightly upon stimulation (Fig 7D). Regarding Cys272, the presence of Met in the peptide distributed the ion intensity in several adducts, impeding a quantitative estimation of its S-nitrosylation. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of Cys374 strikingly increased upon TCR engagement, reaching levels comparable to those observed upon Cys-NO treatment (Fig 7D). Similarly, S-nitrosylation on Cys374 increased in primary human T lymphoblasts stimulated with CD3 Ab, remaining below the S-nitrosylation levels observed in eNOS T cells (Fig 7D). Furthermore, biotin-switch analysis of CH7C17 and eNOS T cells expressing wild-type (WT)- or C374S-mCherry-β-actin and treated with Cys-NO or SEB-pulsed Raji APCs showed that S-nitrosylation of WT β-actin increased with respect to the C374S mutant (Fig 7E and 7F), indicating that, even if basal S-nitrosylation of other Cys could be observed, as a response to TCR engagement eNOS-derived NO mainly S-nitrosylated β-actin on Cys374.\n\nβ-actin S-nitrosylation on Cys374 impairs actin binding to profilin-1 (PFN1)\n\nMutation to Ser on the Cys374 of actin interferes with formation of PFN1-actin complexes in vitro [40]. Before studying whether S-nitrosylation on Cys374 also impaired the binding of β-actin to PFN1, we confirmed by coprecipitation experiments that PFN1 did not bind the C374S β-actin mutant in cells (Fig 8A). In contrast, PFN1 binding to wild-type mCherry-β-actin was detected in nonstimulated CH7C17 T cells and increased upon stimulation with SEB-pulsed Raji APCs (Fig 8A). An important feature of profilin is its capability to bind actin-associated and scaffolding proteins through their poly-L-Pro regions [41]. We took advantage of that to perform pull-down experiments with poly-L-Pro-coated sepharose beads, analyzing the interaction of PFN1 with β-actin in the presence or absence of Cys-NO (Fig 8B). Complexes between PFN1 and WT-mCherry-β-actin increased in T cells upon CD3 stimulation and diminished by Cys-NO treatment, which partially reproduced the defective interaction of C374S β-actin with PFN1 (Fig 8B). To corroborate that S-nitrosylation on Cys374 regulates the interaction of β-actin with PFN1, His-tagged recombinant WT mCherry-β-actin or its corresponding Cys-to-Ser mutants: 3C, on C257, 272, and 285; and 4C, on C257, 272, 285, and 374, whose sole difference was the mutation to Ser of Cys374 in 4C but not in 3C β-actin (S6A Fig), were in vitro translated and folded in the presence of the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT/TRiC (S6B–S6F Fig), in a similar way as described previously [42]. Translated actins were bound to agarose-Ni2+ beads, S-nitrosylated in vitro with Cys-NO, and allowed to bind PFN1 from CH7C17 T cell extracts by pull-down assays (Fig 8C). Whereas PFN1 barely associated with 4C β-actin, it bound considerably to WT- and 3C β-actin, decreasing significantly by pretreatment with Cys-NO (Fig 8C). Furthermore, stimulation via CD3 increased the formation of profilin-actin complexes in CH7C17 and G2A but not in eNOS T cells (Fig 8D), strongly suggesting that eNOS-mediated S-nitrosylation on Cys374 regulates the binding of β-actin to PFN1.\n\nβ-actin S-nitrosylation on Cys374 controls PKC-θ localization and activation at the IS by impairing actin binding to PFN1\n\nTo study whether S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374 regulated the localization and activation of PKC-θ by impairing actin binding to PFN1, CH7C17 T cells stably expressing comparable levels of WT-mCherry-β-actin or its corresponding Cys-to-Ser mutants 3C, 4C, and C374S (S7A Fig) were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. PKC-θ concentrated at the c-SMAC of WT- and 3C T cells and was similarly dispersed upon Cys-NO treatment (Fig 8E and 8F, S7B Fig). Interestingly, PKC-θ dispersed at the IS of cells expressing the mutant 4C or C374S, even in the absence of Cys-NO (Fig 8E and 8F, S7B Fig), as CD28 did on the IS of C374S mCherry-β-actin–expressing T cells (S8 Fig); furthermore, phosphorylation of PKC-θ increased in C374S T cells with respect to WT- and 3C T cells stimulated with SEB-pulsed Raji APCs (Fig 8G), indicating that the S-nitrosylation–defective C374S mutant mimics the actions exerted by the nitrosylating activity of eNOS-derived NO and Cys-NO on the localization and activation of PKC-θ.\n\nWe also studied the impact of S-nitrosylation on Cys374 on the organization of β-actin in the IS (Fig 9A–9D). WT-mCherry-β-actin localized at the front of motile T cells in F-actin–rich filopodia and microspikes and, after contact with antigen-pulsed APCs, those completely reorganized to form the d-SMAC as a lamellipodium-like structure packed with parallel distributed F-actin bundles (Fig 9A and S6 Movie). Remarkably, most of the radially-arranged WT-mCherry-β-actin–containing F-actin bundles in the d-SMAC were disorganized by the addition of 50 μM Cys-NO (Fig 9B and S7 Movie). Interestingly, whereas the mutant 3C organized in bundles of F-actin at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC, the C374S-mCherry-β-actin mutant did not (Fig 9C and 9D, S8 and S9 Movies). To explore whether β-actin S-nitrosylation on Cys374 may regulate the localization and activation of PKC-θ by reducing actin polymerization, fractionation of TX-100 extracts from WT- and C374S T cells stimulated with CD3 Ab and treated or not with Cys-NO was performed (Fig 9E). As a response to TCR engagement WT-mCherry-β-actin increased in the F-actin cell fraction, an effect prevented by treatment with Cys-NO (Fig 9E). Remarkably, recruitment of C374S-mCherry-β-actin to the F-actin fraction was impaired and remained almost unaltered after treatment with Cys-NO (Fig 9E). Moreover, WT-mCherry-β-actin incorporated into regularly spaced F-actin bundles at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC of cells activated on CD3 Ab-coated coverslips, and those were disorganized by treatment with Cys-NO, increasing lamellar and cytoplasmic actin—a pattern of actin also observed in cells overexpressing the C374S β-actin mutant (Fig 9F), suggesting that S-nitrosylation on Cys374 regulates PKC-θ at the IS through rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nTo corroborate that the reduced binding of PFN1 to β-actin S-nitrosylated on Cys374 is important for the actin rearrangement associated with the localization of PKC-θ at the IS, we generated CH7C17 T cells stably expressing mCherry-tagged constructs of the previously characterized C374A- and C374D-β-actin mutants [43] (S9A Fig). Similar to C374S, C374D β-actin neither organized in F-actin bundles nor bound to PFN1 (Fig 10A and 10B and S9B Fig). In contrast, C374A organized in F-actin and bound to PFN1 in a manner similar to WT β-actin (Fig 10A and 10B and S9B Fig). Interestingly, PKC-θ concentrated at the IS of C374A T cells and was barely disturbed by Cys-NO, whereas it was evenly dispersed in C374D T cells (Fig 10B and 10C), supporting the hypothesis that the binding of PFN1 to β-actin is important for the localization of PKC-θ at the IS. To further validate this, parental CH7C17 T cells were transfected with control EGFP, EGFP-PFN1 WT, or the actin binding-defective PFN1 mutant H119E [44]. Overexpression of H119E increased the recruitment and area of PKC-θ at the IS, disturbing its coalescence to the c-SMAC, whereas WT PFN1 but not H119E counteracted the actions exerted by Cys-NO on the recruitment and localization of PKC-θ (Fig 10D–10G).\n\nCollectively, these results strongly suggested that in antigen-specific T cell–APC conjugates eNOS-derived NO S-nitrosylates β-actin on Cys374, a posttranslational modification that, by altering the formation of profilin-actin complexes, controls TCR-triggered actin polymerization and retrograde flow at the IS, regulating from the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nActin depolymerizing and stabilizing agents and the functional interference of the actin nucleator complex Arp2/3 disturb the architecture of the IS [13,24,25]; nevertheless, the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood, and the participation of additional factors has been proposed [26]. In this work we show that one of these factors is NO. Previous evidence indicates that NO rearranges the actin cytoskeleton in T lymphocytes and disturbs the organization of CD3 at the c-SMAC [8,45]. We have investigated herein the mechanisms underlying the impact of NO on the organization of the IS, focusing on PKC-θ as a c-SMAC hallmark whose activation depends on its proximity to the p-SMAC [17].\n\nOur results show that, upon TCR triggering, eNOS translocates with the Golgi to the IS, interacting with F-actin and reducing actin polymerization. Although this interaction may be indirect, our findings are in agreement with previous studies in endothelial cells, which showed that eNOS interacts with cortical F-actin at the plasma membrane and with G-actin on the Golgi complex, activating the enzyme to produce NO [46]. Besides the regulation of the production of NO by β-actin, a complementary process has also been demonstrated through studies carried out in leukocytes, in which exposure to NO led to the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton [45,47]. Our findings are thus consistent with the association of eNOS with F-actin early during the burst of actin polymerization induced by TCR triggering and thereafter with the depolymerization of β-actin close to the IS by local production of eNOS-derived NO.\n\nExperimental models of T cell activation on surfaces coated with CD3 Ab have helped to establish that the lamellipodium plays a critical role in the organization and activation of signaling microclusters in the IS [35,48]. The lamellipodium shares structural and functional analogies with the d-SMAC, both showing similar patterns of F-actin organization and displaying extensive actin-based retrograde flow [12,49,50]. High-resolution 4D imaging studies of conjugates between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and target cells have recently confirmed and extended this issue by showing that polymerization and retrograde flow of actin increased in the periphery of the IS whereas it decreased in its central area [51]. Accordingly, our data show that eNOS partially colocalizes with F-actin at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC, reducing actin polymerization and retrograde flow. Through this, eNOS-derived NO can facilitate sustained signaling by reducing from the d-SMAC the inward transit of signaling molecules associated with actin, as indicated by our TIRFM experiments in which transfection of eNOS, but not its G2A-defective mutant, retained PKC-θ out of the c-SMAC. However, besides the lateral movement of signaling microclusters, Golgi and centrosome translocation to and vesicle fusion at the IS (regulated by early actin depletion and the formation of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor [SNARE] complexes, respectively) are also important suppliers of signaling molecules to the c-SMAC [51,52]. In this regard, our complementary loss-of-function studies provide compelling evidence that eNOS favors early actin depletion and accumulation of PKC-θ at the IS; whether this may result through the regulation of vesicular traffic from the Golgi apparatus will need further research.\n\nAlthough CD28 is not essential for the recruitment of PKC-θ to the IS, the coalescence of PKC-θ to the c-SMAC is promoted by CD28—requiring its cytoplamic tail and binding to CD80 on the APC [17,53]—and the association of PKC-θ with the actin cytoskeleton via filamin A, a process positively regulated by PKC-θ sumoylation, and by the actin-uncapping protein Rltpr, whose L432P mutant disturbs the localization of PKC-θ but not CD28 in the IS [21,54]; accordingly, we provide evidence that upon TCR engagement, eNOS fosters the recruitment of a fraction of PKC-θ to the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, eNOS similarly controls the coalescence of PKC-θ and CD28 to the IS, suggesting that an Rltpr-independent mechanism may be involved. It is feasible thus that, as part of this mechanism, eNOS-derived NO interfered with the linking of the CD28–filamin A–PKC-θ complex to actin and its flow towards the c-SMAC such as it has been recently described for the desumoylation of PKC-θ, which impairs the coalescence of both PKC-θ and CD28 [21]. Whether the sumoylation of PKC-θ would be also involved in the actin-mediated mechanism by which NO regulates the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS remains a standing question.\n\nOur data also show that eNOS-synthesized NO controls the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC through a cGMP-independent mechanism that involves S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374. Because of the accessibility of Cys374 in the flexible C-terminal region of β-actin, its sulfhydryl group is highly reactive [55]. Specific labelling of Cys374 with the fluorescent probe TMR-5-maleimide renders actin non-polymerizable [56]. Further, S-glutathionylation on Cys374 by NADPH oxidase–generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) disturbs actin polymerization in the lamellipodium of neutrophils, and either Cys374 mutation to Ser or S-nitrosylation impairs the formation of microfilaments in vitro [40,57,58]. Although structural constrains cannot be ruled out among the actions exerted by those modifications on actin polymerization and stability, prior studies have shown that mutation to Ser of Cys374 disturbs the binding of G-actin to profilin in vitro [40]. In cells, profilin–actin complexes prevent nucleation and spontaneous polymerization of actin at the pointed end of filaments, favoring their polymerization and treadmilling by providing monomeric actin to the barbed end of F-actin [59]. In this regard, our results show that profilin–actin complexes increased in T cells upon TCR triggering and that S-nitrosylation of β-actin on Cys374 disturbed its interaction with PFN1, suggesting a key role for this modification in the retrograde flow of actin that controls the localization and function of PKC-θ at the IS. We confirmed this possibility with the profilin-binding inactive mutant C374S, which hardly organized in F-actin bundles at the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC and activated but did not concentrate PKC-θ at the IS, whereas its corresponding PFN1-binding competent mutant C374A did, and was resistant to Cys-NO–induced PKC-θ dispersion.\n\nA role for PFN1 in lamellipodium formation has been previously reported to be dependent on both poly-L-Pro- and actin-binding [60]. We have shown here that the actin-binding defective PFN1 mutant H119E disturbed the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC and that WT PFN1 counteracted the dispersion of PKC-θ induced by Cys-NO. Our findings thus strongly suggested that, by organizing the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC, PFN1 regulated the localization of PKC-θ at the IS. Interestingly, a central role has been recently assigned to PFN1 as a master regulator of the major systems of actin polymerization in eukaryotic cells, favoring elongation of linear actin bundles by supplying profilin–actin complexes to both formins and Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) but inhibiting nucleation and Arp2/3-mediated branching of actin by competing with WASP for the binding to ATP-activated G-actin [61,62]. In this regard, formin-mediated nucleation of linear actin bundles in the d-SMAC has been proposed to be of importance for the formation of lamellar actin arcs and the movement of signaling microclusters towards the c-SMAC; furthermore, a subset of actin filaments specifically organized via WASP regulates TCR-triggered distal signaling, making evident the presence of highly specialized functional actin structures in the IS [63,64]. It is thus feasible that the defective binding between S-nitrosylated β-actin and PFN1 may regulate the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS by controlling the balance between actin structures resulting from the specific activities of formins and Arp2/3.\n\nA dual role for localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS in fostering effector T cell functions but disturbing the suppressor activities of regulatory T cells has been previously proposed [65]. Our loss-of-function studies and the actions exerted by the transnitrosylating agent Cys-NO on the localization and activation of PKC-θ at the IS of T cells are thus potentially relevant from a pathophysiological perspective. In this regard, recent interest has been given to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and differentiated lymphoid stromal cells (e.g., fibroblastic reticular cells and lymphoid endothelial cells) as sources of iNOS-derived NO that can control T cell activation and differentiation in mice [66]. Nevertheless, rather than producing iNOS-derived NO, human MSCs seem to exert T cell suppression through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and enzymatic depletion of tryptophan [67,68]. Although important differences between mice and humans should be taken into account before assigning cell sources and functions to NO in adaptive immune responses [69,70], previous studies have shown that NO from mouse lymphoid stromal cells disturbs the function of Th1 but not of Th2 cells [71]. Our study shows that eNOS-derived NO provides proactivation signals in human T cells, facilitating PKC-θ and NF-kB activation, a key signaling pathway for the differentiation and function of Th2 cells [16]. Whether exogenous NO from lymphoid stromal cells and endogenous NO from eNOS might coordinately regulate PKC-θ–dependent T cell fate decisions and functions at the IS warrants further investigation.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nAntibodies, cells, and reagents\n\nAntibodies were sourced as follows: CD3ε OKT3 and CD19 mAbs (BioLegend); eNOS, CD7 and PKC-θ mAb (BD Biosciences); eNOS pAb and β-actin mAbs (Sigma); PKC-θ, and Lamin B1 pAbs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Profilin-1 mAb (Synaptic System); phospho-PKC-θ (Thr 538),–CARMA1 (Ser652), -IKKα (Ser176) /β (Ser177) pAbs, and IKBα and phospho–IKBα (Ser32/36) mAbs (Cell Signaling Technology); CARMA1 pAb (Abcam); golgin-97 mAb (Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse (GAM) H&amp;L chain-specific IgG (Merck Millipore). mCherry pAb was generously provided by Dr. J. M. Requena (CBMSO, Madrid, Spain)\n\nThe Raji lymphoblastoid B cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco), supplemented with 8% FBS. CH7C17 Jurkat T cells transfected with a TCRvβ3 specific for a peptide from influenza hemagluttinin (HA) were grown in the presence of hygromycin (400 μg/ml) and puromycin (4 μg/ml) (Invivogen). Geneticin-418 (0.8 mg/ml, Invivogen) was also added for culturing CH7C17 T cells stably transfected with eNOS-, G2A-GFP, or mCherry-β-actin constructs. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats from healthy donors (provided by “Centro de Transfusiones de la Comunidad de Madrid”) by separation on a biocoll gradient (Biochrom). After a 30-min plating step at 37°C, nonadherent cells were collected and cultured for 36 h in the presence of SEE (0.2 μg/ml) to induce lymphocyte proliferation. To obtain T lymphoblasts, IL-2 (50 U/ml) was added to the culture medium every 2 days. These cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and their phenotype was 98% CD3, 48% CD4, 46% CD8, 0.5% CD56, 0.2% CD19, 0.5% CD14, 85% CD45RO, and 19% CD45RA.

Davidson (University of Florida, Tallahassee, Florida). Mutants of mCherry-β-actin on Cys257, Cys272, Cys285, and Cys374 were generated with the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and verified by DNA sequencing. The mutagenic primers GAGCGGTTCCGCTCCCCTGAGGCACTC (C257S), GCATGGAGTCCTCTGGC ATCCACG (C272S), CCATCATGAAGTCTGACGTGGACATC (C285S), GTCCAC CGCAAATCCTTCTAGGCG (C374S), GTCCACCGCAAAGCCTTCTAGGGATCC (C374A), GTCCACCGCAAAGACTTCTAGGGATCC (C374D) and their complementary oligonucleotides were used to generate the mCherry-β-actin Cys-to-Ser mutants 3C, 4C, C374S, C374A, and C374D. pLifeAct-EGFP was provided by Dr. M.A. Alonso (CBMSO, Madrid, Spain), Speckle mCherry-β-actin was from Dr. M.

Bünemann (University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany).\n\nCell transfection and flow cytometry\n\nCH7C17 T cells (12 x 106) were transfected with 25 μg of expression plasmids encoding wild-type (WT) mCherry-β-actin or its corresponding Cys mutants, using the Gene Pulser II (BioRad) at 350 V and 1000 μF. CH7C17 T cells stably transfected with the indicated protein constructs were selected by cell sorting with a FACSCVantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and grown in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418.\n\nFor flow cytometry analysis of actin polymerization, eNOS and G2A cells were activated at 37°C on CD3 Ab-coated microwells (10 μg/ml) for the time indicated, detached gently with a pipette, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 15 min with 0.3% saponine in PBS, and F-actin was stained with phalloidin-Alexa647. Mean fluorescence intensity of F-actin staining was analyzed with a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo v7.6 software (TreeStar).\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing\n\nTo generate eNOS KO cell lines, CH7C17 T cells were transfected with eNOS CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmids encoding GFP, Cas9 nuclease, and eNOS single-guide RNAs for three 20 nt sequences, targeting exon 5 (TGGCTCAGGTGTTCGATGCC) and exon 6 (CTACGCGGGCTACCGGCAGC and AGCCCGCGTAGCGCACCAGC) (sc-400127, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and sorted by flow cytometry using as a marker the fluorescence of GFP. To obtain individual clones, single cells were expanded. By western blot with eNOS-specific mAb, we identified two eNOS KO clones (KO1 and KO2) and also a control clone that expressed eNOS similarly as parental CH7C17 T cells. For validation of those clones at DNA level, exons 5 and 6 were amplified by PCR on genomic DNA extracts, using the external primers GTACTGGATACCAAGTCAGCTTC and CAGCCGTGCTGAATGCAGAG, followed by a nested PCR with the primers GAGACACCTGGCCCAG and GTCTCCGTGACCACC. PCR products were sequenced and, in some cases, cloned into pGEM-T easy before sequencing.\n\nLentiviral shRNA interference\n\nViral particles containing eNOS-specific “MISSION shRNAs” (sheNOS1: TRCN0000045473 and sheNOS2: TRCN0000045477) in the lentiviral vector pLKO.1-Puro (Sigma) were produced at the CNIC Viral Vectors Unit. HEK293T cells were cotransfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) with control or eNOS shRNA pLKO.1-Puro, pCMV-dR8.91, and pVSV-G. Supernatants were collected after 48 h to 72 h and filtered (0.45 μm; Millipore). CH7C17 T cells were transduced with concentrated lentiviral vector stock at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 g for 90 min at 32°C and incubated at 37°C for 72 h.\n\nImmunofluorescence and confocal fluorescence microscopy\n\nFor the study of superantigen-specific T cell–APC conjugates, Raji APC (3 x 105) were incubated for 20 min with 0.5 μg/ml SEB or SEE and then mixed with CH7C17 (4 x 105) or human T lymphoblast (5 x 105), respectively. Cells were then plated on poly-L-Lys–coated coverslips and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in humidified chambers. For studies of stimulation on activation surfaces, CH7C17 T cells (3 x 105) were plated for 15 min onto coverslips treated with CD3 Abs. Cells were then fixed for 8 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, rinsed with TBS pH 8.4, and then permeabilized for 30 s in 0.1% Triton-X100 before incubation with the corresponding Abs. eNOS was visualized by staining with a pAb, followed by anti-rabbit IgG Alexa647. The Golgi was stained with Golgin-97 mAb, followed by anti-mouse IgG Alexa488 (Life Technologies). PKC-θ was visualized by staining with a pAb, followed by anti-goat IgG Alexa488, Alexa555, or Alexa647 (Life Technologies). F-actin was stained with Phalloidin-Alexa488, -Alexa568, or -TRITC. Double immunofluorescence was performed using eNOS rabbit pAb and phalloidin-TRITC or PKC-θ goat pAb. Mounted coverslips were observed under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning unit attached to a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 microscope equipped with a PL APO 63X/1.4 oil objective. Images stacks of 0.25, 0.34, or 0.40 μm were acquired with settings that in each case allowed the maximum signal detection below the saturation limits of the detectors. To assess the spatial distribution of PKC-θ in cells, the staining of PKC-θ accumulated as a major dot at the contact area of T cells with APCs was scrutinized through 15–18 confocal image sections and scored to obtain percentages of cells with PKC-θ at the c-SMAC, similarly as described previously [10]. The area and fluorescence of PKC-θ at the T-cell–APC contact site and the distance from eNOS were obtained with Leica image analysis software (Leica Microsystems) to process the image stacks acquired in the region of interest. For the study of the contact area between T and B cells, eNOS, G2A, or parental CH7C17 cells were allowed to conjugate with SEB-pulsed Raji B cells for 20 min. Cells were then fixed and labeled with anti-CD7 (Becton Dickinson) and Biotin anti-CD19 (Biolegend), subsequently stained with appropriate secondary anti-mouse (F(ab’)2) Alexa568 and Streptavidin Alexa 647, and mounted onto Prolong Gold-DAPI. Cells were studied by fluorescence confocal imaging. To analyze the distribution of CD7 and CD19 at the IS, three-dimensional reconstructions of the area were generated with the Leica software. The T cell–B cell contact surface was defined as the common area for CD7 and CD19. Area values were measured with a Matlab routine for analysis of SMACs regions from three independent experiments. Mean values from area were calculated. To analyze F-actin in phalloidin-TRITC–labeled T cell–APC conjugates, the mean fluorescence (AU) of cross-sections was drawn through a field, including the IS. To analyze F-actin and mCherry-β-actin levels in WT- and C374S-mCherry-β-actin T cells plated onto CD3 Ab-coated coverslips, we identify the region occupied by F-actin at representative lamellipodium-like d-SMACs of WT-mCherry-β-actin T cells using a median filter (with a kernel size of 20) and consecutively a thresholding on the resulting image. We identified in this way an internal and external area and calculated the average difference of the external minus internal radius. Then, in the three lower z-stack images, we identified just the external border and we shrank it in a way that the average difference of the radius was the mean value from WT-mCherry-β-actin T cells. We calculated F-actin and mCherry mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) per area inside and outside the region corresponding to the lamellipodium-like d-SMAC. This analysis was performed using a user-customized routine, written in Python, that uses image analysis and numerical calculus packages plus the packages for the graphical user interface.\n\nFor colocalization analysis of F-actin and eNOS, the nuclear region was excluded and a median filter applied to the raw images. To obtain the Manders colocalization coefficient, the JACoP plugin from ImageJ (NIH, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) was applied to filtered images.\n\nIn some cases, brightness and contrast adjustments with Photoshop (Adobe) were applied to images.\n\nTime-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy\n\nFor time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy studies, T cells in phenol red-free RPMI-1640 medium containing 20 mM HEPES and 2% FBS or in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with 25 mM HEPES and 2% FBS were allowed to interact with SEB-pulsed Raji APC (1:1 cell ratio) on LabTec II chambers (Nalge Nunc International) or slides coated with FN (50 μg/ml) in Attofluor chambers (Invitrogen), maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and observed under a confocal laser–scanning unit (TCS SP5; Leica) attached to an inverted epifluorescence microscope (DMI6000; Leica) fitted with an HCX PL APO 63X/1.40–0.6 oil objective. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) frames were obtained simultaneously at 15 s, 30 s, or 45 s intervals. At least six confocal sections were necessary to capture the entire fluorescent signal. For F-actin and NO detection at the IS, CRISPR/Cas9 cells were transfected with LifeAct-EGFP and 24 h posttransfection were preloaded with the DAR-4M-AM probe (30 min, 37°C, 0.5 μM), extensively washed with complete medium, and resuspended in imaging medium. Stacks of 27–29 sections for fluorescence and bright field images were acquired at intervals of 17.54 s to 25 s. 3D analysis and maximal projections of the T cell–APC conjugates were generated to obtain a Z stack projection and the corresponding movies. Images were processed with accompanying confocal software (LCS; Leica), IMARIS, or WCIF ImageJ. Analysis of LifeAct-EGFP and NO densities of fluorescence at the IS was performed with the user-customized routine described above.\n\nTIRFM and image analysis\n\nCH7C17, eNOS, and G2A T cells transfected with speckle mCherry-β-actin or pMSCV-PKC-θ-TagRFP-T were allowed to settle onto CD3 Ab-coated glass-bottomed microwell dishes (No 1.5, Mattek). Recording was initiated immediately after cell addition, and visualization was performed with an Andor-DU8285 VP-4094 camera coupled to a Leica AM TIRF MC M, mounted on a Leica DMI 6000B microscope. Images were acquired with a HCX PL APO 100.0x1.46 OIL objective and processed with the confocal software LCS (Leica). For β-actin speckle tracking and flow calculation and for PKCθ-mRFP recording, penetrance was 90 nm for 561 nm laser channel with the same objective angle (25 ms time exposure), and frames were taken every 260–500 ms. Synchronization was performed through the Leica software. Speed measures were obtained through the calculation of slopes from position versus time displacements, using a customized routine from Matlab software. To estimate the velocity of the speckles diffusing toward the center of the cell, we visualized the sum of the intensity time series. On these images the tracks of the diffusing speckles are emphasized, favoring the selection of a segment to identify the pixels explored by the speckle during its diffusion. A section of the whole stack is used to define a region of interest (ROI) around the wake of the speckle. We threshold this ROI and perform a linear fitting of the points. The velocity of the speckle is calculated from the slope given by the linear fit. The final slope represented for each cell corresponds to the mean from 16 different measurements out of the analysis of four sections depicted on the projections of the movie frames from the cells studied. ImageJ software (NIH) was used to analyze the corresponding movies.\n\nCell fractionation in Triton X-100, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting\n\nT Cells were lysed in buffer CSK (50 mM PIPES pH6.9, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.2% Triton-X100, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell extracts were incubated at 4°C for 20 min and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected as Triton X-100–soluble fractions. Proteins from Triton X-100–insoluble pellets were extracted in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated for 15 min at 4°C, and centrifuged as before. For immunoprecipitation, protein extracts from parental and mCherry-transfected CH7C17 T cells (6 x 106) were incubated overnight at 4°C with 3 μl anti-mCherry pAb and protein A-Sepharose beads. After three washes in lysis buffer, immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation. Supernatants from either soluble or insoluble cell fractions, and immunocomplexes were resuspended in reducing Laemmli loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted with specific Abs and imaged on a fluorescence scanner (Odyssey, LI-COR Biosciences) or chemiluminescence detection system (LAS-4000, GE Healthcare Life Science).\n\nDetection of NO production\n\nCells were stimulated at 37°C under continuous rotation with CD3 Ab or Raji B cells (cell ratio = 4:1) pulsed with SEB or SEE (1 μg/ml) in 1 ml HBSS. NO production was monitored for 30 min with an ISO-NOP NO electrode (World Precision Instruments), which was calibrated against known concentrations of NaNO2 under reducing conditions (KI/H2SO4) at 37°C.\n\nConstruction, expression, and purification of His-tagged mCherry-β-actin and in vitro binding assay\n\n6xHis-tagged WT, 3C, and 4C mCherry-β-actin were generated by subcloning WT-, 3C-, and 4C-mCherry-β-actin in the pET-His6TEV-LIC vector using the Ligase Independent Cloning (LIC) method. WT-, 3C-, and 4C-mCherry-β-actin were expressed in vitro in Escherichia coli translation lysates (New England Biolabs) supplemented with the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT/TRiC, following the protocol by Stemp et al. [42]. Briefly, CCT was purified from bovine testis similarly as described [73], and added to E. coli translation lysates (3 μM), to proceed with the in vitro transcription–translation reaction following the manufacturer’s protocol. To characterize the binding of soluble translated β-actins to DNase I, 0.2 μg of each one was diluted in 0.8 ml G-buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM CaCl2) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with DNase I covalently-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads. After incubation, collected beads were washed three times in G-buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. DNase I-bound recombinant β-actins were eluted with reducing Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblot.\n\nTranslated actins were assayed for binding activity to profilin-1 as follows: recombinant mCherry-β-actin–coated agarose Ni2+ beads of 0.5 μg each were preincubated at room temperature in 150 μL G-buffer, containing or not containing 100 μM Cys-NO. After washing, 0.8 ml extracts from 6 x 105 CH7C17 T cells in G-buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA were added and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Proteins bound to recombinant mCherry-β-actin–coated agarose Ni2+ beads were washed twice with G-buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, with the same buffer plus 5 mM imidazole, and proteins associated with recombinant β-actin eluted in Laemmli loading buffer. β-actin–bound profilin-1 was determinated by SDS-PAGE and immunobloting with a profilin-1–specific mAb.\n\nBiotin switch\n\nCells were treated with Cys-NO, stimulated with SEB-pulsed Raji cells or with CD3 Ab in the dark, and then lysed in buffer TENT (50 mM Tris pH 6.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM neocuproine, 1% Triton-X100, 70 mM N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM), 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation of cell extracts, a blocking step was carried out in 2% SDS at 40°C for 30 min with agitation in the dark. Proteins were precipitated with acetone and resuspended in buffer HENS (100 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM neocuproine, and 2% SDS) containing 80 mM ascorbate and 0.4 mM biotin-HPDP; the samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with agitation. Proteins were reprecipitated with acetone and resuspended in 0.2 volume of HENS buffer and 0.8 volume of neutralization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). For precipitation of biotinylated proteins, samples were incubated with Streptavidin-Sepharose beads for 60 min at room temperature with agitation. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, 600 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and once with elution buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (20 mM HEPES pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA). Proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 200 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 37°C with agitation. Supernatants were collected and proteins analyzed by immunoblot.\n\nProteomic analysis\n\nProteomic analyses were performed similarly as previously reported [74]. Peptide mixtures were subjected to nano-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for protein identification. Peptides were injected onto a C-18 reversed phase nano-column (75 μm I.D. and 50 cm, Acclaim-PepMap, Thermo) and analyzed in a continuous acetonitrile gradient, consisting of 0%–31% B in 130 min, 50%–90% B in 1 min (B = 98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A flow rate of 200 nL/min was used to elute peptides from the RP nano-column to an emitter nanospray needle for real-time ionization and peptide fragmentation on an Orbitrap-ELITE mass spectrometer (Thermo). An enhanced FT-resolution spectrum (resolution = 120,000) followed by the CID-MS/MS spectra from the most intense fifteen parent ions were analyzed along the chromatographic run. Dynamic exclusion was set at 25 s.\n\nFor protein identification and characterization of IAM- and NEM-labeled peptides, fragmentation spectra were searched against MSDB database using the SEQUEST program. Two miscleavages were allowed, and an error of 15 ppm or 10 ppm was set for full MS or MS/MS spectra searches, respectively. All identifications were performed by Proteome Discoverer 1.0 software (Thermo). Decoy database search for FDR analysis was set at 0.05 by applying corresponding filters.\n\nPull-down experiments with sepharose-coupled poly-L-Pro\n\nCells were centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors) at 4°C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated (90 min, 4°C) with poly-L-Pro covalently linked to CNBr-Sepharose beads. After incubation, collected beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. PFN1 and β-actin were eluted with reducing Laemmli buffer and samples separated by 15% SDS-PAGE in parallel with corresponding whole cell lysates to detect PFN1 and β-actin inputs.\n\nDensitometry and statistical analyses\n\nQuantitative estimation of proteins in immunoblots was performed by densitometric analysis of bands with ImageJ (NIH). Densitometric results were normalized to protein inputs and values processed with spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel 2007) and represented as fold induction ratios (mean ± SEM). Data within groups were compared using analysis of variance (1-way ANOVA) with Newman-Keul’s posthoc correction for multiple comparisons or Student’s t-test to compare two sets of data (GraphPad, Prism 5). Statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05 or lower.\n\nSupporting information"
