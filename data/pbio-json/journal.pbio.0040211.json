  "fullText": "In most cases, a fertilized egg with two X chromosomes will become a girl and an XY egg will become a boy. Molecular analysis of the genomes of sex-reversed individuals identified the sex-determining region Y gene \n\t\t\t\t(Sry), the primary sex-determining gene in mammals. The presence of an \n\t\t\t\tSry gene normally drives male development. But when downstream elements of the sex-determining pathway are disrupted, chromosomal sex and sexual phenotype can be discordant. This phenomenon revealed a fatal flaw in a now-defunct Olympics rule requiring female athletes to submit to “gender verification” procedures that labeled XY females “imposters.”\n\nEvery embryonic gonad—at this point, neither ovary nor testis—harbors cells with the potential to choose either fate (male or female). Reflecting this noncommittal approach, both XX and XY gonads initially display similar expression patterns for the sex-determining genes \n\t\t\t\tSox9, \n\t\t\t\tFgf9, and \n\t\t\t\tWnt4. If \n\t\t\t\tSry does not intervene during a critical window in development, the cells will default to the ovarian pathway. Once \n\t\t\t\tSry expression begins, other genes start to choose sides: \n\t\t\t\tSox9 and \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 become active only in male gonads, while \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 becomes active only in female gonads. Loss of \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 in XY mice leads to sex reversal; in XX mice, loss of \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 leads to partial testis development. Only when the protein products of \n\t\t\t\tSry, \n\t\t\t\tSox9, and \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 are all expressed together do male-specific Sertoli cells develop—and prod the developing gonad toward full male differentiation.\n\nClearly, \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 and \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 must somehow influence sex determination—but how? In a new study, Yuna Kim, Blanche Capel, and colleagues explored how \n\t\t\t\tSry, \n\t\t\t\tSox9, \n\t\t\t\tFgf9, and \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 contribute to the initial events of sex determination in mice. By manipulating the activity of these signals, they show that \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 and \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 play a sexual tug of war. If \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 wins, the gonad differentiates into an ovary. If \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 wins, it turns into a testis. Living up to its name, \n\t\t\t\tSry tips the balance in favor of \n\t\t\t\tFgf9, by triggering expression of \n\t\t\t\tSox9, and a male fate.\n\nThe researchers started by examining \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 expression during normal gonad development in the mouse. 11.5 days after conception, \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 was evenly distributed in the gonads of both sexes. By day 12, it was found only in XY gonads, and only in Sertoli cells within testis cords and cells near the surface of the gonad.\n\nSeeing \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 expressed so early in testis differentiation suggested it might trigger \n\t\t\t\tSry activity or expression, but the researchers found that this wasn't the case. If \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 doesn't regulate \n\t\t\t\tSry, they reasoned, maybe it affects the male-specific up-regulation of \n\t\t\t\tSox9, which is absent in XY mice lacking \n\t\t\t\tFgf9. Adding \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 to XX cells isolated from 11.5-day-old gonads triggered increased \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression. These findings showed that artificial expression of \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 can induce \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression in single XX cells, but what about in the intact gonad?\n\nIn normal and mutant \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 XY mice, \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression followed similar patterns for the first 24 hours after \n\t\t\t\tSry was expressed. By 12.5 days, SOX9 proteins were no longer expressed in the mutant mice, and the cells that would normally have developed into Sertoli cells failed to organize into normal testis cords. These results, the researchers conclude, indicate that \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 isn't necessary to trigger \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression, but instead is required to maintain \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression in Sertoli precursor cells.\n\n\t\t\t\tFgf9 expression depends on \n\t\t\t\tSox9, and \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 returns the favor by maintaining \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression in a positive feed-forward loop. The feed-forward loop between these genes allows the proliferation and expansion of Sertoli and other somatic cells in XY gonads. Without \n\t\t\t\tFgf9, XY gonads showed a rapid drop in SOX9 protein levels and expressed few or no Sertoli cell markers. \n\t\t\t\tWnt4, on the other hand, increased, suggesting it was repressed by \n\t\t\t\tFgf9. Without the antagonistic effects of \n\t\t\t\tFgf9, \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 predominates, disrupting the \n\t\t\t\tFgf9–Sox9 pathway and establishing the infrastructure necessary to become female. And the reverse holds true: reducing \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 levels in XX gonads allows FGF9 and SOX9 levels to increase—even in the absence of \n\t\t\t\tSry—though other male factors appear to be required to establish testis development.\n\nAltogether, these results suggest that sex is not determined by the flip of a genetic switch but by a dose-dependent interplay between opposing signals. The researchers propose that \n\t\t\t\tSry initiates the male fate by triggering \n\t\t\t\tSox9 expression, which activates \n\t\t\t\tFgf9, and sets off a feed-forward loop that produces a male, barring the interference of antagonistic signals. Whether these signals work within or between cells is not clear. It may be, for example, that \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 recruits other cells to the Sertoli pathway by triggering increased \n\t\t\t\tFgf9–Sox9 expression, or that \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 causes Sertoli cells to proliferate until they reach the critical mass needed to fend off \n\t\t\t\tWnt4 and secure the male pathway. Future studies can investigate the molecular mechanisms of \n\t\t\t\tFgf9 and \n\t\t\t\tWnt4—and whether these competing pathways regulate the battle of the sexes in a wide range of vertebrates.",
