  "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated.

The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients, the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly correlated with patient’s survival.

  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nBreast cancer is prone to relapse and metastasize to other organs, such as lung, brain, liver, and bone marrow, which results in worse outcomes in breast cancer patients [1–3]. Therefore, discovering the mechanism of metastasis of breast cancer is especially important for anti–breast cancer treatments. The ability to reprogram metabolism to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years [4–7]. Numerous studies have demonstrated metabolic alteration of protein synthesis, glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and nucleotide synthesis in different types of cancer [8–12]. Thus, the investigation of the metabolic alternation in breast cancer progression, especially in metastasis, is very promising for the discovery of new drug target. Recently, many studies in cancer metabolism have focused on the metabolic regulation and crosstalk between signaling pathways and metabolic networks [13]. For example, pathways downstream of oncogenes have been shown to regulate cancer cell metabolism. It has been reported that oncogene c-Myc orchestrates nucleotide biosynthesis by up-regulating the expression of nucleotide synthesis enzyme phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) [8]. In cancer cells, nucleotide production greatly increases because of the demand of ribosomal RNA, which synthesizes DNA and maintains the transcriptome during the rapid cell proliferation. It also functions as an important downstream of major nutrient pathways [14] and chemotherapeutic target of almost all types of cancer. Thus, nucleotide synthesis is of importance in the cancer cell metabolic network. However, the crosstalk of nucleotide synthesis and signaling pathways that regulate cellular programs is still less clear.\n\nIn this work, we isolated a highly metastatic cell population from parent breast cancer cells via an in vivo mouse model and analyzed the whole metabolome, isotope tracing of 13C, and transcriptome. We successfully identified highly activated nucleotide de novo synthesis to be a new metabolic hallmark of the lung metastatic breast cancer cells and investigated the underlying molecular metabolism. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that by analyzing the clinical information, we found a high level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine metabolism, correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients, suggesting a new prognostic marker for breast cancer.\n\nResults\n\nMetastatic breast cancer cells in lung display increased nucleotide de novo synthesis\n\nTo assess metabolic alterations during the metastasis of breast cancer cells, we isolated a subpopulation of murine breast cancer cells 4TO7 with enhanced lung metastatic behavior (denoted 4TO7Lung) from parental 4TO7 cells (denoted 4TO7Ori), which have much less metastatic capacity [15, 16] via 3-round selection in an in vivo experimental metastasis model in mice (Fig 1A and 1B). We conducted a metabolomics profiling of these cells followed by an isotope tracing of 13C after feeding the cells with 13C-labeled glucose. The results from metabolomics profiling showed that compared with 4TO7Ori, 4TO7Lung cells displayed increased metabolites enriched in nucleotide metabolism, including all 5 nucleotides and the intermediate metabolites in their de novo synthesis pathways, such as N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate (Fig 1C and 1D). Moreover, isotope tracing of 13C confirmed that metastatic 4TO7Lung cells increased the uptake of glucose, which was mainly utilized to synthesize nucleotides via the de novo pathway because enhanced glucose uptake went mainly to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for synthesizing ribose-5-phosphate and subsequent 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) for the de novo synthesis of nucleotides, while the glycolysis was not enhanced (Fig 1E and 1F). The purinosome is a multienzyme complex that is formed during the de novo purine synthesis [17, 18], which can be visualized by immunofluorescent staining of its core components (Fig 1G). Compared with 4TO7Ori cells, 4TO7Lung cells showed more purinosomes (Fig 1H and 1I), further confirming the enhanced purine de novo synthesis in high metastatic breast cancer cells.\n\nNucleotide de novo synthesis genes are up-regulated in metastatic breast cancer cells and reversely correlate with patient’s survival\n\nTo gain insights into the metastasis-related metabolic reprogramming from gene transcriptional level, we analyzed the transcriptome of 4TO7Lung cells. Gene set enrichment assay (GSEA) revealed that genes encoding key enzymes in nucleotide de novo synthesis such as Prps2, Ppat, Pfas Gmps, Gart, etc were significantly up-regulated, whereas genes involved in catalyzing nucleotide salvage synthesis pathway were down-regulated (Fig 2A and 2B; S1A and S1B Fig). These results were further verified by western bolt and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Fig 2C and 2D). Consistently, this gene expression signature was also observed in another highly metastatic, 4TO7-originated murine breast cancer cell line 4T1 (Fig 2C and 2D) [16]. Moreover, the expression level of the rate-limiting enzyme PRPS2, which catalyze the PRPP formation, positively correlated with the malignancy of murine and human breast cancer cell lines (Fig 2E–2H).\n\nNext, we performed immunohistochemistry analyses of key enzymes in nucleotide de novo synthesis reactions, i.e., carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 (CAD), phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2), guanine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), and adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS), in primary and metastatic tumor foci spontaneously formed in mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen (MMTV-PyMT) mice or formed in 4T1-inoculated syngeneic mouse model, confirming that these enzymes were up-regulated in metastatic cancer cells (Fig 2I, S1C Fig).\n\nAdditionally, we analyzed a cohort containing 542 breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found the expression levels of major genes in purine de novo synthesis pathways, when considered together, reversely correlates with the survival of patients (Fig 2J), as did the pyrimidine synthesis genes (Fig 2K). Analyses of breast cancer patients from Kaplan-Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&amp;cancer=breast) also suggested that high expression of individual key enzymes, such as PRPS2, CAD, GMPS, and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase and phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthase (PAICS), correlated with poor patients’ survival (S1D–S1G Fig).\n\nBlocking nucleotide de novo synthesis by silencing PRPS2 inhibits lung metastasis of breast cancer cells\n\nTo further assess the significance of nucleotide de novo synthesis for breast cancer metastasis, we specifically silenced Prps2, a key enzyme catalyzing the first reaction in nucleotide synthesis, which was highly up-regulated in metastatic cells [19] (Fig 3A and 3B). Knocking down Prps2 caused dramatically decreased expression of other key enzymes in de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways (Fig 3C; S2A and S2B Fig), suggesting that Prps2 might cooperate with these enzymes to regulate the whole de novo synthesis process. In Prps2-silenced 4TO7Lung cells, we observed less formation of purinosomes (Fig 3D and 3E). Isotope tracing of 13C further confirmed that silencing Prps2 successfully decreased the de novo synthesis of nucleotides in 4TO7Lung cells (Fig 3F and 3G).\n\nNext, we assessed the impact of reduced de novo synthesis on breast cancer metastasis in vivo by injecting Prps2-silenced 4TO7Lung cells or 4T1 cells into the tail vein. We observed that reduction of de novo nucleotide synthesis in these highly metastatic cells dramatically reduced their lung metastasis behavior, resulting in much better survival of cancer-bearing mice (Fig 3H–3J, S2C Fig). Furthermore, in a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model using subcutaneously inoculated 4T1 cells, silencing Prps2 dramatically reduced lung metastasis (S2D and S2E Fig), whereas the growth of the primary tumor was not significantly affected (S2F Fig). These results suggested that Prps2-mediated de novo nucleotide synthesis was essential for the lung metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells.\n\nDe novo nucleotide synthesis enhances the stemness of breast cancer cells\n\nTo further study the cellular mechanism underlying de novo nucleotide synthesis-enhanced metastatic capacity of breast cancer, we firstly investigated the apoptosis resistance, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, and proliferation of 4TO7Ori and 4TO7Lung cells. We found no significant differences of those capacity except cell motility (S3A–S3F Fig). Interestingly, the motility of 4TO7Lung cells was even attenuated, shown by the transwell migration assay, indicating enhanced metastasis of 4TO7Lung cells was not due to the change of motility. We next tested the stemness of 4TO7Ori and 4TO7Lung cells by sphere formation assay. The 4TO7Lung cells showed higher sphere formation efficiency than 4TO7Ori cells (Fig 4A and 4B), suggesting 4TO7Lung cells gained more stem-cell-like properties. To further confirm, we performed a limited dilution allograft assay by injecting 4TO7Lung or 4TO7Ori cells into mice through tail vein. The 4TO7Lung cells showed a much stronger tumor formation capacity in the lung even when the cell number was as low as 103 cells/injection (Fig 4C and 4D). Furthermore, 4TO7Lung cells showed higher expression of the signature genes of cancer stem cells (CSCs), suggesting the enhanced stemness of 4TO7Lung cells (Fig 4E and 4F). The flow cytometry assay also revealed higher percentage of side population cells in 4TO7Lung cells in comparison with 4TO7Ori cells (Fig 4G and 4H). By using another well-established breast CSC signature, i.e., CD44 and CD24, we found that 4TO7Lung cells had significantly increased percentage of CSC-like CD44high/CD24low populations in comparison with 4TO7Ori (Fig 4I and 4J). All this evidence suggested the enhanced stemness of 4TO7Lung cells contributed to the high lung metastasis behavior.\n\nTo confirm the enhanced stemness of 4TO7Lung cells was due to Prps2-mediated de novo nucleotide synthesis, we silenced Prps2 in 4TO7Lung or 4T1 cells. We found the sphere formation capacities of Prps2-silenced 4TO7Lung or 4T1 cells were greatly attenuated (Fig 4K and 4L; S4A-S4D Fig). Moreover, a limited dilution allograft assay using different dosages of 4TO7Lung cells showed that the tumor initiation capacities in the lung was significantly reduced once Prps2 was knocked down (Fig 4M and 4N). In addition, silencing Prps2 dramatically reduced the expression of stemness signature genes in 4TO7Lung cells (Fig 4O and 4P, S4E and S4F Fig), further confirming the pivotal role of Prps2-mediated de novo nucleotide synthesis in the enhancement of CSC-like properties in breast cancer cells.\n\nDe novo nucleotide synthesis promotes breast cancer cell stemness via cyclic guanosine monophosphate/PKG pathway\n\nTo gain insights into the molecular mechanism by which de novo nucleotide synthesis enhanced the stemness of breast cancer cells, we were focusing on 2 nucleotide-related signaling metabolites, i.e., cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which are able to activate downstream signaling pathway to regulate cell growth and renewal (Fig 5A) [20]. Thus, we compared the cGMP and cAMP levels and found that high metastatic 4TO7Lung cells showed little change on cAMP level, while significantly increasing on cGMP level, which could be decreased by silencing Prps2 (Fig 5B). Silencing Prps2 attenuated stemness of 4TO7Lung cells could be rescued by adding cGMP analog in the medium, strongly suggesting that cGMP was a key downstream factor mediating Prps2-boosted stemness (Fig 5C). cGMP could also increase the CSC-like properties of low metastatic 4TO7Ori cells, further demonstrating a key role of cGMP-dependent pathway in supporting CSC-like properties (Fig 5D). Next, we examined the activation of cGMP-dependent kinase PKG and downstream pathways. We observed highly activated PKG in 4TO7Lung cells shown by the phosphorylation of its downstream factors extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) (Fig 5E), which could be inactivated by knocking down Prps2 (Fig 5F), suggesting Prps2-enhanced nucleotide synthesis was able to activate cGMP/PKG pathway. We also found that silencing both Prkg1 and Prkg2, 2 members of PKG, dramatically reduced the CSC-like properties of 4TO7Lung cells, shown by reduced expression of stemness signature genes (Fig 5G–5I) and the side populations in 4TO7Lung cells (Fig 5J and 5K), confirming the importance of cGMP/PKG pathway in regulating the stemness of breast cancer cells.\n\ncGMP/PKG-MEK-ERK signaling pathway enhances breast cancer cell stemness\n\nWe next study the cGMP/PKG downstream pathway regulating the stemness of breast cancer cells. We were focusing on the downstream MEK-ERK signaling pathway because it has been reported can regulate cell renewal (Fig 6A) [21]. The cGMP analog was able to rescue the sphere formation capacity of Prps2-silenced 4TO7Lung cells, which could be further inhibited by the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) (Fig 6B). In 4TO7Ori cells, cGMP analog-enhanced sphere formation capacity could be also blocked by MEKi (Fig 6C).\n\nBesides, MEKi could inhibit not only the expression of stemness signature genes in highly metastatic 4TO7Lung cells (Fig 6D) but also cGMP-boosted stemness genes in low metastatic 4TO7Ori and Prps2-silenced 4TO7Lung cells (Fig 6E and 6F, S4G Fig). In addition, MEKi greatly reduced the side population of 4TO7Lung cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6G and 6H) and blocked the cGMP-induced side population of 4TO7Ori cells (Fig 6I and 6J). Together, these data supported that cGMP/PKG activated downstream MEK-ERK signaling pathway to increase the CSC-like properties of breast cancer cells to sustain their metastasis.\n\nIncreased UA level correlates with cancer progression in breast cancer patients\n\nLast but not least, we evaluated the UA levels in patients with breast cancer, because as a downstream metabolite of purine metabolism, its level always fluctuates with nucleotide de novo synthesis activity. As expected, we found that in 337 breast cancer patients, UA level is highly elevated in stage IV patients who have distant metastases (Fig 7A). The linear correlation analysis also revealed that the plasma UA level is correlated with patients’ poor prognosis (Fig 7B). We found that every 1-μM increase in plasma UA after clinical intervention was associated with a 0.8% increase in the risk of rapid poor prognosis (Table 1), and when compared patients with different level of UA changes, the risk of poor prognosis in the highest quartile was 2.427 (95% CI 1.126, 5.235, P = 0.02371), which means that the more UA increased after clinical intervention, the greater risk of poor prognosis in patients (Fig 7C, Table 2). In addition, based on the analysis of TCGA database, we found that the high expression of genes involved in UA production roughly correlates with poor survival (Fig 7D). These data suggested that as a downstream metabolite of purine metabolism, UA level has the potential to be utilized to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer patients.\n\nAll together, our study illustrated a new metabolic feature during the lung metastasis of breast cancer, i.e., enhanced nucleotide de novo synthesis regulated by PRPS2 leads to more cGMP formation, consequently activating cGMP-dependent PKG and downstream MEK-ERK signaling pathway to increase the stemness of breast cancer cells and the metastasis (Fig 8).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe role of de novo synthesis in lung metastasis of breast cancer\n\nWe established a breast cancer metastasis model by tail vein injecting with less-metastatic cancer cells 4TO7 to screen high-metastatic cells from lung metastatic foci in mice. This model imitated circulating breast cancer cells relocalized in distant organs and colonized to form new metastatic foci. With metabolomics analysis, we found that high metastatic breast cancer cells showed increases in many metabolisms, including nucleotide metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism. During the development of breast cancer, tumor cells need certain amounts of nucleotides. Increased de novo synthesis can provide more nucleotides to support tumor development. However, the mechanism of the activation of de novo synthesis is still not clear, even though it has been reported that PRPS2 translation can be regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway [17, 22, 23].\n\nThe role of cGMP in lung metastasis of breast cancer\n\nIt has been noticed that deregulation of cGMP signaling is an important step in the tumorigenesis process in at least a subset of breast cancers [24–27]. Our findings pointed that cGMP, likely as a consequence of the increased de novo synthesis, can promote cGMP-dependent protein kinase PKG to active downstream pathways [20, 28]. More importantly, as cGMP signaling is a common signaling pathway in all types of breast cancer and largely independent of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or HER-2 receptor, targeting this pathway is a promising and novel approach to improve triple-negative breast cancer survival rates.\n\nThe role of PRPS2 in lung metastasis of breast cancer\n\nThere are 2 PRPS isoforms in mice, PRPS1 and PRPS2. PRPS2 shares about 95% amino acid identity with the PRPS1 isoform [19]. In our transcriptomics profiling, PRPS2 showed large variation, which suggested its exclusive role in regulating de novo synthesis of breast cancer cells. This may due to its high sensitivity to fluctuation of its substrate, ATP, whose levels are elevated in many tumor cells [29]. Nontargeted inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis have been utilized as chemotherapeutic drugs for many years [30, 31]. However, these inhibitors produce severe toxicities in normal tissues. Our findings found that PRPS2 can regulate nucleotide de novo synthesis to change breast cancer cell stem–like properties in the metastasis, strongly suggesting PRPS2 can be a new specific therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.\n\nThe role of increased UA in breast cancer metastasis\n\nThe UA is not only a metabolite of enhanced purine metabolism but also may function as a regulator of cancer cells. It has been reported that UA provides an antioxidant defense in humans [32]. As the lungs are exposed daily to oxidants generated either endogenously or exogenously [33], increased UA levels in breast cancer cells may protect metastatic cancer cells against oxidative damage and in favor of their recolonization. Thus, our finding may reveal a novel mechanism of cancer cells overcoming environmental challenges in their metastasis to the lung.\n\nIn summary, metabolism in cells plays many roles beyond producing metabolites for energy generation and anabolism [34]. Metabolism alternation may influence many cellular programs, as metabolites regulate many intracellular balances and signaling pathway. Our findings further suggested the great importance of nucleotide de novo synthesis in the regulation of cancer cell stemness, adding evidence to the crosstalk of cancer cell cellular programs and metabolic networks.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthics statement\n\nAll experimental procedures performed on mice were approved by the Nankai University Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number NKU20160816). All experiments complied with the guidelines for the management of laboratory of Nankai University, P R China.\n\nCells\n\nMouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 and 4TO7 were obtained from Ralph A. Reisfeld’s laboratory. Cells from lung metastatic foci were harvested and digested using PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.2% collagenase IV (17104019, Gibc) at 37°C for 2 hours after tail vein injection with 4TO7Ori cells in 6–8-week-old females. After 3 repeats, 4TO7Lung cells were obtained from the lung metastatic foci.\n\nVector construction and virus production shRNA templates targeting Prps2, Prkg, and scrambled control (LacZ) were cloned into the lentivirus-based plasmid pLV-H1-EF1α-puro (SORT-B19, Biosettia Inc.) (Table 3). 4T1 and 4TO7Lung cells were infected with lentivirus carrying RNAis for 24 hours and cultured for 48 hours, followed by selection using 10 μg/ml puromycin.\n\nAnimal\n\nAll mice were maintained in an IVC library system at Nankai University. Tumor cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM media and injected subcutaneously into the right armpit areas or tail vein of 6-week-old BALB/c females. Tumor initiation and progression were observed every 3 days.\n\nClinical information\n\nPatients’ information (n = 337) were collected from the Department of Oncology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China. Based on the condition of patients after treatment, patients were divided into improvement group and deterioration group. Conditions for improvement included a reduction in lesions by radiographic evidence, reduction of at least 2 tumor-specific markers, and a clinical response evaluation by RECIST criteria resulting in CR, PR, or SD. Deteriorating conditions include recurrence, new metastases, radiographic evidence of enlarged lesions, elevation of at least 2 tumor-specific markers, and clinical response evaluation by RECIST criteria resulting in PD.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nSurvival curves were plotted using the Kaplan–Meier method. The association between prognosis and the changes in UA levels before and after treatment was tested by linear regression analyses. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated via univariate analysis to test the relationships between the changes of UA levels before and after treatment and the risk of prognosis.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using Empower (www.empowerstats.com, X&amp;Y solutions, Inc., Boston, MA).\n\nAll data were shown as means ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed by a Student t test using GraphPad Prism software (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). Statistical significance was indicated by *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, and ***P ≤ 0.001.\n\nLimiting dilution analysis\n\nshControl-4TO7Lung, shPrps2-4TO7Lung, 4TO7Ori and 4TO7Lung cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM media at limiting dilution condition (103, 104, and 105 per 100 ul) and injected into tail vein of 6–8-week-female mice, respectively (n = 6–10 per group).\n\nGene expression assessment by RT-qPCR\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIeasy total RNA extraction reagent (10606ES60, Yeasen) and reverse transcribed (1 μg for each group) using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (M1708, Promega). The levels of mRNA expression were quantified by RT-qPCR using Hieff UNICON qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (11198ES08, Yeasen) after 45 cycles of PCR includes denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 45 seconds, and elongation at 72°C for 30 seconds in each cycle. The relative expression levels of genes were determined after normalization to β-Actin. The sequences of the primers used for qPCR were listed in Table 4.\n\nProtein extraction and western blot\n\nProteins were extracted from cells using cell lysis buffer (9803, Cell Signaling Technology) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (5892970001, Merck). The following primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000: ACTB (YM3028, Immunoway), PRPS2 (27024-1-AP, Proteintech), ADSS (16373-1-AP, Proteintech), GMPS (16376-1-AP, Proteintech), PFAS (HPA022886, Sigma‐Aldrich), GART (sc-166379, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CAD (16617-1-AP, Proteintech), KLF4 (11880-1-AP, Proteintech), OCT4 (11263-1-AP, Proteintech), SOX2 (11064-1-AP, Proteintech), NANOG (14259-1-AP, Proteintech), VASP (13472-1-AP, Proteintech), Phospho-VASP (Ser239) (3114, Cell Signaling Technology), ERK (sc-514302, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and P-ERK (Thr202 + Tyr204) (BS-3016R, Bioss).\n\nThe secondary antibodies anti-mouse IgG-HRP (ZLI-2305, Zsgb-Bio, dilution 1:5,000) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibodies (ZLI-2301, Zsgb-Bio, dilution 1:5,000) were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. ECL detection reagent (WBKLS0500, Millipore) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions\n\nHE, immunohistochemistry, and IF\n\nTissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 hours. For HE staining, tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 4-μm intervals (Leica). For immunohistochemistry (IHC), tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and permeated using Triton X 100 (T8200, Solarbio) and followed by antigen retrieval using EDTA Antigen Retrieval solution (c1034, Solarbio). The primary antibodies used for IHC and IF were the same as WB (dilution 1:200). Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories), Streptavidin, Horseradish Peroxidase, R.T.U. (SA-5704, Vector Laboratories), and DAB kit (ZLI-9017, Zsgb-Bio) were used for IHC. Alexa Fluor 488—Conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG (ZF0512, Zsgb-Bio), Alexa Fluor 594—Conjugated Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (ZF0516, Zsgb-Bio) and DAPI (D9542, Sigma‐Aldrich) were used for IF. Fluoro-Gel Mounting Medium with TES Buffer (17985–30, Electron Microscopy Sciences) was used for protecting the fluorescence.\n\nFlow cytometry\n\nCells for flow cytometry analysis were harvested and resuspended in PBS with 1% FBS at a density of 1.0×106 cells/ml. Hoechst 33342 (B2261, Sigma‐Aldrich), verapamil (V4629, Sigma‐Aldrich), and reserpine (R0875, Sigma‐Aldrich) were used at a final concentration of 32 μM (Hoechst 33342), 8 μM (verapamil), and 8 μM (reserpine) for side population analysis. PE rat anti-mouse CD24 (553262, BD Biosciences) and FITC rat anti-mouse CD44 (553133, BD Biosciences) were diluted to 1:100 for the staining.\n\nELISA analysis\n\ncGMP (E-EL-0083) and cAMP (E-EL-0056) were measured using ELISA kits (Elabscience), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nSphere formation assay\n\nCells were collected and resuspended in stem cell medium, serum-free DMEM F12 Media (01-170-1A, Biological Industries) supplemented with 20 ng/ml mEGF (PMG8045, Thermo Scientific), 20 ng/ml bFGF recombinant human protein (13256029, Thermo Scientific), and 1X B27 supplement (17504044, Thermo Scientific). Cells were filtered to single-cell suspension and cultured in the stem cell medium on 6-well plates (3471, Corning) at a density of 1,000 cells per well for 5–7 days.\n\ncGMP analog (50 μM) and MEK inhibitor (0.01 μM) were replenished every 24–36 hours as needed.\n\nMetabolomics profiling\n\nThe frozen cellular samples (2.25×107 cells/sample, 6 replications for every group) were thawed at 4°C and then mixed with 1 mL of precooled methanol/acetonitrile/ddH2O (2:2:1, v/v). Treated the mixture with sonication at 4°C for 30 minutes and left at −20°C for 10 minutes. Collected the supernatant after 20 minutes of centrifuge (Eppendorf 5430R) (14,000 g, 4°C). The supernatant was lyophilized under a vacuum and stored at –80°C until redissolution in 100 μL of an acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) solvent for ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography equipped with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC–Q-TOF/MS) analysis.\n\nUHPLC−Q-TOF-MS analysis was performed with Agilent 1290 Infinity LC UHPLC (1290 Infinity LC, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) combined with a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Triple TOF 5600+; AB SCIEX, Concord, Canada). An ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm column) was used. The column, which has a 2-μL injection volume, was maintained at 25°C and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of A: ddH2O + 25 mM ammonium hydroxide + 25 mM ammonium acetate (70221, Sigma), and B: acetonitrile (1499230–935, Merck). The quality-control (QC) samples that were prepared by pooling 10 μL of each sample were placed into the column at regular intervals in the analysis sequence.\n\nFor MS detection, the following ESI source conditions were used: ion source gas 1 (Gas1) of 60 psi, ion source gas 2 (Gas2) of 60 psi, curtain gas (CUR) of 30 psi, source temperature of 600°C, and ion spray voltage floating (ISVF) of ±5,500 V (positive [ESI+] and negative [ESI−] ion modes). The MS properties were set as follows: TOF MS scan m/z range, 60–1,000 Da; product ion scan m/z range, 25–1,000 Da, TOF MS scan accumulation time; 0.20 s/spectra, product ion scan accumulation time, 0.05 s/spectra. The MS/MS data were acquired in the information-dependent acquisition (IDA) with the high-sensitivity mode. The declustering potential (DP) was ±60 V, and the collision energy (CE) was 35 V ± 15 eV. IDA was set as follows: exclude isotopes within 4 Da; candidate ions to monitor per cycle, 6. Meanwhile, the QC sample was analyzed with every batch of 5 samples to monitor precision and stability of the system and the data quality.\n\nThe raw data generated by UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS were converted into mzML format files using the ProteoWizard (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/). The files were subsequently processed using the XCMS online software (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/landing_page.php?pgcontent=mainPage) for nonlinear alignment in the time domain, automatic integration, and extraction of the peak intensities with the default measurement settings [35]. MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca) was employed for the statistical analysis [36]. The significance of the metabolites was ranked using the variable importance in projection (VIP) score (&gt;1) from the partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model. Specific metabolites were compared between lung metastasis group and original group.\n\nMetabolic flux analysis\n\nMouse breast cancer cells (3×106) were seeded in 10-cm dishes and cultured with the glucose-deficient DMEM supplemented with 25 mM U-[13C]-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for 24 hours. For metabolite extraction, after washing cells with PBS buffer for 3 times, put the plates on dry ice and add 2 ml of 80% (v/v) prechilled methanol. Incubate the plates at −80°C for 2 hours. Scrape the plates on dry ice and transfer the cell lysate/methanol mixture to a 15-ml tube. After centrifuging at 14,000g for 20 minutes at 4°C, the metabolite-containing supernatant was transferred to a new tube and lyophilized at room temperature. The pallet was dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride solution and incubated at 65°C for 4 hours. The concentrations of extracted metabolites were normalized to the protein concentration measured from the guanidine hydrochloride solution using the BCA assay. Samples were analyzed using TSQ Quantiva mass spectrometry (ThermoFisher, CA) at Technology Center for Protein Sciences at Tsinghua University according to the manual instruction.\n\nTranscriptomics profiling\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using the method described previously and was quantified using a Nano Drop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Library construction and sequencing were performed on BGIseq500 platform (BGI-Shenzhen, China). After filtering, clean reads are mapped to reference using HISAT [37] and Bowtie2 [38] tools. Gene’s expression level is quantified by a software package called RSEM [38]. NOISeq method was used to do the analysis of DEGs screening.\n\nSupporting information"
