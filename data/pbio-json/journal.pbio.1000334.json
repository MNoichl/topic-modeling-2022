  "abstract": "An engineered protein prevents aggregation of the Aβ peptide and facilitates clearance of Aβ from the brain in a fruit fly model of Alzheimer's disease.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nOf the neurodegenerative disorders that have been linked to protein misfolding and aggregation [1], Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common [2],[3]. Transgenic animal models have shown that aggregation of the Alzheimer β-peptide (Aβ) causes memory impairment [4],[5] and cognitive deficits [6] similar to those seen in patients suffering from AD. Aβ aggregation precedes neuritic changes [7], and there is a quantitative correlation between the propensities of mutant forms of Aβ to aggregate and their neurotoxicity [8]. In vitro aggregation of Aβ proceeds from the initial association of monomers into oligomeric, but still soluble, assemblies that ultimately form highly structured and insoluble amyloid fibrils [1],[9],[10],[11]. Evidence suggests that the primary neurotoxic species are the soluble oligomeric aggregates [4],[5],[12],[13] and that a fundamental building block may be dimeric Aβ species [14]. However, despite this progress, the details of Aβ aggregation in vivo, the structure of toxic aggregates, the mechanism of toxicity, and in particular, the relationship between aggregate formation and peptide clearance are not known.\n\nWe set out to investigate a novel approach to study the dynamics of Aβ aggregation in vitro and neurotoxicity or degradation in vivo by using a conformation-specific Aβ binding protein, the ZAβ3 Affibody [15],[16]. Affibody molecules are engineered binding proteins, which are selected by phage display from libraries based on the three-helix Z domain [17],[18]. The ZAβ3 Affibody was selected [15] to bind specifically to Aβ monomers with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant Kd≈17 nM) [16]. It forms a disulfide-linked dimer to which Aβ binds and folds by induced fit [19] into a hairpin conformation such that its two aggregation-prone hydrophobic faces become buried within a tunnel-like cavity in the ZAβ3 dimer [16],[19]. The specificity and well-characterized structural features of ZAβ3 binding to Aβ make it an ideal candidate for studying the effects of Aβ monomer binding in vivo. We find that the presence of the Affibody molecule, achieved by co-expression, can eliminate Aβ neurotoxicity in a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) model of AD [20],[21], and we used biochemical and biophysical experiments to identify the molecular mechanism by which this process occurs.\n\nResults/Discussion\n\nElimination of Aβ Neurotoxicity In Vivo\n\nWe first generated Drosophila strains transgenic for ZAβ3. As ZAβ3 is most effective in binding Aβ when it is in its dimeric form, we also generated Drosophila in which two copies of ZAβ3 are connected head-to-tail—(ZAβ3)2—to enable the disulfide-linked dimer to form more readily. Drosophila transgenic for the wild-type Z domain were used as controls. These three Affibody fly lines were then each crossed with Drosophila transgenic for Aβ42, Aβ42e22g [22], or Aβ40, and the co-expression of both transgenes together in the brain or in the eye was initiated by crossing with appropriate driver flies [20],[21].\n\nExpression of Aβ42e22g in the brain of Drosophila causes rapid neurodegeneration resulting in a drastic reduction in lifespan from 38 (±1.8) to 9 (±0.5) days, consistent with the findings of previous studies [8]. Co-expression of ZAβ3 with Aβ42e22g, however, increases the lifespan to 20 (±0.2) days. Strikingly, if the-head-to-tail dimer (ZAβ3)2 is co-expressed with Aβ42e22g, the toxic effects of the peptide are yet further reduced and the lifespan increases to 31 (±0.8) days, which is almost as long as in wild-type controls (Figure 1A, Table S1) and indicates that the neurotoxicity of Aβ has been almost entirely abolished. Co-expression of the Z domain, which has no affinity for Aβ, does not affect Aβ42e22g toxicity, demonstrating that the rescue of Aβ toxicity in vivo is specific to ZAβ3. Co-expression of ZAβ3 with wild-type Aβ42 also significantly prolongs the lifespan of these flies (from 28, ±0.4, to 32, ±0.7, days). Again, the (ZAβ3)2 head-to-tail-dimer is even more effective, completely eliminating the toxicity associated with Aβ42 (lifespan 40, ±1.2, days), whereas the Z domain control has no effect (Figure 1B). Expression of the less aggregation-prone Aβ40 has no effect on lifespan, and none of the Affibody molecules or the control significantly affected the lifespan of flies expressing Aβ40 or wild-type Drosophila (Figure 1C and 1D).\n\nThe ability of (ZAβ3)2 to abolish the toxic effects of Aβ42e22g was confirmed physiologically by its ability to abolish the abnormal eye morphology associated with Aβ42e22g expression in the photoreceptors in the fly (Figure 2).\n\nClearance of Aβ from the Drosophila Brain\n\nTo determine the mechanism by which ZAβ3 mediates suppression of Aβ toxicity, we assessed the levels of Aβ42 in the brains of flies co-expressing Aβ42e22g and either ZAβ3, (ZAβ3)2, or the Z domain by Western blotting. Fly brains were homogenized in 1% SDS, subjected to electrophoretic separation, and probed using an antibody against the N-terminus of Aβ, which detailed structural studies reveal remains exposed in the Aβ:ZAβ3 complex [16]. SDS soluble Aβ can clearly be detected in flies expressing Aβ42e22g, but it is absent in flies co-expressing ZAβ3 or (ZAβ3)2 (Figure 3A). The specificity of this effect is confirmed by the continued presence of the Aβ42e22g in flies that co-express the non-binding Z domain.\n\nThe ZAβ3:Aβ complex is stable in 1% SDS (B. Macao, unpublished), and Aβ remaining in complexes or in SDS insoluble aggregates in the fly brain might therefore not be detectable by Western blot. In order to address this possibility, fly brains expressing Aβ42e22g with or without (ZAβ3)2, ZAβ3 or the Z domain were homogenized in 5 M GdmCl, conditions known to dissociate both Aβ aggregates and Aβ:ZAβ3 complexes. The total level of Aβ42e22g in these extracts was then measured by a sensitive ELISA assay (Figure 3B). Flies expressing both (ZAβ3)2 and Aβ42e22g show a 97% (±3%) reduction in the concentration of Aβ42e22g compared to flies co-expressing Aβ42e22g and the inert Z domain (the most appropriate control for the non-specific effects of expressing a second transgene on the levels of Aβ). Decreased Aβ42e22g levels in the presence of different Affibody constructs correlate well with corresponding reduction in neurotoxicity measured by the survival assay (Figure 1).\n\nThe prevention of Aβ42e22g aggregation by ZAβ3 and (ZAβ3)2 is demonstrated by immunohistochemical detection of Aβ42e22g in whole mount brain preparations analyzed by confocal microscopy. Flies expressing Aβ42e22g under the control of the OK107-Gal4 driver, which drives expression in a subset of adult neurons, contain abundant deposits in the brain recognized by the anti-Aβ 6E10 antibody, whereas flies co-expressing Aβ42e22g and (ZAβ3)2 have almost no visible 6E10 immunoreactive deposits (Figure 3C). In good agreement with the results of the ELISA analysis, co-expression of ZAβ3 results in a significant reduction in the burden of aggregates but does not result in their complete removal, whereas co-expression of the Z domain gives levels of Aβ deposits similar to those present in flies expressing Aβ42e22g.\n\nIn order to determine whether the presence of Aβ42e22g had altered the levels of ZAβ3 or (ZAβ3)2 present in the fly brain, brain homogenates were analyzed using either anti-cMyc antibodies to detect ZAβ3 or anti-Affibody antibodies to detect (ZAβ3)2; both dimeric Affibody molecules can be observed as 12 kDa dimers under non-reducing conditions. The levels of these Affibody species are not detectably altered in flies co-expressing Aβ42e22g (Figure 3D) despite the marked reduction of the levels of soluble Aβ42e22g (Figure 3A). While this experiment suggests that Aβ clearance could be occurring without the corresponding clearance of its binding partner ZAβ3, the quantities seen by Western blot represent the equilibrium levels of these two proteins, and so would not detect any turnover in ZAβ3 that may also be occurring.\n\nWe have established that the reductions in the levels of Aβ42e22g peptide in the fly brain are not due to altered gene regulation in flies co-expressing Z, ZAβ3, or (ZAβ3)2, because the levels of Aβ42e22g transcription are not significantly reduced in any case (Figure 3E).\n\nIn summary, ZAβ3 causes a reduction in Aβ42e22g levels by actively promoting its clearance from the brain. The clearance does not involve any specific antibody-mediated process, since Drosophila lacks an adaptive immune system [23]. In order to determine at which stages of the Aβ aggregation process the ZAβ3 Affibody can intervene, we analyzed the effects of ZAβ3 on the dynamic interconversion of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar Aβ species in vitro.\n\nInhibition of Aβ Amyloid Fibril Formation In Vitro\n\nSequestration of the hydrophobic regions of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Figure 4A and Figure S1) allows ZAβ3 to inhibit amyloid fibril formation completely, even that of the extremely aggregation-prone Aβ42e22g variant, as judged by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays indicative of amyloid fibril formation (Figure 4B–D, Figure S2, and Figure S3). The addition of ZAβ3 to Aβ40 or Aβ42 aggregation reactions has the same effect on the aggregation kinetics as reducing the Aβ concentration by the equivalent amount (Figure 4C and Figure S3A), demonstrating that inhibition of fibril formation occurs by sequestration of monomeric Aβ. When a molar excess of ZAβ3 is added at different times during the aggregation process, it effectively inhibits all further aggregation (Figure 4B and Figure S3B), indicating that not only does ZAβ3 effectively block aggregation even after its initiation, but also that monomeric Aβ is accessible for binding throughout the process of fibril formation.\n\nKinetics of Amyloid Fibril Dissolution\n\nWe noted, however, during the course of the experiments that the ThT fluorescence signal tends to fall after the addition of ZAβ3 at advanced stages of the fibril formation reaction, suggesting that ZAβ3 may also act to reverse the aggregation process (Figure 4D and Figure S3C). To determine the kinetics of fibril dissolution by ZAβ3 in vitro, we set up experiments in which Aβ40 monomers dissociating from pre-formed fibrils are captured by ZAβ3. We used 15N-labelled Aβ40 for these experiments so that monomeric Aβ40 in complex with ZAβ3 could be identified by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at low micromolar concentrations. The large fibrillar aggregates of 15N-Aβ40 (Figure 4E) did not generate an observable NMR spectrum even after 24 h of data collection, as expected, due to slow molecular tumbling and no highly mobile residues. The addition of ZAβ3, however, generated resonances from ZAβ3-bound monomeric 15N-Aβ40, indicating a gradual dissolution of the fibrils (Figure 4F and Figure S4). Only a small fraction of the Aβ40, however, dissociates from the fibrils over the first three weeks; thereafter the dissolution process becomes very slow, even for fibrils fragmented by sonication (Figure 4G). Still, under these conditions the observed level of dissolution does not represent the equilibrium state, as the pre-formed Aβ40:ZAβ3 complex is stable in the presence of Aβ40 fibrils (Figure S5). Hence, even though binding of the ZAβ3 Affibody to monomeric Aβ40 can act to dissolve fibrils, the dissociation kinetics are too slow, at least in vitro, for dissolution to be achievable in practice under ambient conditions.\n\nInhibition and Dissolution of Aβ Oligomers\n\nIn order to determine the critical issue of whether or not ZAβ3 can prevent the formation of smaller Aβ aggregates (oligomers), we examined their formation in vitro by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the presence and absence of ZAβ3 (Figure 5A to 5D and Figure S6). Oligomeric species [24] appear within hours in solutions of Aβ42, prepared by dilution from alkaline conditions [25], where the monomeric species is initially dominant. The partitioning between monomeric and oligomeric Aβ then reaches an interim steady state after ∼10 h before the onset of the formation of amyloid fibrils (Figure 5A). By contrast, in the presence of the ZAβ3, oligomer formation is completely inhibited (Figure 5B), a result that can be attributed to the sequestration of Aβ42 within the complex formed with the Affibody.\n\nIsolated Aβ42 oligomers contain elements of well-defined β-sheet structure as measured by circular dichroism (CD), but the β-sheet content is lower than in mature fibrils (Figure 5E). Their stability is also lower as isolated oligomers dissociate into monomers and convert into amyloid fibrils (Figure 5C). Addition of the ZAβ3 Affibody results in dissolution of the oligomers after a few days (Figure 5D, 5F, and 5G and Figure S7). This is because binding of monomeric Aβ acts to shift the dynamic monomer-oligomer equilibrium such that the oligomer population is reduced, and NMR (Figure 5H) and SEC analyses (Figure S6) consequently also reveal monomeric Aβ42 in complex with ZAβ3.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe presence of the ZAβ3 Affibody in vivo results in the effective inhibition of Aβ toxicity and the promotion of Aβ degradation. These effects can be attributed to the ability of the ZAβ3 Affibody to act in three distinct ways on the Aβ aggregation process. First, monomeric Aβ will be sequestered by ZAβ3, the result of which is that toxic Aβ aggregates will not be able to form in the brain. Second, if Aβ aggregation were to occur, it can be slowed, halted, and even reversed by the action of ZAβ3 on the dynamic Aβ monomer-aggregate equilibria. Furthermore, the presence of ZAβ3 not only prevents or reverses Aβ aggregate formation, it also promotes clearance from the brain. We envisage that this could occur either by intracellular lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, or alternatively by the secretion and uptake by phagocytic cells of the ZAβ3:Aβ complex.\n\nThe results furthermore demonstrate how engineered binding proteins, such as Affibody molecules, that target specific protein conformations can be used to gain important insights into the dynamics of the Aβ aggregation process and its toxic consequences both in vivo and in vitro.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nFly Genetics\n\nDrosophila melanogaster transgenic for Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ42e22g have been described previously [20]. Drosophila transgenic for the Z domain, ZAβ3, and the (ZAβ3)2 head-to-tail dimer were created by standard p element mediated germ line transformation using pUAST (Brand and Perrimon) as the expression vector. Affibody cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pUAST using EcoR1 and Xho1, except for (ZAβ3)2, which was cloned between EcoR1 and Xba1 sites. Each transgene was preceded by the same secretion signal peptide (MASKVSILLLLTVHLLAAQTFAQ), derived from the Drosophila necrotic gene, in order to target its expression to the secretory pathway. Transgenes were injected into w1118 embryos.\n\nDrosophila transgenic for Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ42e22g were each crossed with Drosophila transgenic for Z, ZAβ3, and (ZAβ3)2 to create stable double transgenic stocks. Expression of the transgenes was achieved using the UAS-Gal4 system. UAS-Tg flies were crossed with flies expressing Gal4 under the control of either a neuronal promoter (elavc155 or OK107) or eye specific promoter (gmr). All fly crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal/agar fly food in humidified incubators. Crosses to generate flies expressing Affibody molecules or Aβ were performed at 29°C.\n\nSurvival Assays\n\nSurvival assays were performed as described previously [20]. Briefly, 100 flies of each genotype were collected, divided into tubes of 10 flies, and kept at 29°C. The number of live flies was counted every 2–3 days and recorded. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between genotypes were assessed using the log-rank test.\n\nRough Eye Phenotype\n\nTransgenes were expressed in the eye by crossing with gmr-Gal4 flies. Crosses were performed at 29°C. Flies were collected on the day of eclosion and sputter coated using 20 nM of Au/Pd in a Polaron E5000. SEM images were collected using a Philips XL30 Microscope.\n\nProtein Extraction and Western Blotting\n\nFifty flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and decapitated for each genotype. Fly heads were homogenized in PBS/1% SDS containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science, UK). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,100 g for 1 min to remove insoluble material, and the supernatants were collected for analysis. Protein concentration in each supernatant was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Biorad). Equal quantities of protein for each genotype were loaded on to 4%–12% Bis/Tris SDS PAGE gels (Invitrogen) for detection of Affibody molecules and 4%–12% Tris/glycine SDS PAGE gels (Invitrogen) for detection of Aβ. Electrophoresis was performed under non-reducing conditions, and protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. ZAβ3 was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, Abcam), and (ZAβ3)2 was detected using a goat anti-Affibody antibody (Abcam). Aβ was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody directed against the N terminus of Aβ (6E10, Signet). All blots were developed using Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity ECL substrate (Pierce).\n\nTotal Aβ ELISA\n\nHeads from flies expressing Aβ42e22g with or without Affibody domains were subjected to mechanical homogenization in 5 M GdmCl, 50 mM Hepes, and 5 mM EDTA followed by 4 min of sonication in a water bath. Homogenates were centrifuged for 7 min at 12,100 g to pellet any GdmCl insoluble material. Supernatants were diluted in 50 mM Hepes and 5 mM EDTA with protease inhibitors to a final concentration of 1 M GdmCl. A sandwich ELISA was performed on the supernatants using biotinylated 6E10 (Signet) and a C terminal Aβx-42-specific antibody 21F12 (kind gift of D. Schenk, Elan). Protein levels were measured using a Sector Imager (Meso Scale Discovery) and normalized to a percentage of the level obtained for flies expressing Aβ42e22g alone.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nFlies of all genotypes were crossed with OK107-Gal4 flies (Bloomington Stock No. 854) to drive expression in a subset of neurons that includes, but is not limited to, the mushroom bodies. For each genotype fly brains were dissected in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. The brains were then washed three times in PBS/0.05% Triton X-100 and blocked in 5% w/v bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Fly brains were incubated overnight in mouse anti-Aβ (6E10, Signet) diluted 1∶1000 in blocking buffer. After three further washes in PBS/0.05% Triton X-100, brains were then incubated in goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 546 (Invitrogen) and counterstained with TOTO-3 (Invitrogen) to detect nuclei before mounting in Vectashield (Vectorlabs) anti-fade mounting medium.\n\nConfocal Microscopy\n\nConfocal serial scanning images were acquired at 2 or 4 µm intervals (for high magnification and low magnification images, respectively) using a Nikon Eclipse C1si on Nikon E90i upright stand (Nikon). The image stacks were projected using ImageJ (version 1.42k), and the resulting composite images were processed using Photoshop CS4 software (Adobe Systems).\n\nTranscription Assay\n\nConcentrations of mRNA were determined using quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR). Twenty-five flies per genotype were collected and snap frozen in liquid N2. RNA was extracted from each group of 25 fly heads using TriZol followed by DNAse treatment to remove residual genomic DNA and reverse transcription to produce cDNA. Each sample was subjected to two separate quantitative PCR reactions to detect Aβ mRNA and the control gene Actin5c. Real time amplification of cDNA was monitored using SYBR Green fluorescence in a Bio-Rad iQ Cycler.\n\nProtein Samples for Biophysical Analysis\n\nZAβ3 was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere [16]. Aβ peptides were obtained from a commercial source (rpeptide, Bogart, GA, USA), synthesized in-house, or produced (with an N-terminal methionine) by recombinant co-expression of Aβ and ZAβ3 in E. coli [26]. Experiments were carried out in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, except for the NMR experiments where NaCl was not included, and pH 7.2. 10 µM ThT was added prior to fluorescence measurements.\n\nAβ Fibril Formation\n\nFibril formation assays were carried out as described previously [16]. TEM images were obtained using a LEO 912 AB Omega microscope. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter.\n\nAβ Fibril Dissolution\n\nFibrils were prepared from Aβ40 at a concentration of 100 µM with the same set-up and conditions as for the fibril formation assays, but in the absence of ThT. After 3 days of incubation at 37°C, fibrils were isolated by centrifugation at 16,000 g. To remove any residual soluble peptide, fibrils were washed by resuspension in buffer F [20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% sodium azide, complete protease inhibitor (Roche; at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer)], followed by centrifugation. Fibrils were resuspended in buffer F supplemented with 10% D2O to a final concentration of 300 µM Aβ40 and investigated by 15N HSQC NMR with 24 h of data collection on a Varian Inova 900 MHz NMR spectrometer (equipped with a cryogenic probe) or on a Varian Inova 800 MHz spectrometer. The intensity of resonances originating from bound Aβ40 detected in the presence of 325 µM of unlabeled ZAβ3 was followed over time by recording a series of 24 h 15N HSQC NMR spectra. Five µM of 15N-ZAβ3 served as an internal concentration reference, assuming identical NMR-sensitivities of the intense resonances of the three C-terminal residues of bound Aβ40 and free ZAβ3. Sonication was achieved by placing the NMR tube with the fibril sample into a Misonix water bath sonicator for 2 min before acquisition of NMR data.\n\nAβ Oligomer Formation and Dissolution\n\nOligomer formation was induced by adjusting the pH of alkaline (pH∼10.5) solutions of Aβ42 (concentration ≤100 µM) in 20 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM sodium chloride to pH 7.2 (with 1 M HCl) [25]. The samples were incubated at 21°C and oligomer formation was monitored with SEC and ThT fluorescence. Fifty µl (for analytical runs) or 1 ml (for preparative oligomer isolation) aliquots were injected onto an ÄKTA Explorer system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a Superdex 75 10/300 column, and the elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 220 nm. Preparative oligomer isolation was carried out 4–20 h after induction of oligomer formation and yielded oligomer solutions at 10–20 µM total Aβ42 concentration. The elution volumes of the ZAβ3:Aβ42 complex and free ZAβ3 were determined in separate runs of the isolated complex or free Affibody, respectively, and conformed to previous SEC studies [19]. The amounts of Aβ42 in the monomeric, oligomeric, or ZAβ3-bound fraction were determined from the elution peak areas obtained by integration using the Unicorn software provided with the chromatography system. The data were normalized by setting to unity the sum of the oligomer and monomer peak areas in the first SEC profiles (at t = 0.2 h for oligomer formation in Figure S6A, and at t = 0.5 h for oligomer dissolution in Figure S6C). The fraction of high molecular weight aggregates that did not enter the column bed was calculated as the difference between unity and the sum of the monomer and oligomer fractions. The fraction of ZAβ3-bound Aβ42 shown in Figure 5D was obtained by comparison of the integrated ZAβ3:Aβ42/free ZAβ3 peak area with those obtained in calibration runs of free ZAβ3 (set to 0) and ZAβ3:Aβ42 complex (set to 1) using the same protein concentrations as in the dissolution experiment. The fraction of Aβ42 bound to ZAβ3 was determined by 15N HSQC NMR employing an internal concentration standard.\n\nSupporting Information"
