PLoS Biol 6(2): e28. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0060028\n\nThe content of the published Dataset S1 was incorrect, due to a procedural error when the file was created. A corrected version of this file is now available. The figures and analysis presented elsewhere in the research article are not affected, as these were created from the master copy of the data rather than the supporting file."
