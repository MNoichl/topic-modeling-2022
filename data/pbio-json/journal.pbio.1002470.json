  "fullText": "The authors would like to make the following clarifications regarding the manuscript figures, as well as provide a corrected version of Figure S1, provided here as S1 Fig.\n\nThe authors would like to clarify that some of the figures in this article contain juxtaposed northern blot panels depicting distinct biological comparisons that have not been separated by vertical splice lines between the juxtaposed panels. Although splice lines were not indicated in those published figures, black lines or brackets were superimposed above panels to identify the distinct sets of gel lanes. The lack of splice lines does not affect any of the conclusions drawn from the experiments.\n\nThe authors would also like to clarify some intentional duplications in the figures, which were done for purposes of comparison. Panels depicting the YRA1, C-672, N-372, N-311, N-712, and C-943 northern blots in Figure 3 were included in the more extensive deletion series blots of Figures S1, S2, S3, S6 and S7 and the blot for the C-672/R-CDE synonymously named allele is included in both Figures 3 and 4 (referred to as C-672 in Figure 3 and as R-CDE in Figure 4).\n\nThe authors acknowledge the intentional duplication of the Figure 5F N400 panel in Figures S1 and S6, once again for purposes of comparison. The Figure S1 panel should have been associated with the corresponding SCR1 blot shown in Figure 5F. Figure S1 has now been corrected accordingly and is provided here as S1 Fig. This correction does not affect the conclusions drawn in the study.\n\nSupporting Information"
