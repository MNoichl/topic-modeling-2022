  "abstract": "Tracking of ancestral histone proteins over multiple generations of genome\n                    replication in yeast reveals that old histones move along genes from 3′\n                    toward 5′ over time, and that maternal histones move up to around 400 bp\n                    during genomic replication.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nIn addition to the information encoded in DNA sequence, replicating cells can inherit\n                epigenetic information, which refers to variable phenotypes that are heritable\n                without an underlying change in DNA sequence. It is widely accepted that chromatin,\n                the nucleoprotein packaging state of eukaryotic genomes, provides one potential\n                carrier of epigenetic information. Although definitive proof that chromatin per se\n                carries epigenetic information during replication exists in very few cases [1], genetic\n                studies in numerous organisms have identified key roles for chromatin regulators in\n                multiple epigenetic inheritance paradigms [2],[3].\n\nThe idea that chromatin structure carries epigenetic information poses a central\n                mechanistic question—since chromosome replication involves dramatic\n                perturbations to chromatin structure ranging from old histone displacement to\n                widespread incorporation of newly synthesized histones, how can chromatin states be\n                stably maintained? To understand the mechanism by which chromatin states could be\n                inherited, it is necessary to understand the unique challenges posed by histone\n                protein dynamics during replication [4]–[7]. First, histones must at least\n                transiently dissociate from the genome during passage of the replication\n                fork—if old histones carrying epigenetic information do not re-associate with\n                daughter genomes at the location from which they came, this could lead to\n                “epimutation,” analogous to DNA bases moving relative to one another\n                during genomic replication. Second, it is unknown to what extent newly synthesized\n                histones deposited at different loci differ in their covalent modification patterns.\n                Finally, how old histones influence new histones, the basis for positive feedback,\n                can be considered analogous to asking what the equivalent of base-pairing is during\n                chromatin replication.\n\nClassic radioactive pulse-chase studies demonstrated that, in bulk, maternal histones\n                segregate equally to the two daughter cells [4],[8]–[10]. It is unknown, however,\n                whether maternal histones remain close to the locus from which they were evicted by\n                the replication fork or whether maternal histones are incorporated at preferred\n                genomic loci in the two daughter genomes [5],[7],[11]. The extent of maternal histone\n                dispersal affects the stability of epigenetic states in theoretical models of\n                chromatin inheritance [12], making experimental determination of this parameter a\n                key goal for epigenetics research.\n\nTo address these fundamental questions, we carried out a genetic pulse-chase with\n                epitope-tagged histone H3 [13] to follow ancestral H3 for several cell divisions after\n                removal of the ancestral tag. We find that old histone proteins do not accumulate at\n                epigenetically regulated loci such as the subtelomeres but instead accumulate at the\n                5′ ends of long, poorly transcribed genes. As expected, old histones do not\n                accumulate at loci exhibiting rapid histone turnover, but we also find that 3′\n                to 5′ movement of old histones along coding regions and histone movement\n                during replication are required to explain the patterns of ancestral histone\n                retention we observe. We estimate that maternal histones stay within ∼400 bp of\n                their original location during replication, providing the first measure of this\n                crucial parameter. Finally, we identify a number of factors that affect old histone\n                localization, such as topoisomerase I and the H4 N-terminal tail, which both affect\n                the 5′ bias in localization patterns. In contrast, CAF-1 mostly affects\n                histone turnover at promoters. Together, these results provide a detailed overview\n                of the movement of ancestral histones across multiple cell generations and identify\n                a number of mechanisms that play a role in shaping the landscape of ancestral\n                histone retention.\n\n      Results\n      \nTo follow the movement of old histone proteins over multiple cell generations, we\n                utilized a novel pulse-chase technique [13] to follow ancestral\n                epitope-tagged histone H3 for several cell divisions after swapping epitope tags\n                from H3-HA to H3-T7 (Figure 1A,\n                    B). We have previously described use of this technique to assay\n                replication-independent H3 turnover in arrested cells and have shown that prior to\n                recombination all cells carry the H3-HA, and that recombination is 98%\n                efficient in cells that are not dividing due to nutrient deprivation (Figure S1).\n                Unlike inducible pGAL-based systems for measuring\n                replication-independent histone dynamics [14]–[17], here the epitope-tagged\n                histone is under the control of its endogenous promoter, avoiding potential\n                artifacts of H3/H4 misexpression [18] on histone dynamics throughout the cell cycle.\n\nWe used MNase-ChIP [15],[19] for the HA and T7 tags after recombination but before\n                release into the cell cycle, and 3 and 6 generations after releasing yeast into the\n                cell cycle [13]. This material was hybridized to tiling microarrays\n                covering 4% of the yeast genome [20], and HA/T7 ratios of normalized\n                HA and T7 signals were computed for the 3 and 6 generation data (Figure 1C, D). Since HA is\n                eliminated via recombination leaving new H3-T7, high HA/T7 ratios indicate loci\n                enriched for ancestral histone H3. Surprisingly, many of the highest HA/T7 levels\n                were associated with coding regions (discussed below).\n\nOverall, HA/T7 patterns are consistent at 3 and 6 generations, but the dynamic range\n                of HA/T7 enrichment diminished from 3 to 6 generations (Figure 1D, Figure S2).\n                This is an expected consequence of the fact that ∼1%–2% of\n                cells do not recombine the HA tag away (Figure S1)—since the amount of ancestral H3\n                is decreasing by at least 2-fold in each generation, the relative contribution of\n                the ∼2% of cells still expressing H3-HA will increase over time, with\n                this genomic background eventually competing with the real signal from increasingly\n                rare ancestral H3 (&lt;2% of total H3 after 6 doublings).\n\n        Ancestral Histones Are Retained Over Long, Poorly Transcribed Genes\n        \nTo extend our analyses to the entire genome, we carried out deep sequencing of HA\n                    and T7 libraries. HA- and T7-tagged H3 were immunoprecipitated after the tag\n                    swap but before release from arrest (0 generations), after release into a G2/M\n                    cell cycle block, and at 1, 3, and 6 generations after release. Sequencing reads\n                    were mapped to the yeast genome, normalized for read count, and HA/T7 ratios\n                    were computed genome-wide. These data correlated well with our microarray data,\n                    and we further validated these measurements by q-PCR at SPA2\n                    and BUD3, two genes which both exhibit high and low HA/T7\n                    ratios at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (Figure\n                    S3).\n\nIn previous work, we and others [13],[15]–[17],[21]–[23] showed that\n                    there is a partial correlation between transcription levels and\n                    replication-independent histone dynamics. To understand how transcription might\n                    affect multigenerational histone retention in our system, we aligned all yeast\n                    genes by their transcription start site (TSS) and clustered genes (K-means,\n                    K = 5) based on the pattern of the 3-generation HA/T7\n                    ratios along the gene body (Figures S4, S5, Table S1).\n                    We observed a striking enrichment of H3-HA just downstream of the 5′ ends\n                    of genes (typically peaking around the +3 nucleosome). One exception to the\n                    5′ pattern described is found in one cluster of short genes with uniformly\n                    low H3-HA levels (Figure S4, Cluster 1), which is enriched for\n                    GO categories (such as protein translation) related to high gene expression\n                    levels. In contrast, long genes were generally associated with higher levels of\n                    ancestral H3 (see for example Cluster 5).\n\nTo better visualize these trends, we sorted genes by the extent of ancestral H3\n                    retention after 3 generations (Figure 2A–B). Retention of ancestral histones correlates both\n                    with low expression levels and with longer genes (Figure 2C–D, Figure S6).\n                    While it is the case that longer genes tend to be expressed at lower levels than\n                    short genes (Figure 2E),\n                    these factors are partially independent here—even when we focus on genes\n                    of 1–2 kb length, we still observe the correlations between ancestral\n                    histone retention and low expression (Figure 2E–F, and see below).\n                    Interestingly, in both microarray and sequencing datasets we found that\n                    epigenetically repressed loci such as the silent mating loci and subtelomeres\n                        [24],[25] did not preferentially accumulate ancestral histone\n                    proteins (Figure 1C, Figure\n                    S7)—analysis of both unique and repetitive subtelomeric genes\n                    showed similar H3-HA retention patterns to euchromatic genes of similar length\n                    and expression. This was not a consequence of silencing defects in our strains,\n                    as they showed efficient mating (unpublished data).\n\nWhat properties of short or highly transcribed genes might lead to loss of\n                    ancestral histones? Replication-independent histone replacement occurs most\n                    rapidly over intergenic regions and over the coding regions of highly\n                    transcribed genes [15],[17],[21],[23], the converse of the pattern of ancestral H3\n                    retention we observe. Indeed, ancestral histone retention is broadly correlated\n                    with “cold” regions of low H3/H4 turnover (Figure 3A). Importantly, however, for a given\n                    level of H3/H4 turnover, ancestral H3 retention varied\n                    significantly—retention at a given nucleosome was better correlated with\n                    the average turnover rate of several surrounding nucleosomes than with the\n                    immediate turnover rate (see, for example, Figure 3B–C). This observation suggests\n                    that maternal histones preferentially re-associate with daughter genomes near\n                    the location from which they originated—if old histones scattered randomly\n                    at replication, ancestral H3 retention patterns should more precisely\n                    anticorrelate with replication-independent turnover patterns, as is discussed in\n                    more detail below.\n\n        Accumulation of Ancestral Histones at 5′ Ends of Genes\n        \nWhy do old histone proteins accumulate near the 5′ ends of genes? We\n                    considered two alternative possibilities for classes of mechanisms causing this\n                    pattern. In the first mechanism, we reason that if histone proteins tend to\n                    maintain their locations along the genome, the 5′ enrichment of old\n                    histones implies that old 3′ histones are evicted and replaced by new\n                    histones during some phase of the cell cycle. However, previous measures of\n                    turnover in G1- or G2/M-arrested yeast [15],[26] cannot explain the\n                    5′/3′ ratios we observe. Furthermore, we found that mutations in\n                    candidate 5′/3′-marking complexes such as cohesin [27],[28] or\n                    H3K4/K36 methylases [29] did not affect 5′-biased retention of old\n                    histones at target loci (Figure S8A).\n\nA second possible explanation for widespread 5′ accumulation of ancestral\n                    histone proteins is that the histone proteins move from 3′ to 5′\n                    over genes over time. This could result from RNA polymerase passage, because\n                    some RNA polymerases pass histone octamers in a retrograde direction during\n                    transcription [30],[31]. Although it is debatable whether this is true of\n                    Pol2 in vitro [32],[33], in vivo we previously observed that inactivation of\n                    Pol2 leads to a modest shift of nucleosomes from 5′ to 3′ [34], consistent\n                    with the idea that Pol2 movement normally shifts nucleosomes in a 5′\n                    direction. To test whether this movement was related to transcription, we asked\n                    whether the 5′ peak of H3-HA accumulation shifted further 5′ with\n                    increasing transcription rate. We normalized all gene lengths to one, then\n                    plotted the HA/T7 ratio for all genes sorted by transcription rate (Figure S9).\n                    Consistent with the prediction of transcription-dependent retrograde movement,\n                    we did observe a subtle signal of H3-HA peaks shifting further 5′ at\n                    higher transcription rates. While this analysis could be confounded by the\n                    higher transcription rates seen over shorter genes, even when we focus on\n                    1–2 kb genes, we observe that poorly transcribed genes exhibit a much\n                    flatter profile than genes expressed at average levels (Figure 2F), as expected if Pol2 transit were\n                    required for H3/H4 “passback.” Finally, we show below that per-gene\n                    estimates of passback exhibit significant correlation with Pol2 levels.\n                    Together, these results are most consistent with a model in which histone\n                    proteins move from 3′ to 5′ over coding regions over time (further\n                    detailed in the Discussion).\n\n        Quantitative Estimation of Nucleosome Dynamics During Replication\n        \nA key question we sought to address in this study is whether maternal histones\n                    re-associate near their original positions after passage of the replication\n                    fork. We reasoned that changes in HA/T7 patterns over the course of several\n                    generations might provide insight into the effects of replication on nucleosome\n                    dynamics. HA/T7 patterns change dramatically between arrest and 1 generation of\n                    release (with or without G2/M arrest) and then are very similar between 1 and 3\n                    generations, before the background of nonswitching cells starts to dominate the\n                    profile at 6 generations (Figure\n                        4). As expected, HA/T7 data at generation 0 exhibited widespread HA\n                    loss/T7 gain at promoters and +1 nucleosomes as a result of the rapid\n                    replication-independent turnover at these loci [13],[15],[17].\n                    Importantly, to rule out the possibility that 5′ accumulation of H3-HA was\n                    an effect of our arrest-release protocol, we also measured HA/T7 distributions 6\n                    h after inducing recombination in actively growing midlog cultures of yeast\n                        (Figures\n                        S3 and S10). Despite heterogeneity in switching\n                    times in this protocol (only 65% of yeast have switched from HA to T7 3 h\n                    after switch induction, 85% after 6 h), we nonetheless observed that\n                    HA/T7 distributions were remarkably similar in midlog-switching cells to HA/T7\n                    patterns observed in cells undergoing the arrest/release protocol, with\n                    preferential ancestral histone accumulation at the 5′ ends of long, poorly\n                    transcribed genes.\n\nWe asked whether these dynamic observations could be used to quantitatively rule\n                    out specific models concerning the mechanisms for segregation of maternal\n                    histones to daughter genomes. However, the resolution of this question is\n                    complicated by replication-independent processes we discuss above that can\n                    remove or shift ancestral histones, and that cannot be fully removed\n                    experimentally (for example, yeast will not proceed through the cell cycle in\n                    the absence of RNA polymerase). To understand the relationship between these\n                    issues, we designed an analytical model that accounts for three processes that\n                    affect H3 molecules in coding sequences (Figure 5A) and then examined the effect of\n                    removing any of the three. Briefly, our model includes a nucleosome-specific\n                    term for H3 turnover taken from prior experimental results [15], with H3 turnover resulting\n                    in loss of HA. In addition, it includes a gene-specific parameter accounting for\n                    lateral movement of histones (“passback”). Further, the model also\n                    includes a global parameter that describes the extent of histone\n                    “spreading” via dissociation/re-association during replication.\n                    Finally, the experimentally measured background of 2% nonswitching cells\n                        (Figure\n                        S1) was included. The free parameters of the model (describing global\n                    histone spreading and gene-specific lateral movement per generation) were\n                    estimated to maximize the likelihood of experimental observations (Text\n                    S1).\n\nTo account for any first-pass effects of Pol2 behavior during initial re-feeding\n                    of nutrient-depleted yeast (Figures S3 and S10), we\n                    examined this model with two starting conditions—the first started with a\n                    uniform genomic distribution of H3-HA, while the second started with the\n                    experimental distribution of HA/T7 observed after release into G2/M arrest\n                        (Figure 4). Both model\n                    variants predicted HA/T7 ratios with good correlations to the experimental data\n                        (Figure 5B shows data\n                    starting from a uniform distribution, Figure 5E and Figure S11\n                    start from the G2/M distribution). Examination of estimated parameters revealed\n                    expected behaviors. For instance, the distribution of lateral histone movement\n                    estimates (Figure 5C) was\n                    strongly biased towards retrograde 3′ to 5′ movement of histones,\n                    consistent with the previously measured effects of rpb1-1\n                    inactivation on nucleosome positioning [34]. Passback values were also\n                    significantly (p = 9.6439e-19) correlated\n                    with transcription rate (Figure S12).\n\nOur model allows us to estimate the extent of histone movement during\n                    replication. Figure 5D shows\n                    the likelihood of the full model plotted for various values for\n                    replication-dependent histone spreading. The best fit model allowed histones to\n                    spread ∼400 bp in either direction, or roughly two nucleosome widths, during\n                    replication (more precisely, in this model two-thirds of histones stay within\n                    400 bp of their original locations, as this value is the standard deviation of a\n                    Gaussian function describing spreading; see Text S1).\n                    Results from models with 800 and 1,600 bp spreading parameters are shown in\n                        Figure 6 for comparison.\n                    Our estimate of ±400 bp spreading is particularly interesting given\n                    electron microscopy results demonstrating that nucleosomes are destabilized over\n                    650–1,100 bp around the replication fork on replicating SV40\n                    minichromosomes [35],[36].\n\nElimination of any one or two of the three components of the\n                    model—spreading, turnover, or passback—resulted in significantly\n                    worse fits between model predictions and experimental data (Figure 5E). This can be intuited as follows.\n                    First, in the absence of histone spreading, unmitigated histone movement from\n                    3′ to 5′ results in a much tighter 5′ ancestral histone peak\n                    and results in much more extensive change from one generation to the next than\n                    we observe. Second, eliminating histone turnover shifts the 5′ ancestral\n                    peak closer to the +1/+2 nucleosome. Third, preventing lateral histone\n                    movement results in a 3′-shifted, flatter ancestral histone profile.\n\nWhile our model provided good quantitative fits of ancestral H3 patterns for many\n                    genes, we nonetheless note that many genes were not perfectly fit by this model.\n                    Generally, we found that the model poorly fit short genes, and overall the model\n                    almost universally predicted lower HA/T7 at the +N nucleosome (the last\n                    nucleosome in a gene) than was observed (Figures S11, S13). We\n                    ascribe these failures to the fact that we considered each gene in isolation and\n                    therefore did not model shifts of old nucleosomes from adjacent genes, which\n                    would result in poor fits over short genes in particular. Interestingly, the\n                    better fit at the +1 nucleosome than at the +N nucleosome is\n                    consistent with rapid promoter turnover more effectively isolating genes from\n                    one another at their 5′ ends in vivo.\n\nOverall, the strong correlation between our model and the experimental data\n                    supports the hypothesis that at least three dynamic processes affect nucleosomes\n                    and shape the landscape of ancestral histone retention and provide the first\n                    quantitative estimate of maternal histone dynamics during replication.\n\n        Topoisomerase I and the H4 N-Terminal Tail Play Roles in Establishing the\n                    5′/3′ Gradient of Ancestral H3 Molecules\n        \nTo further investigate the mechanism of 5′ accumulation, we asked whether\n                    gene-specific passback parameters were correlated with specific gene annotations\n                        (Table\n                        S2) [34],[37]. Interestingly, we find that the estimated passback\n                    distance was much greater at TFIID-dominated (“growth”) genes than\n                    at SAGA-dominated (“stress”) genes (Figure 7A) [38]. As a result, 5′\n                    accumulation was much more pronounced at TFIID-dominated than at SAGA-dominated\n                    genes (Figure 7B). Almost\n                    every described aspect of chromatin structure and gene expression, from\n                    nucleosome positioning to evolutionary lability (reviewed in [39],[40],[41]), differs\n                    between these two broad types of genes. Mechanistically, one interesting\n                    correlate is that TFIID recruitment has been proposed to be mediated in part by\n                    acetylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H4 [38],[42].\n\nTo investigate this link experimentally, we examined whether mutations of the H4\n                    tail influenced ancestral histone H3 retention. In an H4K5,12R mutant that\n                    cannot be acetylated on these two tail residues, the 5′-biased HA/T7 was\n                    partially lost (Figure S8B), consistent with the possibility that acetylation of H4\n                    tail lysines may contribute to H3/H4 passback. We also deleted the H4 N-terminal\n                    tail, although in this strain background this mutation proved lethal and so all\n                    recovered strains retained a wild-type copy of the H4-H3 locus\n                        (HHF2-HHT2). Thus, results with this strain must be\n                    interpreted with extreme caution, as we do not know the effect of wild-type,\n                    untagged nucleosomes on the behavior of the epitope-tagged histones.\n\nNonetheless we present here results of mapping of HA and T7 3 generations after\n                    release from the HA/T7 tag swap, since the H4 tail deletion has dramatic effects\n                    on global nucleosome dynamics (Figure 7C), with low HA/T7 at 5′ ends followed by a nearly\n                    flat profile over the remainder of coding regions. This profile suggests a\n                    requirement for the H4 tail in H3/H4 passback, and possibly on\n                    replication-mediated spreading (see Figure 5E). Interestingly, the effect of H4 tail deletion was much\n                    more pronounced at TFIID-dominated genes (Figure 7D), suggesting that the exaggerated\n                    H3/H4 passback inferred at these genes involves the H4 tail. The effects of the\n                    H4 tail deletion were not simply due to the extensive changes in the\n                    transcriptome [43], as we measured changes in genome-wide RNA Pol2\n                    localization in our H4 mutant strains, finding that the relationship between\n                    Pol2 levels and HA/T7 behavior qualitatively changed in this mutant (Figure\n                    S14). While we must be cautious interpreting results obtained with the H4\n                    tail deletion, the fact that H4K5,12R mutants (which were viable and did not\n                    retain any wild-type H3/H4) also exhibit diminished 5′ bias in ancestral\n                    H3 retention provides independent support for a key role for the H4 tail in\n                    H3/H4 passback.\n\nWe also explored the role of supercoiling in the 5′-biased retention of old\n                    histones. Topoisomerases relax DNA supercoiling and thereby help to maintain\n                    chromatin architecture. Transcription of DNA templates by Pol2 differentially\n                    affects supercoiling in front of and behind the passing polymerase, thereby\n                    differentially affecting 5′ and 3′ nucleosomes [44],[45]. To assess the role of this\n                    activity in 5′ accumulation of old histones, we examined the consequences\n                    of inactivation of the major topoisomerase Top1, which in vitro can resolve both\n                    negative and positive supercoils [46],[47]. Cells\n                    lacking Top1 showed reduced 5′ bias in ancestral nucleosome accumulation\n                        (Figure 7E), indicating\n                    that resolving DNA topology problems before or after passage of the\n                    transcription or replication machinery influences the mobility and/or stability\n                    of nucleosomes. Consistent with expectations of a greater buildup of supercoils\n                    over longer transcription units, we confirmed a stronger effect of\n                        TOP1 deletion at longer genes (Figure 7F).\n\n        Replication Timing, Chaperones, and Ancestral Histone Retention\n        \nWe finally turn to the role of replication factors in ancestral histone\n                    retention. We first asked whether replication timing affected H3-HA retention.\n                    Nucleosomes surrounding early-firing origins tended to lose H3-HA more rapidly\n                    than late-firing origins (unpublished data), but this likely stems from the fact\n                    that replication timing correlates with replication-independent turnover [23],[26]. Focusing\n                    only on nearby coding regions (Figure S15), we found that late-replicating\n                    genes were associated with slightly 5′ shifted ancestral H3 peaks relative\n                    to genes near early origins (consistent with decreased spreading or turnover),\n                    suggesting that different replication forks might affect chromatin in different\n                    ways, although the modest effect precludes a stronger interpretation.\n\nTo directly address the role of fork-associated chromatin proteins in histone\n                    spreading at replication, we examined mutations of PCNA and Chromatin Assembly\n                    Factor (CAF-1), which plays a key role in replication-coupled histone deposition\n                        [48],[49]. Three different mutants of PCNA that disrupt\n                    interactions with replication proteins or with replication-coupled\n                    chromatin-assembly factors showed only minor effects on 5′ retention of\n                    ancestral H3 at target genes SPA2 and BUD3\n                        (Figure\n                        S8C). In contrast, ancestral H3 retention at the 5′ ends of\n                    these target genes was slightly increased upon deletion of the\n                    CAF-1 subunit CAC1 (unpublished data). To further explore the\n                    role of CAF-1 in histone retention patterns, we deep sequenced HA and T7 tags\n                    from cac1Δ yeast 3 generations after release (Figure 8). These data show a\n                    dramatic 5′ shift in the peak of ancestral H3 retention in these mutants.\n                    This shift is most consistent with a decrease in histone turnover at the\n                    5′ ends of genes in this mutant, which we have independently confirmed\n                    using G1-arrested yeast expressing pGAL-driven Flag-H3 [50].\n                    However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the role of CAF-1 in retention\n                    of old histones in 5′ and promoter regions involves interactions with PCNA\n                    during DNA replication. Interestingly, the 5′ accumulation observed in\n                    wild-type yeast is otherwise little changed in the CAF-1 mutant over long genes\n                        (Figure\n                        S16), suggesting that 3′ to 5′ movement of histones is\n                    normal, and that preferential retention of old histones at their maternal\n                    locations may be carried out by alternative histone chaperones such as the Hir\n                    complex or Asf1 in this mutant. Unfortunately, both hir and\n                        asf1 mutants are lethal in our strain background (likely\n                    because our strain carries only one copy of the H3/H4 gene pair [51]), preventing\n                    us from testing this hypothesis.\n\n        Consequences for Histone Modification Patterns\n        \nOur results are most consistent with histone retrogression from 3′ to\n                    5′ over genes, which raises the question of whether old histones carry\n                    modifications associated with mid- and 3′ coding regions (e.g., H3K36 and\n                    H3K79 methylation) towards the 5′ end of genes. Alternatively, there could\n                    be active erasure of these modifications. We therefore compared genes exhibiting\n                    high levels of ancestral H3 retention with prior genome-wide analyses of histone\n                    modifications [52],[53]. Histone modification patterns generally conformed to\n                    the patterns expected based on transcriptional behavior—genes that retain\n                    high levels of ancestral histones are poorly transcribed (Figure 2D), and correspondingly exhibit low\n                    levels of transcription-related marks H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac, and H3K4\n                    methylation (Figure S17 and unpublished data). However, these are all\n                    5′-biased marks [19],[29],[52],[54], and based on retrograde movement of old histones are\n                    therefore not expected to accumulate with age.\n\nMore interestingly, we found that genes with high levels of old nucleosomes were\n                    enriched for H3K79me3 throughout their coding regions, particularly at the\n                    5′ end (Figure 9,\n                        Figure\n                        S17). The H3K79 methylase is nonprocessive, indicating that K79\n                    methylation status should essentially act as a timer [55]. Further, analyses of\n                    genome-wide H3K79me3 patterns show anticorrelation between this modification and\n                    locations of high nucleosome turnover [15],[56], supporting the idea that\n                    K79me3 identifies old H3 protein. We recently confirmed that old H3 protein is\n                    enriched for H3K79me3 by mass spec analysis of old nucleosomes (D. DeVos, FvL et\n                    al., submitted).\n\nFinally, we also observed higher levels of H3K36me3 at 5′ and mid-CDS of\n                    genes exhibiting elevated ancestral histone retention relative to genes with\n                    intermediate H3-HA retention (Figure S17). This observation is consistent\n                    with the above hypotheses that old histones move from 3′ to 5′ and\n                    thus might carry typical mid-CDS and 3′-end histone modifications to the\n                    5′ ends of genes (Figure S18). Together, these results provide\n                    further evidence that our system accurately captures the behavior of old\n                    histones.\n\n      Discussion\n      \nThe fate of stable proteins in rapidly dividing cells is of great interest for fields\n                from protein damage to aging to epigenetic inheritance. In particular, models for\n                the inheritance of chromatin-based information [5]–[7],[12],[57],[58] require a quantitative\n                understanding of the fate of specific maternal histone proteins during the\n                disruptive replication process. Some models for epigenetic inheritance of chromatin\n                states require that old nucleosomes are retained near their original positions,\n                whereas other models (such as those based on replication timing; [59]) are less\n                sensitive to the fates of old histones. However, due to the lack of methods to\n                directly track histone dispersal during replication, these models have not been\n                experimentally tested in vivo. Here, by using a novel genetic pulse-chase assay, we\n                characterize ancestral histone retention patterns across the yeast genome. By\n                accounting for known replication-independent processes, we used these data to\n                estimate the effects of replication on histone movement, finding that H3/H4 are\n                retained close to their original locations during replication. We also identified a\n                number of mutants that affect various aspects of ancestral H3/H4 movement and\n                retention.\n\n        Ancestral Histones Accumulate at the 5′ Ends of Genes\n        \nMost surprising to us was the observation that ancestral H3 molecules accumulate\n                    near the 5′ ends of coding regions, peaking around the +3 nucleosome.\n                    The high HA/T7 ratio observed at the 5′ ends of genes is not an artifact\n                    of the epitope tags used, as we have observed the converse behavior (high T7/HA)\n                    when we switch the epitope tags used (unpublished data). Furthermore, this\n                    unusual behavior is not an artifact of the conditions used for growth arrest and\n                    release, as we observe a similar 5′/3′ gradient of H3-HA when yeast\n                    are subjected to the epitope switch during active midlog growth (Figure\n                    S10).\n\nWhat is the mechanistic basis for the 5′/3′ gradient of HA/T7 we\n                    observe? We consider two classes of mechanisms—in one, histone proteins do\n                    not move laterally and the 5′/3′ gradient results from preferential\n                    loss of 3′ H3/H4, while in the other the gradient results from lateral\n                    histone movement combined with loss at the 5′ end. While we cannot\n                    definitively answer which mechanism explains our results, we strongly disfavor a\n                    model with preferential 3′ nucleosome eviction and no lateral movement\n                    based on the following observations. First, we tested a number of relevant\n                    mutants for changes in the 5′/3′ HA/T7 bias (Figure S8).\n                    Loss of H3K4 methylation (a 5′-biased histone mark) or H3K36 methylation\n                    (a mid and 3′-biased histone mark) did not affect HA/T7 patterns at\n                    selected target genes. Similarly, 5′ retention of ancestral H3 was\n                    unaffected by mutants of cohesin, whose loading is associated with regions of\n                    high H3/H4 turnover and which accumulates at the 3′ ends of genes [27],[28]. Second,\n                    direct measurements of H3/H4 turnover using a pGAL-driven\n                    epitope tagged H3 do not provide evidence for ubiquitous 3′ histone\n                    replacement during G1 arrest [15], during G2/M arrest [26], or in unsynchronized yeast\n                        [15]. Thus,\n                    while we cannot definitively rule out some cryptic 3′ replacement event in\n                    this system, all direct tests have failed to support this hypothesis.\n\nConversely, multiple observations support the hypothesis that H3/H4 proteins move\n                    from 3′ to 5′ over protein-coding regions over time. First, seminal\n                    in vitro studies on transcription of nucleosomal templates showed that several\n                    RNA polymerases can transcribe through a nucleosome without displacing the H3/H4\n                    tetramer. The proposed mechanism by which histones remain associated with the\n                    DNA is a “bubble propagation” mechanism—DNA partially unwraps\n                    from the histones, RNA polymerase enters, and DNA behind the polymerase\n                    re-associates with the histone octamer, resulting in a net retrograde movement\n                    of histones after the polymerase has passed. This mechanism is relatively well\n                    established for SP6 polymerase and RNA Polymerase III [30],[31], whereas there is some\n                    controversy regarding the effect of RNA Polymerase II on nucleosome positioning\n                        [32],[33]. Of course, it is not unreasonable to expect that\n                    nucleosome movement during transcription in vivo will also be affected by\n                    polymerase-associated factors such as histone chaperones and ATP-dependent\n                    remodelers that are not present in the in vitro systems. In any case, these\n                    studies provide a plausible mechanism by which RNA polymerase transit results in\n                    retrograde nucleosome movement.\n\nSecond, we have previously found that inactivation of Pol2 using the\n                    temperature-sensitive rpb1-1 allele results in a net 5′\n                    to 3′ shift in the majority of coding region nucleosomes [34], consistent\n                    with the hypothesis that polymerase transit normally shuttles nucleosomes from\n                    3′ to 5′. Third, highly transcribed genes (such as those encoding\n                    ribosomal proteins) in yeast paradoxically exhibit very tightly spaced coding\n                    region nucleosomes (e.g., 155–160 bp between adjacent nucleosomes rather\n                    than ∼165 bp), and this tight spacing relaxes upon Pol2 inactivation, again\n                    consistent with nucleosomes being passed upstream during transcription [34]. Taken\n                    together with the absence of any evidence for 3′ H3/H4 eviction, we\n                    therefore argue that the most parsimonious explanation of the surprising\n                    5′ accumulation of ancestral histones is retrograde movement of histones\n                    over genes against the direction of transcription. Note that while we favor the\n                    hypothesis that the act of RNA polymerase transit itself is the mechanism\n                    linking transcription to H3/H4 passback, polymerase is not the only candidate\n                    factor leading to retrograde histone movement. Notably, we found that\n                        top1Δ mutants exhibit diminished signatures of H3/H4\n                    passback (Figure 7), and\n                    this decrease was stronger at longer genes, suggesting the possibility that some\n                    aspect of cleavage and rotation of twisted DNA by Top1 contributes to the\n                    passback observed. However, it is also possible that Top1 differentially affects\n                    histone turnover in 5′ and 3′ regions or affects passback by\n                    affecting Pol2 passage [60].\n\nWe analytically assess several predictions of the “passback” model.\n                    First of all, if RNA polymerase transit were the driver of retrograde histone\n                    movement, then one might predict that passback should correlate with\n                    transcription rate. We find the expected correlation to be statistically\n                    significant (p = 9.6439e-19, Figure S12)\n                    but weak nonetheless (R = 0.12). Importantly, we previously\n                    observed that 5′ to 3′ nucleosome movement in\n                        rpb1-1 mutants was also significantly but poorly correlated\n                    with transcription rate [34]. The reason for the mediocre correlation between\n                    polymerase abundance and passback is hinted at by the fact that TFIID-dominated\n                    genes exhibit much greater passback values than do SAGA-dominated genes (Figure 7A). We have previously\n                    noted that SAGA-dominated (“stress”) genes exhibit higher levels of\n                    H3 turnover, per polymerase, than do TFIID-dominated genes\n                        [15]. In\n                    vitro, a single polymerase's transit displaces an H2A/H2B dimer from the\n                    histone octamer, but a second polymerase encountering a histone hexamer will\n                    displace the remaining histones [61],[62]. Coupled with the\n                    observation that SAGA-dominated genes exhibit larger “bursts” of\n                    polymerase, this suggests that closely spaced polymerases are required for H3/H4\n                    eviction over coding regions, but evenly spaced polymerases leave time for dimer\n                    replacement on damaged nucleosomes [54],[62]. We believe this model\n                    also explains some of the behavior of ancestral histones in this\n                    study—SAGA-dominated genes display little passback and overall diminished\n                    levels of ancestral H3 (Figure\n                        7A–B), an expected consequence of the loss of old histones via\n                    turnover. Correlations between polymerase and passback are therefore expected to\n                    be subtle—at increasing transcription rates, we expect an increased\n                    likelihood of a closely spaced pair of polymerases, and the resulting H3/H4\n                    eviction would eliminate any trace of the passback that had occurred to that\n                    point.\n\nIt is important to note that the transcription-dependent passback postulated here\n                    cannot simply be interpreted as a model in which every round of polymerase\n                    passage shifts the histone octamer upstream by one position (∼165 bp). In\n                        Figure 7A, our estimates\n                    of passback per cell cycle have a mean of ∼90 bp at TFIID-dominated genes,\n                    less than the spacing between adjacent nucleosomes. If taken literally, these\n                    values would be difficult to reconcile with the observation that the majority of\n                    yeast nucleosomes are well positioned [20]. Instead, we interpret the\n                    passback values in terms of probability that an octamer will be passed back in a\n                    given cell cycle in each cell—a passback value of ∼80 bp suggests that\n                    there is a 50% chance that histones on a given gene will be shifted back\n                    one position towards the 5′ end in a single cell cycle. Physically, we\n                    imagine that polymerase passage results in relatively short retrograde movement\n                    of H3/H4, which then have some probability of returning to their original\n                    position, and some probability of shifting to a new upstream location.\n\nOur results show a surprising pattern of ancestral histone retention in yeast,\n                    with old histone proteins accumulating near the 5′ ends of genes—the\n                    histone proteins located at the +3 nucleosome are the oldest histone\n                    proteins over a typical yeast gene. These data are best explained by a model in\n                    which H3/H4 proteins shuttle from 3′ to 5′ over coding regions over\n                    time, with eventual loss of old histone proteins when they are eventually moved\n                    into the +1 and +2 nucleosome positions.\n\n        Maternal Histone Spreading During Replication\n        \nThe process of genomic replication is enormously disruptive to chromatin\n                    structure, as the melting of the DNA double helix is accompanied by histone\n                    dissociation from the genome [4]–[7]. Thus,\n                    understanding where maternal histones re-associate relative to the locus from\n                    which they were evicted is a key constraint for understanding the potential of\n                    chromatin as an epigenetic information carrier. The ideal experiment for\n                    measuring this would be to epitope tag the histones at one specific locus (e.g.,\n                    the +5 nucleosome over BUD3) in a large population of\n                    yeast, allow replication to proceed, and measure the new locations of the tagged\n                    histones. Despite numerous attempts, this type of tagging has proven technically\n                    intractable to date. Here we measure instead the bulk distribution of ancestral\n                    histones. Importantly, this still provides information on locus-specific histone\n                    behavior—as turnover rates are not homogeneous across the genome, even\n                    before we release yeast into the cell cycle the landscape of H3-HA exhibits\n                    variability (Figure 4, see\n                    generation 0), and so in effect only a subset of ancestral locations are\n                    epitope-tagged before release. This enables us to infer the dynamic behavior of\n                    histone proteins during replication via analysis of the evolution of the H3-HA\n                    distributions over time.\n\nTwo observations provide an intuition regarding the effects of replication on\n                    histone locations. First, ancestral histone retention exhibits the expected\n                    anticorrelation with replication-independent turnover (Figure 3A). However, old histones are more\n                    efficiently retained at cold (low turnover) loci that occur in long cold\n                    domains, whereas short domains of cold nucleosomes lose ancestral histones over\n                    time. This observation is inconsistent with two extreme models for histone\n                    behavior during replication—if old histones were to completely dissociate\n                    from the genome during replication and randomly re-associate with the genome,\n                    then ancestral histone retention should precisely recapitulate turnover\n                    measurements. Conversely, if old histones were to reassociate precisely with\n                    their original locations, then ancestral retention should essentially integrate\n                    turnover for multiple generations. Thus, some process that shuffles histone\n                    proteins locally must be invoked along with turnover to shape the ancestral\n                    retention landscape.\n\nIn principle, the preferential retention of old histones on longer genes could\n                    simply result from passback—shorter genes will more quickly have all of\n                    their histones passed “over a cliff” at the 5′ end. However,\n                    we find relatively static 5′/3′ gradients of old histone retention\n                    over time (Figure 4). While\n                    it is the case that H3-HA domains gradually shorten over time as predicted by\n                    the model that passback results in old histones being moved to promoters where\n                    they are replaced (unpublished data), this effect is subtle and is\n                    quantitatively much less dramatic than predicted from passback alone. This leads\n                    to the second intuition regarding histone spreading during replication. Many\n                    examples exist for relatively static gradients in biological systems being\n                    established via a combination of directional active transport coupled with\n                    passive diffusion. Most relevant in our opinion is the “pump leak”\n                    model [63]\n                    for membrane ion gradients—active transport of ions across membranes,\n                    coupled with a passive leak of ions back into the cell, results in a static\n                    gradient. Here, we envision transcription-related passback as the active\n                    transport mechanism, with spreading during replication being somewhat analogous\n                    to the leak that results in a steady gradient rather than a continuous 3′\n                    to 5′ march of histone proteins.\n\nWe present a quantitative model that recapitulates our experimental data with\n                    only three dynamic processes—turnover, passback, and spreading.\n                    Locus-specific turnover rates were previously measured [15] and are not fit by the model.\n                    Passback is estimated for each gene separately, while spreading is a single\n                    global parameter affecting all histones. Thus, our model has 4,811 free\n                    parameters, which are used to fit over 100,000 HA/T7 ratios. This model does not\n                    overfit the data, and this can best be appreciated by the fact that eliminating\n                    a single parameter (spreading) greatly diminishes the agreement between model\n                    and data.\n\nUsing this model, we estimate that maternal histones spread little\n                    (∼1–2 nucleosomes) during replication. This value has not been\n                    measured before but is consistent with several related observations. First,\n                    electron microscopy studies on replicating chromatin show a stretch of\n                    ∼650–1,100 bp of nucleosome-free DNA surrounding replication forks\n                        [35],[36], consistent\n                    with histone movement of ±400 bp we estimate here. Second, histone\n                    proteins are retained in cis during in vitro replication even in the presence of\n                    competitor DNA [64]–[67], indicating that histones do not freely diffuse away\n                    from replication forks but likely are retained locally. Finally, we previously\n                    observed that upon gene repression, loss of the active chromatin mark H3K4me3\n                    occurs during S phase, but at very highly methylated nucleosomes H3K4me3 does\n                    not return to baseline levels immediately, with methylation levels falling\n                    little more than the 2-fold predicted by a dilution-based mechanism (see Figure S5\n                    in [68]). This final result indicates that\n                    “overmethylated” old histone proteins are retained near their\n                    original location, since extensive spreading of old histone proteins would\n                    enable a greater than 2-fold drop in methylation levels during S phase.\n\nTogether, these results support the prospect of chromatin as a\n                    “sloppy” epigenetic information carrier (“sloppy” in the\n                    sense that some spreading of histones will preclude mononucleosome-resolution\n                    information passage) [69], even if chromatin-based inheritance occurs\n                    infrequently [1]. Thus, chromatin states are unlikely to be inherited\n                    with mononucleosome precision, a view consistent with the fact that most or all\n                    proposed epigenetic chromatin domains are associated with long (&gt;1 kb) blocks\n                    of histone modifications such as H3K9me3 or deacetylated H4K16 (reviewed in\n                        [54]).\n\n        Mutant Studies\n        \nTo further investigate the mechanisms underlying the patterns of ancestral H3\n                    retention, we assessed HA/T7 ratios at target genes in 12 mutants and further\n                    characterized HA/T7 genome wide for three of these mutants. Interestingly, a\n                    number of histone modifying factors, including Swd1, Swd3, Rtt109, Nhp6, and\n                    Set2, had either no effect or subtle effects (e.g., Rtt109) on the 5′\n                    accumulation of old histones at our target genes (Figure S8).\n                    These results suggest either that these mutants will have subtle global effects\n                    on ancestral H3 retention or that they have more localized roles that do not\n                    extend to the two target genes on which we focused.\n\nThe three mutants we characterized at full genome coverage each had a distinct\n                    effect on ancestral H3 retention. Most dramatically, loss of the H4 N-terminal\n                    tail abolished the 5′ accumulation of ancestral histones—while the\n                    H4 tail deletion results are complicated by the retention of wild-type H3/H4 in\n                    this strain, the fact that similar results were obtained with clean H4K5,12R\n                    mutants (Figure\n                        S8B) provides independent support for observations obtained with the\n                    H4 tail deletion. The mechanistic basis for the loss of 5′ H3-HA retention\n                    is unknown to us—a flat HA/T7 profile is of course consistent with\n                    complete loss of passback. Alternatively, the observed profile in this mutant\n                    could be consistent with complete shuffling of maternal histones every\n                    generation, which as described above would be expected to more closely\n                    recapitulate a turnover-dominated profile. Importantly, loss of the H4 tail also\n                    affects H3/H4 turnover—in Figure 7D, the increased HA/T7 ratio at the 5′ ends of\n                    SAGA-dominated genes suggests a decrease in histone turnover in this mutant, and\n                    we have independently confirmed a decrease in replication-independent turnover\n                    in this mutant (F.v.L., manuscript in preparation). Analysis of Pol2 ChIP in H4\n                    tail deletions shows that the effects of the H4 tail do not simply reflect\n                    altered transcription but instead reflect a change in the relationship between\n                    RNA Polymerase and histone dynamics over genes in this mutant (Figure\n                    S14).\n\nWe also observe a similar, albeit muted, effect of Topoisomerase I on the\n                    5′ accumulation of ancestral histones. Interestingly, loss of both\n                    topoisomerase I and II affects nucleosome occupancy and dynamics in S.\n                        pombe, indicating that topoisomerases play key roles in histone\n                    dynamics [60]. Here, we find that top1Δ\n                    mutants exhibit diminished 5′ accumulation of ancestral H3 and that this\n                    effect is stronger at longer genes than at shorter genes. As RNA polymerase\n                    passage will cause greater changes in supercoiling over longer genes, the\n                    preferential effects of Top1 on longer genes is consistent with the observation\n                    in S. pombe that topoisomerase mutants show evidence of stalled\n                    or slowed RNA polymerase over longer genes [60]. In addition to its\n                    role in transcription, topoisomerase I plays a key role in replication [45]. We note\n                    that the profile of top1Δ mutants here most closely mimics\n                    the predictions of our analytical model with both passback and spreading being\n                    compromised, but since neither of these is likely to be completely eliminated in\n                        top1Δ mutants, more detailed kinetic analyses will be\n                    required to make a quantitative statement about the role of Top1 in\n                    replication-related movement of histones.\n\nFinally, we assessed the role of the histone chaperone CAF-1 in ancestral H3\n                    retention. To our surprise, we found that H3-HA exhibited even stronger 5′\n                    accumulation in this mutant, with the 5′ peak of HA/T7 occurring closer to\n                    the +1 or +2 nucleosome (compared to the +3 peak location for\n                    wild-type strains). This result most closely matches the predictions of a model\n                    in which H3/H4 turnover has been slowed without loss of passback or spreading\n                        (Figure 5E). We recently\n                    tested this prediction using an alternative system for measuring\n                    replication-independent turnover (pGAL-driven Flag-H3) and\n                    confirmed the prediction that caf mutants affect\n                    replication-independent histone replacement [50]. As CAF-1 and the Hir\n                    complex are known to complement one another in yeast, we predict that a\n                        caf hir double mutant would be necessary to uncover effects\n                    of replication-coupled spreading. Unfortunately, since both hir\n                    and asf mutants are lethal in our strain background, this\n                    prediction cannot be tested at present.\n\n        Perspective\n        \nTaken together, our results provide a surprising view of histone dynamics over\n                    multiple generations, with 5′ accumulation of ancestral histone proteins\n                    over coding regions and little evidence for preferential histone retention at\n                    epigenetically regulated loci such as subtelomeric genes. One unanticipated\n                    implication of this observation is that 3′ histone marks are expected to\n                    move towards the 5′ ends of genes over time, thereby shaping histone\n                    modification profiles (as we document in Figure 9 and Figure\n                    S17). This potentially necessitates mechanisms for erasure of these\n                    inappropriate marks in order to maintain accurate encoding of gene polarity.\n                    However, we note that active erasure of H3K4me3 after gene repression occurs\n                    most efficiently at 5′ ends of genes, whereas nucleosomes over coding\n                    regions mostly lose H3K4me3 by passive dilution ([68], see Figure S9).\n                    If other old histone marks are not erased over coding regions, then we speculate\n                    that the accumulation of old histone proteins at the +3 nucleosome could\n                    potentially provide a mechanism by which a gene's transcriptional history\n                    could be integrated to play a role in regulation of the transition from\n                    transcriptional initiation to elongation.\n\nMost importantly, we find that old histones do not re-associate with daughter\n                    genomes at precisely the locus from which they dissociated. Thus, any\n                    inheritance of chromatin states must occur at the scale of ∼5–10\n                    nucleosome domains rather than at single nucleosome resolution. These results\n                    therefore constrain the maximum amount of information theoretically carried by\n                    chromatin between generations. It will be of great interest in future studies to\n                    identify mutants that affect histone movement during replication and to measure\n                    their effects on the stability of epigenetic inheritance and to measure how\n                    maternal histone incorporation differs between leading and lagging strand\n                    daughter genomes.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions\n        \nFor tag switch experiments, yeast cells were grown overnight in YPD in the\n                    presence of Hygromycin B (200 µg/mL, Invitrogen). The cells were then\n                    diluted 1∶10 into fresh YPD and incubated for 30–36 h. Recombination\n                    was induced by the addition of 1 µM β-estradiol (E-8875,\n                    Sigma-Aldrich). Subsequently, cells were diluted 1∶25 in fresh YPD media\n                    to release the cells back into the cell cycle and kept in log phase by 1∶2\n                    dilutions into fresh media after each population doubling. Samples were taken\n                    after 1, 2, 3, and 6 cell divisions or after 5 h of G2/M arrest. The number of\n                    population doublings was determined by microscopy and OD. G2/M arrest was\n                    induced by addition of 15 µg/ml Nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) and confirmed\n                    by FACS analysis. Strains are listed in Table S3. Gene deletion mutants isogenic to\n                    strains NKI2048, NKI2148, and NKI2048 were made by homologous recombination\n                    using KanMX and/or NatMX selection markers. Gene deletion mutants isogenic to\n                    NKI4128 were made by crossing NKI4114 with gene deletion mutants from the\n                        MATa yeast knock-out collection using Synthetic Genetic Array\n                    methods. Histone mutants were made by transformation of strain NKI2148 with a\n                        HHF2-HHT2 CEN plasmid (pMP9), subsequent deletion of the\n                    tagged HHF2-HHT2 locus, followed by transformation with a PCR\n                    fragment encoding wild-type or mutated HHF2 in combination with\n                    tagged HHT2. Deletion of the wild-type locus was confirmed in\n                    H4K5,12R mutants, whereas all surviving H4 tail deletion mutants retained a copy\n                    of the wild-type HHT2-HHF2 locus.\n\n        Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\n        \nChIP was performed as described previously [13],[70] with the\n                    following modifications. All steps were done at 4°C unless otherwise\n                    indicated. Following cell lysis by bead beating the insoluble chromatin of\n                        1×109 cells was washed, resuspended in 400 µl FA\n                    lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,\n                    1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), and sheared using a\n                    Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 6 min with 30 s intervals at high. The soluble\n                    fraction was diluted 3-fold in buffer 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM\n                        CaCl2, 5 mM β-meracptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl2, after\n                    which 25 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) were added. The digestion\n                    reaction was incubated 20 min at 37°C and stopped by the addition of 10 mM\n                    EDTA and 10 mM EGTA; tubes were placed on ice. The majority of obtained\n                    fragments was around 150 bp, as determined on a 2% TAE agarose gel\n                    stained with ethidium bromide. The isolated chromatin of the equivalent of\n                        3×108 cells was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C\n                    using magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen), which were previously incubated with\n                    antibody O/N at 4°C.\n\n        Real-Time PCR\n        \nChIP DNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR using the SYBR Green PCR\n                    Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI PRISM 7500. An input sample was used\n                    to make a standard curve, which was then used to calculate the IP samples, all\n                    performed in the 7500 fast system software. Primers used for qPCR are listed in\n                        Table\n                        S4.\n\n          Linear amplification of DNA\n          \nThe samples were amplified, with a starting amount of up to 75 ng for ChIP\n                        samples, using the DNA linear amplification method described previously\n                            [19].\n\n          Microarray hybridization\n          \n3 µg of aRNA produced from the linear amplification were used to label\n                        probe via the amino-allyl method as described on www.microarrays.org. Labeled probes were hybridized onto a\n                        yeast tiled oligonucleotide microarray [20] at 65°C for 16 h and\n                        washed as described on www.microarrays.org.\n                        The arrays were scanned at 5 micron resolution with an Axon Laboratories\n                        GenePix 4000B scanner running GenePix 5.1. Image analysis and data\n                        normalization were performed as previously described [19].\n\n        Deep Sequencing Library Construction\n        \nChIP DNA was treated with CIP (calf alkaline phosphatase NEB; in 1× NEB\n                    buffer 3, 0.25 U/µl CIP; 45 min at 37°C, reaction clean up with Qiagen\n                    MinElute spin columns). 20–150 ng of CIP treated ChIP DNA fragments were\n                    blunt ended and phosphorylated with the EPICENTRE End-it-Repair kit (1×\n                    buffer, 0.25 mM dNTPs,1 mM ATP, 1 µl/50 µl reaction of Enzyme mix)\n                    for 1 h at RT and cleaned up with Qiagen MinElute spin columns.

The arrays were scanned with the Agilent microarray\n                    scanner.\n\n          Data availability\n          \nData are downloadable at http://www.umassmed.edu/bmp/faculty/rando.cfm and have been\n                        deposited in GEO (Accession # GSE28269).\n\n          Analysis\n          \nRaw sequencing data of HA and T7 libraries after the tag swap before release\n                        from arrest (0 generations), and at 1, 3, and 6 generations after release\n                        were uniquely mapped to the S. cerevisiae genome.\n                        Nucleosome positions were called from aggregated HA and T7 sequencing of the\n                        3 generation sample using Template-Filtering [34]. For each nucleosome,\n                        we counted the number of supporting reads for each sample separately and\n                        calculated the ratio of HA reads to T7 reads at each nucleosome for each\n                        time point. Note, for the H4tailΔ data the T7 data quality was poor, so\n                        we used wild-type T7 sequences for this comparison.\n\nFor aggregated analyses such as those shown in Figure 2E or Figure 3, we calculated the median of the\n                        Log2 HA/T7 over the 1 kb starting at a given gene's transcription start\n                        site to provide a summary retention score per gene.\n\n          Model\n          \nDescribed in Text S1.\n\n      Supporting Information"
