  "abstract": "Neurons, glia, and callosal axons operate as a “ménage à trois” in the development of the corpus callosum.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nThe largest commissural tract in the human brain is the corpus callosum (CC), with over 200 million axons that act as a conduit for information between the two cerebral hemispheres. Callosally projecting neurons are Satb2-positive pyramidal projection neurons positioned, in rodents, in upper and lower cortical layers and that extend their axons through the CC [1]–[4]. More than 50 human syndromes result in agenesis of the CC (AgCC) and have an associated genetic etiology [5],[6]. AgCC can result from defects during different steps of callosal development, including cell proliferation, migration, or a failure in axonal guidance within the CC [6].\n\nStudies to date suggest that a specialized population of glia adjacent to the midline are central for the formation of the CC [7]–[13]. The primitive astroglial cells of the “glial” sling form a bridge-like structure at the midline between the two lateral ventricles and are required for the development of the CC [12],[14],[15]. Additional glial structures in the CC were described: radial glial cells in the glial wedge (GW) and astrocytes in the indusium griseum (IG) [6],[7],[10]. Recent observations in mice and humans showed that many neurons are also present within the “glial” sling [16],[17]. Similarly, scattered neurons were observed within the cat CC during early postnatal life [18],[19]. However, whether these populations have a specific function during development has not been investigated.\n\nIn this paper, we characterize the embryonic midline cellular organization at times prior to and during the formation of the CC. Through this effort, we discovered that in mouse embryos, uncharacterized GABAergic neurons intermix with glutamatergic neurons within the entire CC white matter. Here, we explore the possibility that these populations act in conjunction with midline glial cells to mediate the formation of the CC. We first investigated the identity of these populations and their spatial organization relative to ingrowing callosal axons. To determine whether these populations are functionally important, we examined the consequences of genetic ablation of a subpopulation of neurons as well as testing whether neuronal cells of the CC contribute to axonal guidance there. We show that the two neuronal populations that transiently populate the CC form a complex cellular network and that CC GABAergic interneurons are required for the proper organization of this network. Furthermore, ex vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons of the CC are able to attract callosal axons.\n\nWith regards to the signaling pathways that contribute to the formation of the CC, a number of studies have demonstrated that midline glial cells are the principal CC guidepost cells and secrete guidance factors that channel the callosal axons into the correct path [7]–[13]. These guidance signaling factors include Netrin1/DCC, Slit2/Robo1, ephrins/Eph, Semaphorin/Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1), and Wnt [5],[6],[20]–[28]. Mutant mice for these guidance cues and their receptors exhibit callosal defects that range from minor, with few axons leaving the callosal track, to severe, with complete AgCC.\n\nAlthough the Semaphorin/Npn-1 signaling had been shown to be essential for CC development, the specific semaphorin ligand involved in this process, its source within the midline, as well as its precise function, remained to be determined [26],[29]. In this study, we show that the transient population of CR-positive glutamatergic neurons expresses Sema3C and that either the ectopic transplantation of glutamatergic neurons or the ectopic expression of this ligand is sufficient to attract callosal axons. The use of Sema3C knockout (KO) mice confirms a novel and essential role of this factor in the pathfinding of callosal axons. Taken together, these results reveal that transient GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons are required for the formation of the CC. The present work, therefore, gives new insights into the mechanisms involved in axon guidance and implicates that transient neuronal populations work in conjunction with their glial partners in the guidance of callosal axons.\n\nResults\n\nGlutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons Populate the Neonatal CC\n\nPrevious work has implicated the “glial” sling as central for the establishment of the CC [11],[12]. Despite its name, the sling has been shown to contain at least one neuronal population whose function to date is undetermined [17]. As a starting point for investigating whether this neuronal population, and perhaps others, contribute to the formation of the CC, we undertook an immunological analysis of this region during embryonic and postnatal development. In addition to glial cells, upon immunostaining with antibodies against βIII-tubulin, MAP2A, and NeuN, we detected a large number of neurons, not only within the “glial” sling, but also within the entire white matter of the developing CC from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) until postnatal day 14 (P14). In particular, our molecular analysis revealed two distinct neuronal subpopulations. One that includes the population previously described as “sling neurons” was comprised of a population of differentiated glutamatergic neurons (Figure 1). We found that this population expressed the homeobox transcription factor Emx1 and T-box transcription factor Tbr1, which are known to promote glutamatergic fate [30]–[32], the type 1 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the calcium binding protein calretinin (CR) (Figure 1Ai–1Aii to 1Bi–1Bii and unpublished data). Nearly all the CR-positive embryonic neurons of the CC intermediate zone (IZ) coexpressed the glutamatergic marker Tbr1 (91.7±1.3% at E16.5, n = 1,415) (Figure S1Ai). The other population was composed of GABAergic interneurons and was identified using either: i) a GAD67-GFP mouse line in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is reliably expressed within GABAergic neurons [33] (Figure 1Ci–1Cii to 1Fi–1Fii) or ii) a Mash1-GFP transgenic mouse line (Ascl1, Mammalian achaete-scute homolog) (GENSAT) that labels telencephalic GABAergic interneurons derived from Mash1-expressing progenitors of the ventral telencephalon [34],[35] (Figure S1Ci–S1Cii, S1Di–S1Dii and Figure S4Ei). A careful analysis of the colocalization between CR and GAD67-GFP in the neurons of the CC IZ indicates that these two neuronal population are exclusive at embryonic ages (0.7±0.2% at E16.5, n = 1,907; and 1.4±0.4%, n = 1,898 at E18.5) (Figure 1Ci–1Cii to 1Ei–1Eii and Figure S1Bi). The two neuronal population identified by the expression of CR or GAD67-GFP included half of the CC IZ cells at embryonic ages (46% at E16.5, n = 5,561; 53% at E18.5, n = 6,495). At E16.5, the CR-positive glutamatergic neurons constitute 73.6±0.012% of these neurons, whereas the GAD67-GFP–positive GABAergic interneurons constitute 25.9±0.012% (n = 2,580; Figure S1Bii). At E18.5, the proportion of both neuronal cell types is even (51.0±0.026% for CR+ neurons, 48.3±0.025% for GAD67-GFP+ neurons, n = 3,442; Figure S1Biii). As expected, the CR-positive glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic interneurons did not express any of the glial markers nestin, GLAST, and GFAP (Figure S1Ci–S1Cii to S1Ei–S1Evi and unpublished data) previously found on early astroglial cells of the CC, IG, and GW [10].\n\nTransient CC Neuronal Populations Are Located along the Path of Callosal Axons\n\nWe wished to determine whether CR-positive glutamatergic and GAD67/Mash1-GFP–positive GABAergic neurons are present at times and in a spatial distribution consistent with their contribution to the formation of CC axonal paths. As such, we undertook a longitudinal analysis of these populations during development to establish their relationship to callosal axons.\n\nBetween E12.5 and E15.5, the glutamatergic CR-positive neurons occupy a strategic midline position at the corticoseptal boundary (CSB) (Figure 1Ci–1Cii, arrowheads). As such, they occupy this area prior to any callosal axons entering this region (Figure S2Ai–S2Aiv). At this stage, the GAD67/Mash1-GFP–positive interneurons are still migrating within the marginal zone, subplate, IZ, and subventricular zone of the frontal cortical area (Figure 1Ci).\n\nAt E16.5, GAD67/Mash1-GFP neurons intermix with the CR neurons at the midline and in the lateral part of the CC (Figure 1Di–1Dii). At this age, CC pioneer callosal axons start to cross the midline [36],[37], whereas later-growing axons originating from the frontal cortex just approach the lateral border of the CC (Figure S2Bi–S2Bii and S2Ci–S2Cii). All these axons expressing the transmembrane receptor Npn-1 come into contact with both the CR-positive glutamatergic neurons (Figure 2Ai–2Aii and Figure 2Gi) and GAD67/Mash1-GFP–positive interneurons (Figure 2Di–2Dii and Figure 2Gi) while growing through the CC.\n\nFrom E18.5 to P3, CR-positive neurons are positioned topographically in three stripes within anatomically distinct regions of the main body of the CC (Figure 1Ei–1Eii, open arrowheads). They were located: i) at the border of the IG and of the cingulate cortex (CCi), ii) in the middle of the white matter of the CC, and iii) in the “glial” sling at the border of the septum (SEP) and in the region of the GW. The three stripes of glutamatergic CR-positive neurons delineate both a ventral and a dorsal CC axonal path (Figure 2Bi–2Bii, Figure 2Ci–2Cii, open arrows, and Figure 2Gii). Labeling using carbocyanine dyes showed that these dorsal and ventral axonal paths originate from distinct mediolateral cortical areas (Figure 2Ei–2Eii, Figure 2Fi–2Fii, and Figure S2Di–S2Div). This dorsoventral organization was further delineated by the restricted expression pattern of receptors for axon guidance molecules such as Npn-1 (Figure 2Bi–2Bii and Figure S2F) and Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) (Figure S2H) dorsally, and ephrinA5 binding sites ventrally (Figure 2Ci–2Cii and Figure S2G). By contrast, at this age, GAD67/Mash1-GFP–positive neurons are more diffusely distributed within the entire white matter of the CC and are seen surrounding the growing commissural axons (Figure 1Ei–1Eii, Figure 2Ei–2Eii, and 2Fi–2Fii).\n\nGlutamatergic neurons of the CC expressing CR disappeared abruptly between P1 and P3, whereas GAD67/Mash1-GFP GABAergic neurons disappeared progressively in a spatiotemporal gradient, from P7 at the midline, until P21 in the extreme lateral part of the CC (Figure 1Fi–1Fii and Figure S3Ai–S3Aii to S3Di–S3Dii). Cleaved caspase 3 staining and ultrastructural changes showed that both neuronal populations of the CC died at early postnatal ages (Figure S3). Our ultrastructural study revealed that dying neurons adopt different morphological types: a non-lysosomal vesiculate type (type IIIB) for GAD67-GFP–positive GABAergic interneurons or an autophagic type (type II) for glutamatergic neurons [38].\n\nOur results, therefore, demonstrate that the CC is more heterogeneous than previously thought. Specifically, the entire CC white matter contains transient CR-positive glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic interneurons that correspond to the organization of the callosal projections within this region. Furthermore, their location and the timing of their appearance raise the possibility that these neurons actively participate in the guidance of callosal axons.\n\nTopographic Positioning between the Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons, and the Developing Callosal Axons\n\nTo study the spatial relationships between CC neurons and callosal axons, we used electron microscopy and 3-D analysis of high-resolution confocal image stacks.\n\nElectron microscopy and pre-embedding immunocytochemistry showed CC neurons apposed to one another, forming a complex cellular network (stars) around callosal axons (arrowheads) (Figure S4A to S4Di–S4Dii and unpublished data). To determine how glutamatergic CR-positive and GABAergic GAD67/Mash1-GFP–positive neurons participate in this cellular network, we generated isosurface maps (Figure S4Eii) using immunostaining to label both neuronal populations and cell nuclei (CR, GFP, Hoechst) (Figure S4Ei). Isosurface reconstructions allowed us to explore the geometry of this cellular organization using the navigator function of IMARIS 4.3 software (Figure S4Eiii–S4Evii and Video S1). The 3-D visualization showed that both CR-positive glutamatergic neurons and GAD67/Mash1-GFP interneurons contributed in forming the “walls” of a complex cellular network surrounding callosal axons inside the CC (Figure S4Eiii–S4Evii and Video S1). Our observations thus indicate that the two neuronal populations that transiently populate the CC form a dense cellular network that interacts intimately with the growing commissural axons.\n\nCC Formation Is Impaired in Mash1 Mutant Mice Lacking GABAergic Interneurons\n\nGiven the density and complexity of the neuronal network that we identified, it is relatively difficult to unravel its function in CC formation. As a first step, we analyzed the brains of mutant mice defective for the production of GABAergic interneurons. Mash1 is a transcription factor expressed in GABAergic progenitors of the ventral telencephalon and its inactivation severely impairs the production of cortical interneurons [34],[35]. Consistently, we found that the CC of Mash1 mutant embryos was nearly devoid of GABAergic interneurons (GABA-positive neurons: 1.390±0.146 neurons/mm2 in CC of wild-type (WT) mice versus 0.167±0.055 neurons/mm2 in CC of Mash1−/− mice, p&lt;0.001) (compare Figure S5Ci–S5Cii with S5Di–S5Dii). To investigate how the lack of GABAergic interneurons affects CC formation, we also examined whether the other CC cell types are impaired by Mash1 inactivation. At E16.5, the CC glial cells' localization, morphology, and expression of guidance factors (ephrins, semaphorins, and Slit2) were not affected in Mash1 mutant embryos (Figure S5Ei–S5Eii and S5Fi–S5Fii, and Figure S6). By contrast, some glutamatergic CR-positive neurons were displaced ventrally at the midline (compare Figure 3Ci–3Cii and 3Di–3Dii, arrowheads). Thus, in Mash1 mutants, although the glial scaffold appears normal, the CC neuronal network is severely affected, with a lack of GABAergic interneurons and a displacement of CR-positive glutamatergic neurons at the midline.\n\nOur analysis showed that Mash1 inactivation leads to major alterations of axonal paths in the CC (compare Figure 3A with 3B, compare Figure 3Ci–3Cii with 3Di–3Dii, and see Figure S5Gi–S5Gv with S5Hi–S5Hv). From E16.5 to E18.5, Mash1−/− embryos exhibited partial (Figure 3Di–3Dii and Figure S6) to complete (Figure 3B and Figure S5Hi–S5Hiv) AgCC, with few axons, if any, crossing the midline. Although axons were impaired in midline crossing, they expressed normal levels of L1, Npn-1, and DCC guidance receptors (unpublished data, Figure 3Di–3Dii, and Figure S6Gi–S6Gii and S6Hi–S6Hii). Instead, callosal axons entered the IG or the SEP and formed two large ectopic fascicles known as Probst bundles that are characteristic of acallosal mammalian forebrains (Figure 3B and Figure 3Di–3Dii, open arrowheads). In addition, DiI-labeled axons that are normally located in the dorsal and ventral paths of the CC intermingle in Mash1−/− embryos before reaching the midline (compare Figure S5Gi–S5Gv and S5Hi–S5Hv). On the other hand, in Mash1−/−, the area specification of the dorsal telencephalon [39], and the laminar distribution of the Tbr1-positive cortical layers V–VI that contain pyramidal callosal neurons and of Sabtb2-positive callosally projecting neurons were normal (unpublished data, and compare Figure S5Ai–S5Aii and S5Bi–S5Bii).\n\nTo investigate whether this severe axon guidance phenotype was due to defects in the CC region rather than to altered development of other regions in the Mash1 mutants, we performed transplantations of the CC into E16.5 telencephalic slices, using different combinations of WT and Mash1−/− embryos (Figure 3 and Figure S7). In our slice assays, as in in vivo [36],[37], the callosal axons from dorsolateral neocortex develop later than pioneer axons, and after E16.5, their growth cones enter the CC region in successive streams over a period of several days (Figure S2Bi–S2Bii to S2Ci–S2Cii). When dorsal cortical explants from GFP-positive Mash1−/− mice were transplanted into WT slices (n = 7 out of 7), GFP-labeled callosal axons crossed the midline, whereas transplantations of dorsal cortex from GFP-positive WT mice into Mash1−/− slices (n = 6 out of 6) lead to an impairment in axonal midline crossing (Figure S7). These experiments suggested that callosal axons mistargeting in Mash1 mutant embryos is due to defects in CC midline and surrounding structures. To further investigate this issue, we then performed reversion experiments (Figure 3). When dorsal cortical explants from GFP-positive WT mice and explants of the CC region from WT donors were transplanted into a WT brain slice, a majority of GFP-labeled callosal axons crossed the midline (Figure 3Ei–3Eiii; n = 5 out of 6), thereby reproducing the in vivo behavior of callosal axons. By contrast, with GFP-positive Mash1−/− cortical and Mash1−/− CC explants transplanted into Mash1−/− slices, GFP-positive callosal axons failed to cross the midline (Figure 3Fi–3Fiii; n = 3 out of 3). We then tested whether the transplantation of WT CC into Mash1−/− mutant slices could restore correct pathfinding of GFP-positive Mash1−/− callosal axons (Figure 3Gi–3Giii). Remarkably, WT CC restored normal axonal guidance of the majority of Mash1−/− callosal axons, but only when the transplant comprised the medial and lateral parts of the CC that contain the GABAergic interneuron population we have identified (Figure 3Gi–3Giii; n = 4 out of 6). Transplantation experiments of GAD67-GFP–positive WT CC into WT slices confirmed that CC GABAergic interneurons remain through the CC transplant and maintained their initial organization after several days in vitro (Figure 4Di–4Diii; n = 4 out of 4). Therefore, callosal axons misrouting observed in Mash1 mutant embryos is largely due to defects in the CC region.\n\nAltogether, our experiments indicate that Mash1 inactivation does not impair callosal pyramidal neurons differentiation but leads to a severe modification of the CC neuronal network. These results suggest that CC GABAergic interneurons, which are lacking in Mash1−/− mice, may participate in callosal axons guidance and support the idea that the integrity of this neuronal CC network is important for normal callosal axons navigation.\n\nChemoattractive Activity of the Two CC Neuronal Populations\n\nTo further understand how CC neurons contribute to callosal axon navigation, we tested whether a CC region enriched in GABAergic and/or CR-positive glutamatergic neurons could promote the growth of callosal axons in coexplant and heterotopic graft experiments (Figures 4, 5, and 6).\n\nAt first, we examined whether the CC region exerts an attractive influence on cortical axons by placing E16.5 lateral CC explants, comprising the two neuronal populations of interest, adjacent to explants of medial (cingulate or frontal) cortex (Figure 4Ai–4Aii). At E16.5, after 2 d in vitro, outgrowth in the quadrant closest to the CC aggregate was increased for axons originating from the cingulate and the frontal cortical area compared to that in the quadrant furthest away from the aggregate, indicating chemoattraction (Figure 4Ai–4Aii and 4C). By contrast, the septal and the IG regions were found to exert a repulsive action on cortical axons (Figure 4Bi–4Bii, 4C, and unpublished data). At E16.5, after the cerebral hemispheres have fused, it was possible to ascertain the callosal identity of the axons, by using CC organotypic slices. DiI-labeled axons growing in E16.5 slice preparations from GAD67-GFP slices (unpublished data, n = 17 out of 22) or in E16.5 WT slices grafted with a CC from a GAD67-GFP embryo (Figure 4Di–4Diii; n = 4 out of 4) navigated across the midline as they normally do in vivo. In contrast, when small explants of E16.5 GAD67-GFP–positive lateral CC containing both neuronal populations were inserted into E16.5 heterotopic septal region of host slices, some DiI-labeled callosal axons were deflected from their normal trajectory, penetrated the SEP and innervated the transplants (Figure 4Ei–4Eiii, arrowheads; n = 7 out of 8). The enrichment of both types of CC neurons within small E16.5 lateral CC explants was confirmed by using GAD67-GFP–positive explants (Figure 4Aii and Figure 4Di–4Diii to 4Fi–4Fiii) and CR immunohistochemistry (Figure 4Fi–4Fiii), whereas the lack of astroglial cells was demonstrated by GFAP immunohistochemistry (unpublished data). Thus, these observations reveal the existence of an attractive activity for callosal axons located in the neuron-rich region of the CC.\n\nWe next determined the respective contribution of GAD67-GFP–positive GABAergic interneurons and CR-positive glutamatergic neurons of the CC to this guidance activity. To directly test the involvement of CC GABAergic neurons, we grafted in the SEP, explants of E14.5 or E16.5 GAD67-GFP medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (Figure 5Ai–5Aiii), which generate the GABAergic interneurons of the CC (unpublished data). Interestingly, numerous axons left the callosal track, penetrated the repulsive SEP, and grew through migrating GAD67-GFP–positive interneurons originating from the MGE transplant (Figure 5Ai–5Aiii; n = 12 out of 15 for E14.5 MGE, and n = 17 out of 22 for E16.5 MGE). This attraction was specific for MGE-derived interneurons, since control explants of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) did not attract callosal axons (Figure 5Bi–5Biii; n = 5 out of 6). These observations strongly support the idea that CC GABAergic neurons directly contribute to the attraction of callosal axons. To estimate whether CC GABAergic neurons are the sole contributors of this guidance activity, we compared in coexplant experiments the quantity of cortical axons that were attracted by WT or Mash1−/− E16.5 lateral CC explants (Figure 5Ci–5Cii, 5Di–5Dii, and 5E). Mash1−/− explants of the lateral CC, that contained glutamatergic neurons but are devoid of GABAergic interneurons (Figure S5Di and S5Fi), were found to exert a reduced chemoattraction on cortical axons compared to WT lateral CC explants that contain both neuronal populations (Figure 5E; −40%, p&lt;0.05). The equal number of CR-positive neurons within small lateral CC explants of Mash1−/− compared to WT was confirmed by using CR immunohistochemistry (unpublished data). These results show that CC GABAergic interneurons contribute to part of the attractive activity of the CC on cortical axons.\n\nTo further test whether CR-positive glutamatergic neurons can also directly attract callosal axons, we took advantage of the fact that the E14.5 developing CC comprises CR-positive glutamatergic neurons and lacks GAD67-GFP–expressing GABAergic interneurons (Figure 1Ci–1Cii). Coexplant experiments performed at E14.5 showed that cortical axons from the CCi were attracted by CC explants comprising only CR-positive neurons (Figure 6Ai–6Aii and 6B). In addition, heterochronic transplantation of E14.5 developing CC into the SEP of a E16.5 WT slice revealed that regions enriched in CR-positive neurons (Figure 6Ci–6Ciii) provided an attractive environment for callosal axons (Figure 6Di–6Diii, arrowheads; n = 11 out of 13).\n\nAltogether, coexplant and transplantation experiments indicate that CC neuronal populations exert an attracting influence on callosal axons, which is mediated by both GABAergic and glutamatergic CR-positive neurons.\n\nSema3C Is Expressed by CR-Positive Glutamatergic Neurons and Contributes to the Attractive Activity on Callosal Axons\n\nIn search for candidate molecular signals mediating the attractive activity on callosal axons, we found that Sema3C is strongly expressed only in the subcortical white matter and especially the CC region (Figure 7Ai and Figure S6Ii–S6Iii), as previously observed [26]. In the CC, colabeling experiments revealed that Sema3C mRNA expression is restricted to CR-positive glutamatergic neurons (Figure 7Aii–7Aiv). The Sema3C mRNAs were never detected in GAD67-GFP–positive interneurons (Figure S8Ai–S8Aii) or GFAP-positive astroglial cells (Figure S8Bi–S8Bii). Since Sema3C has been described to act as an attractive factor for neocortical and cingulate axons in vitro [26],[40],[41], CR-positive glutamatergic neurons of the CC might exert their attractive effect on callosal axons through the action of Sema3C.\n\nTo test this possibility, aggregates of Sema3C-expressing HEK293T cells were placed in the repulsive septal region of E16.5 WT slices (Figure 7Bi). Callosal axons were misrouted from their normal path and invaded cell aggregates expressing Sema3C (Figure 7Biii–7Biv; arrowheads; n = 13 out of 16), whereas control cell aggregates did not affect the growth of callosal axons (Figure 7Bii; open arrowheads; n = 7 out of 8). Thus, localized expression of Sema3C in slice cultures directs callosal axon outgrowth. In addition, experiments made with explants of E14.5 and E16.5 cingulate or frontal cortices and aggregates of Sema3C-expressing HEK293T cells indicate that pioneer cortical axons and later-growing callosal axons are chemo-attracted by Sema3C as early as E14.5 (unpublished data).\n\nTo determine the in vivo function of Sema3C in the developing CC, we examined the brains of mutant mice inactivated for the Sema3C gene (Figure 7Di–7Dv and Figure S8Di–S8Dii). CR and GFAP immunohistochemistry at E16.5 and E18.5 indicated that the position and organization of the CR-positive glutamatergic neurons and glial cell populations within the CC is indistinguishable in WT and Sema3C−/− mice, suggesting that their development is not sensitive to the loss of Sema3C (compare Figure S8Ci with S8Di and Figure S8Cii with Figure S8Dii, respectively). Sema3C−/− mice exhibited partial to severe AgCC. When the agenesis was partial, all dorsal Npn-1–positive axons failed to cross the midline, whereas part of ventral callosal axons labeled for NPY were able to cross (compare Figure 7Ci–7Cv with Figure 7Di–7Dv). Misguided callosal axons formed Probst bundles within the IG (Figure 7Di–7Div, arrowheads). In some cases, Sema3C−/− mice displayed severe AgCC characterized by midline fusion defects and a complete failure of any callosal axons to cross the midline at the level of the CC main body (compare Figure S8Ci–S8Cii with Figure S8Di–S8Dii).\n\nTaken together, these results reveal that guidance mechanisms of callosal axons rely in part on Sema3C, which contributes to the chemoattractive effect of CR-positive glutamatergic neurons on callosal axons.\n\nSema3C Directs Cortical Axon Growth via Npn-1\n\nThe precise identity of the endogenous neuronal receptor for Sema3C remains unclear. In vitro, Sema3C binds with high affinity to both Npn-1 and its close homolog Npn-2 [42]. Since Npn-1, but not Npn-2, is expressed on callosal axons (see Figure 2Ai–2Aii, 2Bi–2Bii, 2Di–2Dii, Figure 3Ci–3Cii, and 7Ci–7Civ; and unpublished data) and Semaphorin/Npn-1 signaling is critical for CC development [26],[29], we examined whether Npn-1 was necessary to allow callosal axons to respond to Sema3C. We placed aggregates of Sema3C-expressing HEK293T cells adjacent to explants of E15.5 medial cortex (Figure 8Ai–8Aii). After 2 d in vitro, axonal growth in the quadrant closest to the aggregate was increased by 70% at E15.5 compared to that in the quadrant farthest away from the aggregate (p&lt;0.01; Figure 8Ai–8Aii), indicating chemoattraction. Consistently, adding recombinant Sema3C (5 to 10 nM) to dissociated neurons from medial cortex increased axon length by 35% compared to the control condition (p&lt;0.001; Figure 8Bi–8Bii). Npn-1 blocking antibodies abolished both the attractive and growth-promoting responses of cortical neurons to Sema3C (Figure 8Ai–8Aii and 8Bi–8Bii) and disturbed DiI-labeled callosal axons navigation in E16.5 brain slices (unpublished data, n = 14 out of 19). To exclude the possibility of nonspecific antibody binding, we knocked down endogenous Npn-1 in dissociated cortical neurons using two different small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences that efficiently silenced expression of Npn-1 without affecting Npn-2 levels, as assessed by antibody staining (unpublished data). Remarkably, both siRNAs completely abrogated the positive effect of Sema3C on axon growth (Figure 8Ci–8Cii). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Npn-1 is necessary for mediating the attractive response of callosal axons to Sema3C.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we show that two transient neuronal subpopulations, one CR/glutamatergic and the other Mash1/GABAergic, occupy a strategic position for contributing to the guidance of nascent callosal axons. Mash1−/− mice that lack GABAergic neurons possess major pathfinding defects in the CC, and grafting WT CC comprising midline neurons in a Mash1−/− slice rescued this phenotype. In addition, we show that both neuronal populations possess the ability to chemoattract callosal axons and that this activity is dependent in part on Sema3C function in the CR-positive glutamatergic population. Consistent with this observation, Sema3C is required in vivo for the proper development of the CC pathway. Taken together, our work provides strong evidence for a role in callosal axon guidance by the two transient populations we characterized in this study. Notably, these activities appear distinct from those emanating from glial guidepost cells. As such, our findings show that two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations converge towards the midline and form a cellular network that is essential for controlling callosal axon navigation (model in Figure 2Gi–2Gii).\n\nRoles for CC Neurons in the Guidance of Callosal Axons\n\nWe have revealed the existence of two populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that although arising from distinct sources, converge on the interhemispheric fissure prior to the arrival of CC axons. The precise origins of these two CC neuronal populations have yet to be determined. Our observations suggest that CR-positive glutamatergic neurons invade the CC through a tangential subpial migration and may thus correspond to cortical pioneer neurons that originate from the retrobulbar ventricle [43],[44]. In contrast, our fate-mapping and tracing experiments indicate that the GABAergic interneurons of the CC originate in the MGE (unpublished data) as described for a majority of cortical interneurons in mice [45]–[51].\n\nA few studies have reported the presence of neurons within or around the CC, such as CR-positive neurons in the mouse and human “glial” sling [16],[17] and scattered neurons in the cat CC during early postnatal life [18],[19]. It was proposed that these neurons were migrating through the CC [19] or below the CC in the sling [10]. Our study provides an evaluation of the positioning, development, and character of these populations and demonstrates that their presence within the CC is transient.\n\nMoreover, our data strongly support a requirement for these neurons in the guidance of callosal axons. First, we identified a close structural association between the neurons of the CC and the callosal axons during embryonic development. The intimate relationship between these neurons and the incoming callosal afferents is further bolstered by our 3-D analysis showing that CR-positive glutamatergic neurons form a complex multicellular network with the transient GABAergic interneuron population we identified. The integrity of the CC multicellular network formed by GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons is required for normal CC axonal navigation, as shown by both our analysis of Mash1 mutant mice and our grafting experiments. Our present work reveals that the guidance of callosal axons is actively mediated through the chemotropic actions of the two novel neuronal populations of the CC that we examined. Moreover, our study demonstrates that CR-positive glutamatergic neurons exert a direct attractive influence on callosal axons via Sema3C expression.\n\nThis function of the CC neurons fits well with the emerging notion that migrating neurons may have a role in axon pathfinding. It has recently been found that thalamocortical axon growth relies on the early tangential migration of a population of GABAergic neurons within the ventral telencephalon [52]. In addition, the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) projections are guided by early generated neurons, named “LOT neurons,” that migrate tangentially [53],[54]. Similar functions have been reported for CD44-positive neurons in the guidance of retinal axons at the optic chiasm [55] and Cajal-Retzius reelin/calretinin-positive neurons in the establishment of hippocampal projections [56].\n\nCC Neurons Participate in Callosal Axon Guidance via Sema3C/Npn-1 Signaling\n\nOur work demonstrates that a neuronal-rich region of the CC attracts callosal axons, at least in part through the expression by glutamatergic CC neurons of the guidance cue Sema3C. Initially, the Sema3C gene is strongly expressed by guidepost CR-positive glutamatergic neurons adjacent to the midline prior to the entrance of callosal axons. In organotypic slices, Sema3C-expressing HEK293T cells attract callosal axons into heterotopic regions. These observations, using a specific guidance assay for CC axons, extend previous in vitro studies showing that Sema3C acts as an attractive guidance signal for neocortical and cingulate axons [26],[40],[41]. It was known that the Sema3C repulsive activity is mediated via Npn-1/Npn-2 heterodimers or Npn-2/Npn-2 homodimers [57], but the nature of the receptor mediating the attractive effect was not yet characterized. Here, we show that inhibiting selectively the Npn-1 receptor abolished completely the attractive and outgrowth-promoting effects of Sema3C. Moreover, callosal axons are found to express Npn-1, but not Npn-2. Therefore, our results reveal that Npn-1 can serve as a Sema3C receptor to mediate chemoattraction. Neuropilins require a signaling coreceptor to mediate semaphorin function. For example, PlexinAs and L1-CAM are responsible for transducing Sema3A repulsive response via Npn-1 in cortical neurons [58],[59]. Other transmembrane proteins, including the tyrosine kinase receptors Met, ERBB2, OTK, and VEGFR2, participate in semaphorin responses by regulating diverse intracellular signaling events and functional outcomes [60]–[62]. The transducer that mediates Sema3C attractive response remains so far undefined. It will be important to analyze whether the assembly of specific subunits combinations confers unique ligand-binding properties of semaphorin receptors, and whether different Npn-1 receptor complexes coexist on cortical axons, dictating either Sema3A-mediated repulsion or Sema3C-mediated attraction.\n\nAlthough it has long been recognized that Sema3C regulates the formation of the cardiovascular system [63], its in vivo function in the central nervous system remains relatively unexplored. Here, we observed that the development of the CC path depends on Sema3C expression. Indeed, callosal axons fail to grow or navigate correctly through the CC of mutant mice lacking Sema3C gene function. These results shed new light on previous studies showing that mice in which Npn-1 is unable to bind Semas exhibit CC axonal pathfinding defects [26],[29]. The similarity between the Npn-1Sema− mice and Sema3C−/− mice suggests that Sema3C is the ligand required for directing Npn-1–mediated callosal axon navigation. Taken together, these results reveal that CR-positive glutamatergic neurons within the dorsal midline territory control callosal axon navigation, at least in part, through a Sema3C-dependent mechanism. Therefore, transient CC guidepost neurons play a central role in mediating the guidance cues required for callosal axon pathway formation.\n\nNeurons and Glia Cooperate to Guide Callosal Axons\n\nPrevious studies on CC development emphasized the role of glial cells. In Silver and Ogawa's study [11], aberrant callosal axons maintained a potential to regrow upon the surface of a glia-covered scaffold after mouse embryos were made surgically acallosal at E16.5. Other studies indicate that astroglial cells of the GW and IG direct callosal pathfinding at the midline by secreting guidance cues [7],[8]. Our work demonstrates that, in addition, CC formation requires the presence of specific neuronal populations. What is the relative contribution of neurons and glia to CC formation? Preliminary results indicate that neurons and astroglial cells of the CC intermingle to form a complex 3-D structure and that glutamatergic CR-positive neurons lie along the radial glial processes. Therefore, in addition to secreting guidance factors, glial cell populations may aid in the establishment of the CC neurons through more complex trophic or signaling interactions. Indeed, the interplay between the neuronal and glial cells within the midline will be intriguing to investigate in the future.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\n\nAll animal research has been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. WT mice maintained in a C57Bl/6 genetic background were used for developmental analysis of the CC. We used heterozygous GAD67_GFP (Δneo) mice [33], which will be referred to as GAD67-GFP mice in this work. Experimental animals were obtained by mating C57Bl/6 mice with heterozygous GAD67_GFP mice. GAD67_GFP embryos can be recognized by their GFP fluorescence. NINDS GENSAT BAC Transgenic mice for Ascl1 (Ascl1-EGFP)1Gsat/Mmnc (MMRC) referred to as Mash1-GFP in this work were maintained in a C57Bl/6 background and were recognized by their GFP fluorescence. Mash1 KO heterozygous mice were maintained in a mixed C57Bl/6 and DBA background and crossed to produce homozygous embryos [64]. Mash1 heterozygous mice were also crossed with a transgenic mouse line expressing GFP ubiquitously [65] in order to produce GFP-positive Mash1−/− embryos. PCR genotyping of these lines was performed as described previously [52]. Heterozygous embryos did not show any phenotype and were used as controls. Sema3C heterozygous mice were maintained in a CD1 background and mated to obtain Sema3C−/− embryos. The genotype of the offspring was determined by PCR as described [63]. For staging of embryos, midday of the day of vaginal plug formation was considered as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\n\nEmbryos were collected by Caesarean section and killed by decapitation. Their brains were dissected and fixed by immersion overnight at 4°C in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Postnatal mice were deeply anaesthetized and perfused with the same fixative, and their brains postfixed 4 h. Brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and cut in coronal 50-µm-thick frozen sections for staining.\n\nProduction of AP-Sema3C\n\nAP-Sema3C was obtained by cloning cDNA encoding mouse Sema3C in pAPtag-5 vector (GenHunter Corporation), which contains a sequence coding for secreted alkaline phosphatase. To produce AP-tagged proteins, HEK293T cells were transfected with the AP-Sema3C vector or empty pAPtag-5 vector as control, using lipofectamin plus (Invitrogen) or fugen (Roche). After 3 d of culture in Opti-MEM serum-free medium, the supernatant was collected and concentrated using Centricon filters (Millipore). AP activity was assessed as described [29].\n\nSlice Culture Experiments\n\nWe developed an in vitro model of CC organotypic slices adapted from a previously published telencephalic slice culture preparation [45],[52],[66]–[68] and CC preparation [7]. Embryos were placed in ice cold dissecting medium (MEM Gibco ref 11012-044 with 15 mM glucose and 10 mM Tris [pH 7–9]). Brains were removed and embedded in 3% low-melting point agarose (Invitrogen); 250-µm-thick coronal sections were then cut using a vibratome filled with cold dissecting medium, and slices at the level of the CC were collected in the same medium. CC slices were cultured on nuclepore Track-Etch membrane (1-µm pore size; Whatman) or PET cell inserts (1-µm pore size; Beckton-Dickinson) in tissue dishes containing 1 ml of BME/HBSS (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine, 5% horse serum, and Pen/Strep [52].\n\nFor CC transplantation experimentation, slices from E16.5 embryos were selected since at this early stage of development, the CC contained its whole complement of guide post cells and only the pioneer CC axons of ventral cingulate origin [36],[37]. It is critical that cultured hemispheres are already joined for the differentiation of the CC in vitro. In our slice assay, as in vivo, the callosal axons from dorsolateral neocortex develop later, and after E16.5, their growth cones enter the CC region in successive streams over a period of several days. Our slice assay performed at E16.5 allowed us to study: (1) the function of both CC guidepost neuronal populations that have reached the CC midline at that stage, (2) the outgrowth properties of the majority of callosal axons that are growing through the CC after E16.5, and (3) the effects of transplantations and pharmacological (guidance factors, lesions) manipulation on callosal axons navigations.\n\nTo define the putative function of CC neurons in attracting callosal axons, the transplantation assay was performed at E16.5 to analyze the navigation of WT early callosal axons labeled for DiI after insertion of small DiI crystals into the frontal cortex of slices. Small explants of E14.5 corticoseptal boundary comprising only CR-positive glutamatergic neurons or E16.5 lateral CC IZ comprising both neuronal populations were excised using tungsten needles and transplanted into the SEP of E16.5 host slices. After incubation for 48–64 h, the slices were fixed, and axon trajectories through the various regions were analyzed by confocal analysis. In most of our transplantation experiments of CC (&gt;90%), we observed that axons grew without any difficulty through small or large transplants, and only cases with axons penetrating into the grafted explants were counted as positive results for attraction.\n\nWe found that CC GABAergic interneurons are generated by the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) from E14.5 to E16.5 (unpublished data). To define the putative function of the CC GABAergic interneurons we transplanted small explants of E14.5 or E16.5 MGE into the SEP of an E16.5 slice as described above. As a control, we used small explants of E16.5 lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) that do not generate CC GABAergic interneurons. In this assay, cases with axons growing along GAD67-GFP+ interneurons originating from the grafted explants were counted as positive results for attraction.\n\nFor the Sema3C study, HEK293T cells were transfected with an AP-control plasmid or an AP-Sema3C plasmid (see above). To highlight HEK293T transfected cells, a pEGFP plasmid was coexpressed. Aggregates of HEK293T transfected cells prepared by high-density culture within an inverted drop of medium were transplanted into the CCi, CC, or SEP of host slices as described before [68]. For the Npn-1 study, the Npn-1–blocking antibody (R&amp;D systems) was added at the final concentration of 5 µg/ml.\n\nFor the Mash1 study, the transplantation assay was performed at E16.5 to analyze the growth of WT (Mash1+/+; Mash1+/−) or Mash1−/− GFP-positive callosal axons within CC of WT (Mash1+/+; Mash1+/−) or Mash1−/− slices. Since heterozygous embryos did not show any phenotype, they were also used as controls. Portions of the frontal cortex with underlying white matter and CC from donor slices were excised using tungsten needles and transplanted into host slices from which the equivalent region had been removed. After incubation for 48–64 h, the slices were fixed and immunostained for GFP before confocal analysis.\n\nCoculture and Dissociated Neuronal Cultures\n\nCocultures were performed as described [52],[69]–[71]. Explants of E14.5, E16.5 CCi, explants of E16.5 frontal cortices, explants of E14.5, E16.5 SEP, or explants of E16.5 IG were cocultured with CC explants of the corresponding ages. Explants of E14.5 and E15.5 CCi, or E14.5, E15, and E16.5 frontal cortex were cocultured with HEK293T cell aggregates secreting AP-Sema3C or control AP. For the Mash1 study, the coexplant assay was performed at E16.5 to analyze the growth of WT (Mash1+/+; Mash1+/−) or Mash1−/− cortical axons confronted with WT (Mash1+/+; Mash1+/−) or Mash1−/− CC.\n\nFor dissociated cell cultures, neurons were dissociated and plated onto polylysine/laminin-coated four-well plates (Nunc) in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 1∶50 B27 (GIBCO), and AP control or AP-Sema3C supernatants (see above). In some experiments, neurons were cultured in the presence of anti–Npn-1 (R&amp;D Systems). Efficient knock-down of Npn-1 was obtained using the following siRNA sequences: 5′-AAUCAGAGUUCCCGACAUAUU-3′ (Npn-1 siRNA1) and 5′-UGUCAAGACUUACAGAGUAUU-3′ (Npn-1 siRNA2). Neurons were coelectroporated with a pCAGGS-GFP vector and with different siRNAs (100 pmol) as described [72]. Quantification of axonal growth and guidance was performed as described before [73], or by using a measuring program built in MatLab software that allows to compare the density of immunolabeled axons in the proximal region facing the source of guidance cues and the distal region.\n\nIn Situ Hybridization\n\nSema3C plasmid was linearized with EcoRI (New England Biolabs) for antisense RNA synthesis by T7 polymerase (Promega) and with XhoI (New England Biolabs) for sense RNA synthesis by T3 polymerase (Promega). EphA4, Npn-1, EphB1 plasmids were linearized with SacI (New England Biolabs) for antisense RNA synthesis by T3 polymerase (Promega). ephrinB2 plasmid was linearized with BamH1 (New England Biolabs) for antisense RNA synthesis by sp6 polymerase (Promega). Slit2 plasmid was linearized with Xba1 (New England Biolabs) for antisense RNA synthesis by T7 polymerase (Promega). For in situ hybridization, brains were dissected and fixed by immersion overnight at 4°C in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Free-floating vibratome sections (100 µm) were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probe as described before [74]. To combine in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, Fast Red (Roche) was used as an alkaline phosphatase fluorescent substrate.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\n\nMonoclonal antibodies were human DCC receptor and NeuN (Chemicon); Nestin (Pharmingen); and SNAP25 (Stemberger Monoclonal). Rat monoclonal antibody was L1 (Chemicon). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were calbindin and calretinin (Swant); GABA (Sigma); GFAP (DAKO); GFP (Molecular Probes); GLAST, Tbr1, and Tbr2 (Chemicon), Satb2 (gift from V. Tarabykin); Emx1 (gift from A. Trembleau); and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling). Goat polyclonal antibodies were calretinin (Swant); Npn-1 and Npn-2 (R&amp;D System); and NPY (gift from W. W. Blessing, Flinders University, Melbourne, Australia). Guinea pig polyclonal antibodies were VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (Chemicon). To label ephrin-A5 binding sites, we used the ephrinA5 chimera human Fc (R&amp;D Systems).\n\nFluorescence immunostaining\n\nUnspecific binding was blocked by adding 2% normal horse serum during preincubation and incubations in 1× PBS solutions containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The primary antibodies were detected with donkey or goat Cy3-, Cy2, Alexa 594, Alexa 488, and Oregon Green antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Molecular Probes). Sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes), mounted on glass slides, and covered in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem). Coexplants were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) and covered in Vectashield.\n\nAxonal Tracing\n\nAfter overnight fixation in 4% PFA at 4°C, fine glass needles covered with the fluorescent carbocyanide dye DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl 3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate or DiA (4-[4-(dihexadecyl amino)styryl]N-methyl-pyridinium iodide (Molecular Probes) were placed in single or multiple locations in the neocortex [75]. After 4–8 wk at 37°C in 4% PFA or PBS to allow dye diffusion, the samples were embedded in 5% agarose and cut into 100-µm-thick sections on a vibratome. Counterstaining was with Hoechst (Molecular Probes).\n\nImaging\n\nFluorescent-stained sections were imaged with confocal microscopes (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta or Leica SP5) equipped with 10×, 20×, 40× oil Plan-NEOFLUAR, and 63× oil, 100× oil Plan-Apochromat objectives. Fluorophore excitation and scanning were done with an Argon laser 458, 488, 514 nm (blue excitation for GFP, Alexa488, CY2, and DiA), with a HeNe1 laser 543 nm (green excitation for Alexa 594, CY3, and DiI) and a Diode laser 405 nm (for Hoechst staining). Z-stacks of 10–15 plans were acquired for each CC coronal section in a multitrack mode avoiding crosstalk artifacts of the fluorochromes. Z-stacks of 40–50 sections were acquired for each CC section for the creation of isosurfaces with Imaris4.3 software.\n\nImaris images processing\n\nAll 3-D Z-stack reconstructions and image processing were performed with Imaris 4.3 software (Bitplane). Some image stacks contained approximately 40 sections each, giving an excellent z-axis resolution. To create real 3-D datasets, we used the mode “Surpass” of Imaris. Single sections of a Z-stack were displayed by using the “Slice” mode of Imaris. The generation of isosurfaces (object defining a surface surrounding voxels located between two threshold values) allowed us to visualize the contours of cells and to delimit the cell-free spaces between the neurons of the CC. Using a navigator function of IMARIS 4.3 software in the “Animation mode,” it was then possible to explore the organization of the cell-free spaces within the thickness of the CC. The Animation mode allows Key-Frame Animation of the exploration of CC slices to be saved in AVI file format. The colocalization between two fluorochromes was calculated and visualized by creating a yellow channel using Imaris. Figures were processed in AdobePhotoshop CS2, and schematic illustrations were produced using Adobe Illustrator CS2.\n\nUltrastructure\n\nE16.5 and E18.5 embryos were killed by decapitation. Brains were dissected and fixed by immersion for 24 h at 4°C in a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with the addition of 2% sucrose. The brains were then rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), postfixed at room temperature for 2 h in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in graded ethanols, and embedded in Epon. The regions containing the CC of the embedded brains were trimmed and mounted on blocks to cut semithin and ultrathin sections. The ultrathin sections were mounted on Formvar-coated single-slot grids and contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate and 0.2% lead citrate.\n\nFor pre-embedding immunocytochemistry, embryonic brains were fixed by immersion in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% sucrose for 24 h. Fifty-micrometer-thick sections were cut with a vibratome and immunoreacted. Endogenous peroxidase reaction was quenched with 0.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, and unspecific binding was blocked by adding 2% normal horse serum during preincubation and incubations in Tris-buffered solutions. The primary antibodies were detected with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the Vector-Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Following the diaminobenzidene reaction, sections were dehydrated and embedded in Epon. The plastic-embedded specimens were prepared for ultrathin sectioning following the same protocol as above.\n\nCC Cell Populations Analysis\n\nIn slices of WT mice, the CR+, Tbr1+, and GAD67-GFP+ neurons in the CC were counted at E16.5 and E18.5 as the number of cells in the CC region from at least five slices per condition. To study the total neuron number through the CC, the values were reported as a percentage of the total number of the cells encountered within the same region of the CC and labeled by Hoechst staining. To study the neuronal subpopulations repartition, the values were reported as a percentage of the total number of labeled neurons encountered within the same region of the CC.\n\nIn slices of WT and Mash1−/− mice, the GABAergic interneurons in CC were counted as the number of neurons labeled for GABA per surface unit from at least five slices per condition.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nFor all analyses, values from at least three separate experiments were at first tested for normality. Values that followed a normal distribution were compared using Student t-test or one-way ANOVA and Fisher t-tests. Values that did not follow a normal distribution were compared using Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric tests.\n\nAtlas and Nomenclature\n\nThe nomenclature for callosal development is based on the Atlas of the Prenatal Mouse Brain [76]. On the basis of our results, we considered that the CC is divided into two sectors: the medial part is bordered dorsally by the IG and the longitudinal fissure, and ventrally by the GW and the dorsal limit of the septal area. The lateral part comprises the white matter bordered by the CCi superficially, and by the ventricular zone between the GW and the mediodorsal angle of the lateral ventricle towards the ventricular side.\n\nSupporting Information"
