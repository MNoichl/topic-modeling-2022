  "fullText": "There is a typo in Equation 4 of the paper, which is missing the permeability (P) factor. The equation was correct in the code and this typo did not affect the results. However, after noticing this, the authors also discovered a small error in the code, which has now been corrected. This correction does not change the text or conclusions of the paper, though it does have a slight impact on the main and supporting figures. The authors have provided a corrected version of Figs. 1–7, S1–S5 Fig. and the manuscript (S1 Manuscript) here.\n\nSupporting Information"
