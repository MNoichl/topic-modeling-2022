  "abstract": "Mutations that decrease insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and growth hormone signaling\n          limit body size and prolong lifespan in mice. In vertebrates, these somatotropic hormones\n          are controlled by the neuroendocrine brain. Hormone-like regulations discovered in\n          nematodes and flies suggest that IGF signals in the nervous system can determine lifespan,\n          but it is unknown whether this applies to higher organisms. Using conditional mutagenesis\n          in the mouse, we show that brain IGF receptors (IGF-1R) efficiently regulate somatotropic\n          development. Partial inactivation of IGF-1R in the embryonic brain selectively inhibited\n          GH and IGF-I pathways after birth. This caused growth retardation, smaller adult size, and\n          metabolic alterations, and led to delayed mortality and longer mean lifespan. Thus, early\n          changes in neuroendocrine development can durably modify the life trajectory in mammals.\n          The underlying mechanism appears to be an adaptive plasticity of somatotropic functions\n          allowing individuals to decelerate growth and preserve resources, and thereby improve\n          fitness in challenging environments. Our results also suggest that tonic somatotropic\n          signaling entails the risk of shortened lifespan.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nGrowth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) promote mammalian growth\n          [1,2] and contribute to metabolic regulation\n          [3–5]. In contrast, inhibiting the\n        actions of GH or IGF extends lifespan: mice constitutively lacking growth hormone receptor\n        (GHR knockout [6,7]) or GH-releasing hormone\n        receptor (GHRHRlit/lit mutant [8,9]), or mice with fewer IGF receptors [10], no insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)\n          [11], or diminished\n        IRS2 [12] live\n        longer. This powerful effect of insulin-like signals on longevity was discovered in\n        nematodes [13,14] and insects [15,16], but may extend to humans: functionally\n        relevant IGF receptor (IGF-1R) mutations have recently been discovered in centenarians\n          [17], and\n        conditions of low IGF-I, PI3K, IRS1, GH, and GHRH correlate with prolonged lifespan\n          [18,19]. Significantly, the regulation of aging in\n        diverse species involves common major hormonal pathways, and the underlying mechanisms have\n        clearly been conserved through evolution. Several lines of evidence suggest that the\n        fundamental biological process might be an adaptive mechanism enabling individuals to adjust\n        body size, metabolism, and lifespan to their environment, in particular to the challenging\n        natural fluctuations of resources [20–22].\n        Such an adaptive mechanism would require individual plasticity, especially of the\n        somatotropic hormone axis in response to environmental cues. Because the development of this\n        hormone axis is steered by the central nervous system (CNS) through hypothalamic control of\n        pituitary differentiation [23], it is possible that any somatotropic plasticity would involve the CNS.\n        Indeed, previous work in nematodes and insects showed that insulin-like signals in the\n        nervous system alter survival in a non-cell autonomous manner [24–29], suggesting that neuronal control of aging\n        through insulin-like signals might also be conserved. To test these ideas experimentally in\n        a mammalian model, we genetically manipulated IGF signaling in the mouse brain and explored\n        growth, metabolism, and lifespan in these mutants.\n\nWe found that brain IGF receptors strongly promote the development of the somatotropic\n        function in mice. We show that developmental IGF signaling in the brain selectively\n        determines somatotropic plasticity, regulates GH and IGF-I secretion, and thereby controls\n        growth of peripheral tissues, adult glucose metabolism, and energy storage, as well as\n        survival and mortality.\n\n      Results\n      \n        Brain IGF-1R Regulates Growth Hormone\n        \nTo study the role of IGF signaling in the CNS, we generated mice with heterozygous and\n          homozygous brain-specific IGF-1 receptor knockout mutations\n            (bIGF1RKO+/− and\n            bIGF1RKO−/−) by conditional mutagenesis (Figure 1A and 1B). Mutants and their controls were littermates with\n          identical genetic background, and matings were performed such that the Nestin-Cre\n          transgene was always paternally transmitted (see Methods and Text\n            S1 for breeding and genetic background). Homozygous mutants\n            (bIGF1RKO−/−) have no IGF-1R on CNS neurons or\n          glia. They were microcephalic and developed a complex phenotype involving severe growth\n          retardation, infertility, and abnormal behavior (Figure S1). Though very interesting per se, the\n          homozygous bIGF1RKO−/− mice did not show extended lifespan\n          and their adult plasma IGF-I concentration was significantly higher than control values\n            (Figure S1E and\n            S1G). Thus,\n          homozygous mutants were not a suitable model for healthy longevity, which is generally\n          associated with diminished insulin-like signaling [20,21]. We therefore studied the heterozygous mutants\n            (bIGF1RKO+/−), in which the IGF-1R levels in\n          the CNS are half that in the wild-type (Figure 1C). They were healthy and behaved normally (Figure S2). Their body\n          growth, however, though initially normal, was progressively retarded from 20 d of age\n          onwards (Figure 2A). By age 90 d,\n            bIGF1RKO+/− adults weighed about 90%\n          of controls (males, 30.5 ± 0.6 g, n = 12 versus\n          33.7 ± 0.4 g, −9.6%, n = 19,\n            p &lt; 0.0001; females, 24.1 ± 0.3 g, n\n          = 18 versus 26.2 ± 0.5 g, −7.9%,\n          n = 14, p &lt; 0.001) and were\n          5% shorter than controls (p &lt; 0.001) (Table S1).\n            bIGF1RKO+/− mice had normal IGF-1R levels in\n          peripheral tissues (see Figure 1C), so\n          we speculated that endocrine growth regulation during development was disturbed.\n            bIGF1RKO+/− pituitaries were indeed small from\n          age 10 d onwards (Figure 2B), and\n          total GH content remained low throughout development (Figure 2C). The GH concentration per milligram protein\n          fell at age 20 d, suggesting that retardation of early postnatal somatotroph\n          differentiation (Figure 2D) started\n          between day 10 and day 20. Plasma IGF-I, which strongly depends on GH, did not show any\n          pubertal increase in bIGF1RKO+/− mice while\n          controls displayed the normal surge (Figure\n          2E). Moreover, the concentration of the acid labile subunit (ALS), an important\n          regulator of IGF-I stability and itself regulated by GH, was very low in mutants\n          throughout postnatal life (Figure 2F).\n          Importantly, in this model the IGF-1R gene is knocked out in the hypothalamus but not in\n          the pituitary (Figure 3A). Therefore,\n          we suspected that this somatotropic phenotype was caused by alterations in GH-regulatory\n          neurons of the hypothalamus, i.e. arcuate nucleus GHRH neurons and anterior\n          periventricular somatostatin (SRIH) neurons whose endings converge on the external layer\n          of the median eminence (ME). Indeed, hypothalamic GHRH expression in\n            bIGF1RKO+/− mice was significantly low, and GHRH\n          accumulation in the GHRH neuron endings was clearly diminished around age 10 d (Figure 3B and 3C). In contrast, hypophysiotropic SRIH-producing neurons\n          in the hypothalamus exhibited a normal abundance of SRIH at age 10 d, evidence of the\n          cell-specificity of this phenotype (Figure\n          3B and 3D). Accordingly, Pit-1\n          expression, which is controlled by GHRH neurons and steers somatotropic cell\n          differentiation, was half normal in mutant pituitaries (Figure 3E).\n\nThis early somatotropic deficiency persisted: in adult\n            bIGF1RKO+/− hypothalamus, the GHRH concentration\n          remained low, while the abundance of antagonistic SRIH increased (Figure 4A). Consistent with these observations, adult\n            bIGF1RKO+/− pituitaries were small (males,\n          −40%; females, −33%; p &lt;\n          0.001; Table S1),\n          contained many fewer GH-producing cells, and were GH depleted compared with controls\n            (Figure 4A right, 4B). Peripheral tissues showed diverse\n          evidence of chronic lack of GH stimulation: Liver GH receptors were hypersensitive to GH\n          stimulation (Figure 4C), and several\n          markers of peripheral GH action were abnormally low in adults (IGFBP-3,\n          −37%; ALS, −53%; Figure 4D; serine protease inhibitor Spi2.1,\n          −53%, unpublished data). As expected, plasma IGF-I levels were lower\n          in adult bIGF1RKO+/− mice than controls (males, 243\n          ± 10 versus 453 ± 15 ng/ml, −46%,\n          p &lt; 0.0001; females, 321 ± 13 versus 442 ±\n          16 ng/ml, −27%, p &lt; 0.0001) (Figure 4D, right). Finally, IGF-1R was\n          consistently underphosphorylated in major peripheral tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle:\n          between 51% and 67% of control levels, depending on age, as\n          determined by IGF-1R immunoprecipitation and western immunoblot; Figure S3), clearly\n          indicating that cells were receiving less than wild-type IGF-I stimulation.\n\n        Gonado- and Thyrotropic Functions Are Preserved\n        \nTo determine whether the observed hypothalamic inhibition of endocrine GH and IGF-I was\n          specific, we assessed gonado- and thyrotropic functions in mutant animals by monitoring\n          fertility, reproduction, and energy metabolism. bIGF1RKO+/−\n          females were fertile and had normal litters (7.1 ± 0.7 pups, n\n          = 6 litters). Ovarian cycling, controlled by anterior pituitary\n          follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and their hypothalamic\n          releasing hormones, was identical in bIGF1RKO+/− and control\n          females (mean estrous cycle length, at 4 mo of age, 5.1 ± 0.3 versus 4.9\n          ± 0.3 d, n = 15, not significant\n          [NS]; at ∼9 mo of age, 5.3 ± 0.2 versus 5.9\n          ± 0.4 d, n = 37, NS). Moreover, there was no\n          difference in pro-estrus estradiol concentration in adult females (82.3 ± 6.3\n          versus 85.2 ± 5.0 pmol/l, n = 39, NS) nor in ovary\n          size relative to weight (bIGF1RKO+/− 0.36 ± 0.01\n          versus controls 0.38 ± 0.02 mg/g, n = 72, NS);\n          therefore we considered gonadotropic function to be normal. Plasma thyroxin (T4) levels,\n          controlled by pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were unaffected in females\n            (bIGF1RKO+/− 29.1 ± 1.4, n\n          = 19 versus controls 27.5 ± 1.6 μg/l, n\n          = 12, NS) and, although they were moderately high in males\n            (bIGF1RKO+/− 39.0 ± 2.0, n\n          = 14 versus controls 30.0 ± 1.0 μg/l, n\n          = 20, p &lt; 0.005), we observed no differences in core\n          body temperature (males, bIGF1RKO+/− 36.7 ± 0.3\n          °C versus controls 37.0 ± 0.4 °C, n\n          = 15, NS; females, bIGF1RKO+/− 37.4 ±\n          0.1 °C versus controls 37.5 ± 0.1 °C, n\n          = 21, NS), nor did we find abnormalities in physical activity or food\n          consumption (Figure\n          S2A and S2B). Hence, we concluded that thyrotropic function also was in the normal range.\n          In addition, the development of gonado- and thyrotropic phenotypes between 4 and 9 mo of\n          age did not suggest that these functions differed thereafter.\n\n        Energy Storage Is Altered in bIGF1RKO+/− Mice\n        \nWeight gain with age was slightly greater for adult\n          bIGF1RKO+/− mice than for controls (unpublished data), such\n          that female mutants finally attained the same weight as controls. We analyzed body\n          composition in 10-mo-old animals, and as suggested by growth curves and circulating IGF-I\n          levels, most organs in bIGF1RKO+/− mice were\n          smaller than those in controls (Table S1). Adipose tissue (AT), in contrast, was\n          significantly enlarged in males and females (Figure 5A; Table S2). In both sexes, the largest increase was in subcutaneous AT, whereas\n          visceral AT was less increased in mutant females, and even slightly diminished in males,\n          similar to other GH-deficient mouse models [30–32]. Accordingly, circulating leptin levels were\n          excessive in bIGF1RKO+/− mice (males, 27.1 ± 3.6\n          ng/ml versus 7.4 ± 1.2 ng/ml; females, 15.5 ± 1.0 ng/ml versus 6.5\n          ± 0.5 ng/ml; both p &lt; 0.0001; Figure 5B). At age 4 mo, blood biochemistry in\n            bIGF1RKO+/− mice was still normal (Table S3), but at 10\n          mo, HDL and total cholesterol concentrations were high (unpublished data) and triglyceride\n          (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in males significantly higher than in\n          controls, probably due to the abundance of AT (TG, 1.36 ± 0.12 mmol/l versus\n          1.03 ± 0.09 mmol/l, n = 10 per group,\n          p &lt; 0.05; FFA, 0.65 ± 0.04 mmol/l versus 0.48\n          ± 0.03 mmol/l, n = 10 per group, p\n          &lt; 0.005). As circulating GH counteracts fat storage, these metabolic traits may be\n          secondary to the observed somatotropic defect.\n\nMice with peripheral resistance to IGF-I or with low GH and IGF-I activity generally\n          display altered glucose metabolism [3,10,33,34]. We therefore assessed glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in\n          adult bIGF1RKO+/− mice and found moderate, but significant\n          hyperglycemic responses in males and females (Figure 5C). Moreover, although insulin secretory response 30 min after glucose\n          injection appeared adequate in bIGF1RKO+/− females, it was\n          relatively insufficient in bIGF1RKO+/− males (Figure 5D). The impaired control of\n          glucose homeostasis and enlarged fat tissue in adult mutants indicate that the lack of\n          IGF-I and GH progressively affected bIGF1RKO+/−\n        metabolism.\n\n        bIGF1RKO+/− Mice Live Longer Than Controls\n        \nConstitutive inactivation of GHRH or GH receptors, as well as mutations impeding\n          pituitary somatotroph development, increase longevity [6,9,35]. We\n          therefore measured the lifespan of bIGF1RKO+/− and control\n          mice. Survival curves showed that bIGF1RKO+/− mice had a\n          significantly longer mean lifespan than control littermates (914 ± 21 d,\n            n = 27 versus 836 ± 28 d, n\n          = 42, p &lt; 0.05) (Figure 6A). When we analyzed male and female mutants\n          separately, we found similar increases in longevity (Figure 6B and 6C). However, the maximum life span was unchanged. The\n          mortality rate for bIGF1RKO+/− mice up to 100 wk of\n          age was six times lower than for controls\n          (bIGF1RKO+/− 0.037 versus controls 0.238,\n          p &lt; 0.05). Thereafter, however, mortality rate of\n            bIGF1RKO+/− increased sharply and was\n          55% higher for 121- to 140-wk-old\n          bIGF1RKO+/− mice than controls in the same age\n          range. Consequently, the inter-individual variation of lifespan was significantly lower\n          for bIGF1RKO+/− mice than for controls (Figure S4). Thus,\n          survival and mortality patterns in bIGF1RKO+/− mice\n          under normal conditions were clearly affected. In contrast, we did not find differences in\n          survival when mutants where challenged with acute oxidative stress (Figure S5), indicating\n          that causes other than stress resistance were important for increased lifespan of\n            bIGF1RKO+/− mice.\n\nPost-mortem histopathology revealed a similarly diverse, heterogeneous panel of diseases\n          in bIGF1RKO+/− and control mice. To allow statistical\n          evaluation despite relatively few observations, we categorized pathologies as\n          inflammatory, degenerative, or tumor-related. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases was\n          similar (bIGF1RKO+/− 28% versus control mice\n          30%), but bIGF1RKO+/− mice tended to develop\n          fewer degenerative diseases (22% versus 27%, NS) and fewer tumors\n          (44% versus 53%, NS). Notably, none of the\n            bIGF1RKO+/− animals over 130 wk of age showed pituitary\n          tumors or hyperplasia, whereas 20% of the controls did, most probably a\n          consequence of lifelong GHRH stimulation. However, as control animals had a fully normal\n          lifespan, pituitary pathology was apparently not precipitating death. It was more likely\n          that the reduced somatotropic tone in mutant mice protected them from death at an age by\n          which a significant proportion of controls had already died. Concerning the prevalence of\n          pathologies among those controls that die earlier than\n          bIGF1RKO+/−, our data were nonconclusive, essentially due to\n          the limited number of observations. Similarly, we could not find published information on\n          early pathogenesis in B6/129 F1 hybrids. Finally, fewer\n            bIGF1RKO+/− individuals than controls presented multiple\n          pathologies at death (17% versus 47%, p\n          = 0.2), consistent with a lower disease burden in mutants.\n\n      Discussion\n      \n        IGF and Somatotropic Plasticity\n        \nWe showed that diminishing IGF-1R expression in the brain selectively reduced\n          somatotropic function. This result suggests that brain IGF-1R controls the set-up of the\n          GH/IGF axis, thereby modulating growth, energy metabolism, and lifespan. In contrast,\n          complete absence of brain IGF-1R in the homozygous knockout produced a very different\n          phenotype leading to increased IGF-I; thus, the phenotype is strongly dependent on IGF-1R\n          gene dose. Any life-prolonging effects of early growth retardation in the homozygous\n          mutant were subsequently suppressed, possibly by increased IGF-I. However, phenotypic\n          alterations in the homozygote were so complex that comparing them with the heterozygote\n          seemed a futile endeavor. Interestingly, brain-specific inactivation of IRS2, a major\n          signal transduction molecule downstream from IGF-1R and insulin receptors, increased\n          lifespan and altered nutrient homeostasis [12], while apparently not involving the\n          somatotropic axis.\n\nThe heterozygous bIGF1RKO+/− phenotype was\n          somatotroph-specific and other neuroendocrine pathways were unaffected, implicating\n          hypothalamic GHRH neurons. IGF receptors are indeed present in the arcuate nucleus where\n          GHRH neurons reside. There is, however, little evidence for a specific developmental role\n          for IGF-I in the regulation of GHRH neurons, and we cannot exclude the possibility that\n          IGF-1R deletion from other brain areas affected GHRH neurons at a distance. Nevertheless,\n          the similitude of bIGF1RKO+/− mice with mutants lacking GHRH\n          neurons [36] or\n          GHRH receptors [9]\n          also indicated that this phenotype could have been caused by reduced GHRH signals to the\n          pituitary. Importantly, the number of GH-producing cells in\n            bIGF1RKO+/− pituitaries was only a fraction of that in\n          controls. This finding was corroborated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and concordant with\n          the several-fold reduced pituitary GH content. GH depletion, in turn, explains the very\n          low ALS concentration and absence of the pubertal surge in IGF-I. As the reduction in GHRH\n          was proportionate to hypothalamic IGF-1R dose, GHRH action presumably triggers a\n          disproportionate loss of GH cells. Several mechanisms may contribute to this: GHRH\n          regulates the number of GH-positive cells, as well as GH production and secretion. Most\n          likely, GHRH abundance must be above a certain threshold to stimulate\n          hypothalamic-pituitary development and GH production. Moreover, not only GHRH but also\n          SRIH neurons, which determine adult GH secretion, may be sensitive to IGF. SRIH was indeed\n          above control concentrations in the adult bIGF1RKO+/−\n          hypothalamus, suggesting that coordinate GHRH and SRIH action on somatotrophs may have\n          contributed to the observed over-proportionate effects.\n\nGHRH and SRIH accumulate in nerve endings at the ME, and are liberated into portal veins\n          to regulate pituitary GH. During development, somatotroph proliferation and\n          differentiation depend on local GHRH. In bIGF1RKO+/−\n          hypothalamus, immunoreactive GHRH but not SRIH was less abundant than in controls. This\n          difference in amount suggests a shift from GHRH to SRIH stimulation at the ME and has\n          possible functional implications for pituitary development, e.g. via Pit-1. Early lack of\n          GHRH in ME, as observed here, may be due to less GHRH neurons, fewer nerve endings, or\n          diminished GHRH. Although we cannot conclude from our experiments, IGF receptors in the ME\n          of adult bIGF1RKO+/− appeared to be less phosphorylated than\n          those in the rest of the hypothalamus (38.8 ± 2.6 versus 59.0 ± 4.9,\n          arbitrary units, p = 0.005, n = 8;\n          no difference in control mice; Figure S3B). Thus, ME may participate in somatotropic\n          control, for instance by sensing circulating IGF-I. The ME also harbors numerous\n          tanycytes, glia specialized in IGF-I transport to the brain, that may contribute to the\n          modulation of somatotropic signals by acting on the maturation of GHRH neurons. Our\n          various findings combine to indicate that IGF-I, the principal peripheral mediator of GH\n          action, itself plays a major role in the development of the GH/IGF axis.\n\nCells in small organisms communicate trophic status via paracrine insulin-like signals\n            [37]. Our results\n          suggest that IGF-I may have conserved a role of this type in complex organisms and act, in\n          particular, during development as a trophic signal that represents numerous, distant\n          tissues [38]. The\n          neuroendocrine network of GHRH, SRIH, and GH cells evolved in vertebrates as a central\n          regulator that coordinates growth of heterogeneous cell populations. Here, we describe a\n          mechanism that determines the individual postnatal trajectory of the somatotropic axis and\n          its adult set point. Somatotropic plasticity, as we observed here, may have evolved to\n          adjust growth to environmental resources. We further demonstrated that early dietary\n          restriction can trigger a neuroendocrine response similar to brain-specific IGF-1R\n          knockout (see Text\n          S1, Supplementary Results and Figure S6). Both genetic and nutritional intervention\n          led to growth deficits and a lifelong reduction in endocrine IGF-I. Thus, it appears that\n          a fairly direct hormonal path connects nutrition, somatotropic hormones and growth through\n          a positive feedback (Figure S7). This view is supported by recent evidence that AT, a major indicator\n          of postnatal nutrition, is an important source of IGF-I [39]. Also, the phylogenetically related insulin\n          receptor (IR) on pancreatic β-cells controls development of the insulin/IR\n          hormone axis in a very similar manner [3,4].\n\nHeterozygous inactivation of brain IGF-1R led to a consistent somatotropic deficit, but\n          without any detectable effects on other brain functions. Interestingly, we found that in\n          the bIGF1RKO+/− brain, the remaining IGF receptors were\n          overphosphorylated in the cerebral cortex (120% ± 5% of\n          controls, n = 16, p &lt; 0.05; Figure S3A) but not in\n          hypothalamus. This cortical IGF-1R activation may be due to a compensatory local increase\n          of ligand. In contrast, complete absence of IGF-1R in\n          bIGF1RKO−/− mutants (Figure S1) resulted in\n          microcephaly, indicative of a neurotrophic role for IGF-1R. We conclude that the IGF-1R\n          gene is heterosufficient with respect to neurotrophic action, but heteroinsufficient with\n          regard to its role in regulating somatotropic plasticity.\n\nWe showed that downregulation of somatotropic hormones postponed mortality and increased\n          mean lifespan. The underlying developmental mechanism suggested that neuroendocrine\n          control of lifespan may be physiologically relevant in mammals. Indeed, somatotropic\n          plasticity may confer an evolutionary advantage: adaptation of individual body size to\n          available resources would improve fitness in the face of environmental changes; control of\n          size, energy metabolism, and lifespan contribute to preserving vital resources and to\n          maintaining genetic diversity during periods of shortage. Therefore, the evolutionary\n          significance of somatotropic plasticity may be that it cushions otherwise deleterious\n          effects of selective pressure.\n\nThe Barker hypothesis and predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis claim that\n          changes in development can have late consequences for health, modify mortality and\n          lifespan, and entail a risk of maladaptation later in life, if environmental conditions\n          differ grossly from those that led to the initial changes [40,41]. This may apply to bIGF1RKO+/− mice,\n          adapted to a poor environment (little IGF signaling to the brain), when food was available\n          ad libitum. The resulting dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in\n            bIGF1RKO+/− mutants may explain the rapid increase in\n          late-life mortality and unusual combination of extended mean but normal maximum lifespan.\n          Similar patterns of survival have been described in other aging models: in Caenorhabditis elegans, ablation of ASI\n          sensory neurons that modulate DAF-2 pathways in response to environment, increased mean,\n          but not maximum lifespan [27]; in Drosophila, targeted expression of human\n          uncoupling protein 2 in adult neurons [42], or inhibition of p53 specifically in the\n          nervous system [43], extended mean, but not maximum, lifespan. Common to these models is\n          that the mutations were targeted to the nervous system, and it is possible that the\n          perturbed neuronal responsiveness to environmental cues is the primary cause of prolonged\n          lifespan in these models.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of our findings with\n          bIGF1RKO+/− mice is possible. The average lifespan of the\n          mutants was longer than controls, but its variability was half than that for controls.\n          Thus, individuals on the short-lived edge of the normal lifespan distribution (see Figures 6 and S4) benefit most from\n          reduced growth hormone and IGF-I: they respond with a lifespan extension of nearly\n          40%. This finding raises the question of why genetically homogeneous wild-type\n          populations display large variability in lifespan. A current explanation is that initially\n          small stochastic differences between individuals are subsequently amplified during\n          development and adult life; however, the mechanism for this remains unclear. Our data\n          indicate that a full complement of brain IGF-1R is required for generating a high\n          somatotropic tone, and this eventually increases the risk of dying early. This mechanism\n          may produce much of the lifespan heterogeneity observed in wild-type mice. Remarkably, the\n          variability of plasma GH was several-fold higher in controls than in\n            bIGF1RKO+/− mice, the mutants having continuously low GH\n          levels (M. Holzenberger, L. Kappeler, and A. Bekaert, unpublished data). There are indeed\n          other mammalian species where short lifespan can be related to elevated somatotropic\n          signaling, and vice-versa. In dogs, small size and low IGF-I are determined by one\n          particular IGF-I allele [44], and small breeds live twice as long as large breeds [45]. Van Heemst et al.\n            [19] investigated\n          the relationship between somatotropic function, adult height, and longevity in humans, and\n          found that in women, genetically determined low GH and IGF-I signaling was beneficial for\n          old age survival. Recently, functionally relevant IGF-1R mutations were isolated from\n          human centenarians [17]. Persisting high GH in acromegalic patients after surgical treatment\n          is predictive of premature death [46], and elevated IGF-I in elderly individuals correlates with\n          increased mortality [47]. Furthermore, the average lifespan of people with pituitary gigantism\n          (mean height 236 cm, n = 28) is only 44 y, roughly 20 y below\n          the corresponding historical adult life expectancy. It would be extremely valuable to\n          measure the consequences of somatotropic tone for human health and longevity in a variety\n          of contexts to clarify these important issues.\n\n      Methods\n      \n        Mouse genetics.\n        \nIgf1rflox mice [48,49] were maintained in a 129/Sv (129) genetic background and also\n          backcrossed to C57BL/6 (B6) for &gt;15 generations. The Nestin-Cre\n          (NesCre) transgene (maintained in B6 for &gt;15 generations) produces\n          Cre recombinase in neural and glial precursors during early neural development\n            [50]. By mating\n              Igf1rflox/+ females (B6) with\n              NesCre+/0 males we generated\n              Igf1rflox/+;NesCre+/0 double\n          mutants in a B6 background. These were mated with\n          Igf1rflox/flox females (129) to produce experimental cohorts\n          as fully reproducible F1 generations of B6/129 hybrid genetic background, composed of\n          hetero- (+/−) and homozygous (−/−) brain-specific\n          IGF-1R knockout mice (bIGF1RKO) and their littermate controls. F1 hybrids from pure inbred\n          strains combine two advantages: reproducibility of genetic composition and so-called\n          hybrid vigor, i.e. the absence of phenotypic defects that affect pure inbred strains. F1\n          hybrids are generally long-lived, like mice from mixed genetic backgrounds and some pure\n          inbred strains, including C57BL/6. We conducted experiments according to institutional\n          guidelines for the care of laboratory animals.\n\n        Mice.\n        \nAnimals lived under SPF conditions in individually ventilated cages at 23 °C,\n          with a 14/10-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and a commercial rodent diet\n          (49% carbohydrate, 24% protein, 5% lipid, 12%\n          humidity, 10% mineral, and fiber). Mice were separated from mothers on day 30\n          and housed six males or six females per cage, with both control and mutant genotypes in\n          each cage. Cages were equipped with a mouse house to enhance social interaction and\n          prevent male aggressiveness. We produced four cohorts. In cohort 1 (105\n            bIGF1RKO+/−, 116 control males) we analyzed somatotropic\n          development. To minimize litter effects, they were trimmed to four to six pups per mother.\n          For experiments, mutants and controls were always litter-matched and each group was\n          composed of animals from at least three different litters. In cohort 2 (57\n            bIGF1RKO+/−, 51 controls) we studied growth, metabolism,\n          behavior, hormones, and body composition. In cohort 3 (45\n            bIGF1RKO+/−, 60 controls) we analyzed additional blood\n          variables, female fertility, and ovarian function. Mice of cohort 4 (27\n            bIGF1RKO+/−, 19\n          bIGF1RKO−/−, 42 controls) were checked daily, but otherwise\n          left undisturbed until they died naturally. Single surviving females were housed with\n          neighbors. Necropsy was performed on all animals. Brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and\n          spleen were dissected post mortem and fixed in formalin for histology. We determined major\n          pathologies present at death for 62 of the 88 animals.\n\n        Postnatal growth.\n        \nMice were weighed daily until the age of 6 wk and weekly thereafter. For growth curves,\n          we used sliding means of current weight and weight on the preceding and subsequent day (or\n          week, for age &gt;6 wk).\n\n        Fertility and reproduction.\n        \nEstrous cycle length was determined by daily monitoring of vaginal smear histology for 3\n          to 4 wk. Blood and ovaries were sampled between 11 a.m. and 14 p.m. on the pro-estrus day\n          under pentobarbital anesthesia. Mean litter size was calculated from matings between\n            bIGF1RKO+/− females and wild-type males.\n\n        Body temperature.\n        \nRectal temperature was determined on three consecutive days. Measurement began within 10\n          s of immobilization, to avoid artifacts of stress-induced thermogenesis.\n\n        Histology and immunohistochemistry.\n        \nLacZ staining was performed on parasagittal 14-μm-thick cryosections from 2-wk-old\n          double transgenic\n          NesCre+/0;Rosa26R+/0 mice\n            [33].\n              Rosa26R+/0 littermates served as negative\n          controls. Sections were fixed in PAF, stained with X-Gal overnight and counterstained with\n          orange G. Inguinal fat pads from males were quickly frozen and cryosections (50 μm;\n          −30 °C) fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PAF) for hematoxylin\n          staining. Digital micrographs in visible light were taken with an Olympus BX51 microscope.\n          We detected GH in the pituitary, and GHRH and SRIH in the ME using standard fluorescent\n          IHC. Sections 18 μm thick were fixed in PAF and incubated overnight with rabbit\n          anti-GH (NIH-NIDDK), rabbit anti-GHRH, or goat anti-SRIH antibodies (Santa Cruz).\n          Secondary antibodies were Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488 donkey anti-goat\n          (Molecular Probes). For fluorescent IHC we used an Olympus BX612 microscope. To compare\n          the relative intensities of IHC signals for GH, GHRH, and SRIH between mutants and\n          controls, we processed all samples under identical conditions with respect to anatomical\n          location, antibody incubation, laser intensity, and CCD image acquisition, in particular\n          using identical parameters of signal integration. For each animal, data obtained from ten\n          different tissue sections were averaged. Means were then compared between groups using\n          Student's t-test.\n\n        Western blotting.\n        \nImmunoprecipitation and western blotting were as described previously [51]. Antibodies used were\n          anti-IGF-1R β-subunit (C20, Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-tyrosine (PY20,\n          Transduction Laboratories), anti-mouse GHR (from G. Gudmundur and F. Talamantes), anti-ALS\n          (AF1436, R&amp;D Systems), anti-mouse P-Jak2 Tyr1007/1008 (Cell Signalling/Ozyme),\n          anti-β-tubulin (Oncogene Research), and anti-β-actin (Sigma). We\n          confirmed equal loading for each immunoblot. Bound antibody was revealed using\n          peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signals\n          were quantified using MacBas 2.5 (Fuji) or film autoradiography and NIH Image (for\n        ALS).\n\n        Biochemistry.\n        \nFrom blood samples we determined total bilirubin, HDL, and total cholesterol,\n          triglycerides, creatinine, glucose, lactate, total protein, urea and total antioxidant\n          status, using an Olympus Diagnostic Automat. We tested glucose tolerance in animals fasted\n          for 14 h by intraperitoneal injection of 20%-D-glucose (2 g/kg body weight):\n          glucose was assayed in tail blood at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min using a hand-held\n          photometer (Lifescan Glucotouch); insulinemia was measured at 0 and 30 min. We used RIA to\n          determine plasma IGF-I (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories), insulin, leptin (both from\n          Linco), and T4 (MP Biomedical). Estradiol concentrations were determined by RIA in 150\n          μl of mouse pro-estrus serum (Diasorin). Pituitary GH content was measured using a\n          rat-specific RIA (Linco). GHRH and SRIH were quantified in sonicated hypothalami by RIA\n            [52]. The BCAssay\n          (Uptima UP40840A, Interchim) was used to determine pituitary and hypothalamic protein\n          content.\n\n        GH receptor stimulation.\n        \nHuman recombinant GH (Serono) was injected into the portal vein of mice (0.5 μg/g\n          body weight) under isoflurane anesthesia (Abbott Laboratories). Liver biopsies, taken at\n          the time of injection and 2, 5, and 20 min later were immediately frozen for protein\n          extraction.\n\n        Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR.\n        \nTotal RNA from hypothalami and pituitaries were extracted with phenol-chloroform (RNAble;\n          Eurobio) and aliquots of 1 μg were reverse transcribed (Transcriptor; Roche) using\n          random hexamers (Promega) in the presence of RNAsine (Promega). Duplicates of 10 ng cDNA\n          were used for real-time PCR amplification in an Applied Biosystem's PCR System 7300 and\n          its reagents (GHRH, Mm00439100_m1; SRIH, Mm00436671_m1; NPY, Mm00445771_m1; Pit-1,\n          Mm00476852_m1; GH, Mm00433590_g1; PRL, Mm005599949_m1; TSH-β, Mm00437190_m1;\n          LH-β, Mm00656868_q1; β-actin, 4352933E; 18S rRNA, 4333760F).
