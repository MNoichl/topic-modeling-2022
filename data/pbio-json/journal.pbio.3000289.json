  "abstract": "Gene duplication promotes adaptive evolution in two main ways: allowing one duplicate to evolve a new function and splitting ancestral functions between the duplicates. The second scenario may resolve adaptive conflicts that can rise when one gene performs different functions. In an apparent departure from both scenarios, low-expressing transcription factor (TF) duplicates commonly bind to the same DNA motifs and act in overlapping conditions. To examine for possible benefits of this apparent redundancy, we examined the Msn2 and Msn4 duplicates in budding yeast. We show that Msn2,4 function as one unit by inducing the same set of target genes in overlapping conditions. Yet, the two-factor composition allows this unit’s expression to be both environmentally responsive and with low noise, resolving an adaptive conflict that limits expression of single genes. We propose that duplication can provide adaptive benefit through cooperation rather than functional divergence, allowing two-factor dynamics with beneficial properties that cannot be achieved by a single gene.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nThe number of transcription factors (TFs) expressed in eukaryotes positively correlates with genome size and organism complexity, ranging from approximately 50 in obligate parasites to &gt;1,000 in high eukaryotes [1]. Gene duplication plays a major role in this evolutionary expansion [2,3], as is evident from the fact that the majority of TFs belong to just a few DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) families, and the number of eukaryotic DBD families per species is constant, regardless of the genome size or the number of genes [1]. Understanding the adaptive forces that promote duplication-dependent expansion of TFs is of great interest.\n\nGene duplication can promote evolution by allowing one of the duplicates to adopt a novel function while the second duplicate maintains the ancestral function. More often, however, the two duplicates do not gain a new function but rather lose complementary subsets of ancestral functions [4,5]. In addition to explaining duplicate maintenance, subfunctionalization can promote adaptive evolution by resolving adaptive conflicts [6,7]. Indeed, optimizing a dual-function protein is often constrained by conflicting requirements imposed by the different functions: a mutation that favors one function can perturb the other function, presenting an adaptive conflict that only upon duplication is resolved to allow further optimization.\n\nIn the context of TFs, duplication may allow one factor to acquire a new set of target genes (neofunctionalization). Alternatively, the ancestral targets could split between the duplicates (subfunctionalization). In both scenarios, duplicate divergence would increase and refine the regulatory logic. Previous studies exemplified both scenarios [8–10], but whether they are relevant for the majority of TF duplicates remained unclear.\n\nBudding yeast provide a convenient platform for studying the adaptive roles of TF duplicates. The yeast lineage underwent a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) event about 100 million years ago [11], which was a result of an interspecies hybridization [12]. While most duplicates generated in this event were lost, about 10% were retained, among which TFs are over-represented. Many of the retained TF duplicates show little signs of divergence in their DBD, bind the same DNA motifs (S1 and S2 Figs), and regulate similar cellular functions, suggesting at least partial redundancy.\n\nMsn2 and Msn4 are a case in point. Previous studies established that the two factors induce an overlapping set of environmental stress response genes [13–15] but also suggested some differences in response kinetics of individual targets. We decided to revisit this analysis using the higher experimental resolution now possible to systematically characterize target divergence under a range of conditions. Our results, however, reinforced the conclusion that the two factors regulate the same set of target genes, translocate to the nucleus with the precise same dynamics, and contribute to stress protection.\n\nOur search for differences between the duplicates pointed us to a different aspect of transcription regulation: the challenge cells face when attempting to minimize noise in gene expression. As a stochastic process, transcription is subject to random variations (noise) [16,17]. Noisy expression is deleterious when affecting genes that require precise tuning [18], such as dosage-sensitive genes [19,20], but can become beneficial when enabling processes not possible by deterministic dynamics [21–23]. Accordingly, noise levels vary greatly between genes [24]. Yet, the ability to tune expression noise through changes in gene promoter is limited. In particular, it is well-documented that genes that are readily regulated by environmental signal also show a high level of expression noise [16,25–27]. This observation is rationalized in two main ways. First, a gene that is regulated by a large number of factors, as required for tuning gene expression with environmental signal, will also show corresponding sensitivity to stochastic variations in its regulators. Second, promoter structures allowing for dynamic response are different from those that encode for constant expression and are therefore associated with increasing noise. For example, flexible promoters bind nucleosomes more loosely and uniformly compared to stable promoters, possibly introducing a nonlinear competition between TFs and nucleosomes. Thus, while coding for low-noise expression is possible, it comes at the cost of lowering the dynamic range over which expression can be changed by regulatory signals.\n\nIt was suggested that gene duplication can relieve the coupling between expression noise and plasticity [25]. Our study shows that this is indeed the case for Msn2,4. Following duplication, Msn2 expression became highly stable. It now shows limited responsiveness to environmental conditions and is subject to low expression noise. By contrast, Msn4 expression accentuated the environmental-responsive expression of the unduplicated homolog. This resulted in an overall expression of the Msn2,4 unit that is responsive to the environment yet at the same time maintains low noise expression at the basal, uninduced state. We provide evidence that this expression tuning is phenotypically adaptive and define the genetic changes that correlates with the change in gene responsiveness and noise. Our results suggest that duplicates can promote adaptive evolution not only through functional divergence, as suggested by the neo- or subfunctionalization models, but also through effective cooperation. Through cooperation, the functional unit adopts two-factor dynamics with emergence beneficial properties that cannot be achieved using a single gene.\n\nResults\n\nLow-noise Poisson distribution of MSN2 expression in individual cells\n\nMsn2 and Msn4 are TF duplicates that regulate the stress response in budding yeast [13,28]. Stress genes show a noisy expression [29], and we were therefore surprised to observe that Msn2 is expressed at very similar amounts across individual cells. In fact, of the 250 genes with the closest mean abundance to Msn2, only one was less noisy, as quantified in a study surveying &gt;2,500 GFP-fused proteins [24] (Fig 1A). Using single-molecule Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) [30], we found that the number of MSN2 transcripts in individual cells is well-described by a Poisson distribution, as expected when individual mRNA transcripts are produced and degraded at constant rates [29,31] (Fig 1B and S3 Fig). This distribution represents the lower limit of gene expression noise, obtained in the absence of regulation or other noise-amplifying processes [31].\n\nIncreasing Msn2 expression promotes stress protection but reduces cell growth rate\n\nLow expression noise characterizes genes coding for essential functions or components of large complexes [29,33], for which expression tuning is beneficial [33–35]. By contrast, Msn2 is not essential, does not participate in large complexes, and is mostly inactive in rich media. To examine whether and how Msn2 expression level impacts cell fitness, we engineered a library of strains expressing Msn2 at gradually increasing amounts using synthetic promoters [32]. This library was generated on an MSN4-deletion background to eliminate possible compensation effects by Msn4. Measuring growth rates of the library strains using a sensitive competition assay (Fig 1C), we found that decreasing Msn2 expression to below its wild-type levels and down to a complete deletion had no detectable effect on growth rate within the resolution of our assay (0.5%). By contrast, growth rate decreased upon increasing Msn2 abundance (Fig 1D and S4 Fig). Next, we tested the effect of Msn2 levels on the ability to proliferate in harsh stress by incubating the library cells in high H2O2 concentrations (Fig 1E and S4 Fig). Here, increasing Msn2 levels was beneficial: cells that expressed high levels of Msn2 resumed growth faster than low-expressing ones. Therefore, increasing Msn2 expression better protects cells against stress but reduces their growth rate. An optimal Msn2 level is therefore desirable to balance the need for rapid growth and stress protection, explaining the requirement for low-noise tuning of its gene expression.\n\nTo measure directly the phenotypic effect of noisier Msn2, we selected six promoters that are expressed at similar levels to Msn2 but show a higher expression noise and swapped the endogenous MSN2 promoter with these selected promoters. We swapped the promoters on a background strain with MSN4 deletion and Msn2-YFP tag, allowing us to measure the mean and noise expression of Msn2 by flow cytometer. We measured growth rates of these strains using a sensitive competition assay (Fig 1F) and found that four of the noisy promoters decreased the growth rate to below its wild-type levels. Next, we tested the effect of the noise on the ability to proliferate in harsh stress by incubating the cells in high H2O2 concentrations (Fig 1G). We found that as Msn2 expression noise increases, the cells resumed growth more slowly. We therefore concluded that low-noise tuning in Msn2 expression is adaptive and beneficial.\n\nMSN4 expression is environmentally sensitive and high-noise\n\nThe tradeoff between rapid growth and stress preparation depends on their relative contribution to population fitness, which is a function of growth conditions. For example, when growth conditions are optimal, maximizing division rate dominates, but when nutrients become limiting, protecting against stress becomes increasingly important. Consistent with this, as cells approached stationary phase, they became better protected and resumed growth faster following H2O2 exposure (Fig 2A).\n\nIf Msn2 expression is evolutionarily optimized to account for both rapid growth and stress protection, its expression should be changed in conditions that modify their relative contribution to fitness. We therefore expected Msn2 expression to change, for example, along the growth curve, increasing as cells approach stationary phase. This, however, was not the case. Although Msn2 contributed to stress protection at all densities, its expression remained constant throughout the growth curve (Fig 2B).\n\nMsn4, the Msn2 duplicate, is also a stress genes activator [14,28]. Msn4-GFP was undetectable in reported measurements [36,37], suggesting that its expression level is low during rapid growth. We reasoned that Msn4 expression might increase along the growth curve to account for the changing interplay and promoter stress protection. This was indeed the case: Msn4 expression increased with cell density (Fig 2B). This higher expression was accompanied by increased contribution to stress protection, as was measured by introducing H2O2 to strains with MSN2 deletion in different cell densities (Fig 2A). Consistent with the control–noise tradeoff described above, this dynamic regulation of MSN4 was accompanied by high expression noise, which significantly exceeded the Poissonian variance (Fig 2C).\n\nMsn2 and Msn4 colocalize to the nucleus with the same dynamics in individual cells\n\nOur results above show that Msn2 and Msn4 contribute additively to stress protection, and we further verified this by replacing each of these proteins by its paralog (S7 Fig). This additive contribution could result from regulation of the same set of genes or through induction of a distinct set of targets. Similarly, it could respond to the same or to different sets of post-translational factors. Since activated Msn2,4 translocate to the nucleus [38,39], we defined their activation pattern by following their nuclear translocation dynamics using fluorescent-tagged proteins (Fig 3A). In response to osmotic stress, the two factors translocated to the nucleus within minutes, showing precisely the same kinetics within individual cells (Fig 3B and 3C, yellow shade, and S8 Fig). Similarly, translocation of the two proteins also remained highly synchronized within individual cells during the stochastic pulsing following stress [39,40] (Fig 3C, pink shade). Deletion of MSN2 did not affect the dynamics of its duplicate Msn4 (S9 Fig).\n\nMsn2 and Msn4 induce the same set of target genes\n\nNext, we examined for differences in Msn2,4 target genes using time-resolved, genome-wide transcription profiling of cells subject to a variety of stresses. In rapidly growing cells, deletion of MSN2 strongly reduced stress gene induction, while deletion of MSN4 had little, if any, effect (Fig 3D and S11 Fig). Swapping the MSN2,4 promoters completely reversed the target induction capacity of these factors (Fig 3E and S12B Fig). The identity of the targets remained the same: Msn4 driven by the MSN2 promoter induced precisely the same targets normally induced by Msn2. The induction of the targets was almost as high as the induction of Msn2, suggesting that most of this effect is governed by the promoter and some minor effect by the induction capacity of Msn4. When tested in conditions in which Msn4 is highly expressed, the two factors induced the same set of genes (Fig 3F and S12 Fig). Since a previous study [41] that followed stress induction of individual genes using fluorescence reporters indicated some differences in individual targets dependence on Msn2,4, we examined specifically the genes reported to be differently regulated. However, none of these genes showed any difference in their Msn2,4 dependency in any of the six conditions for which we performed tight time-course measurements (S13 Fig). While some of the reported differences may be due to strain or condition differences, we attribute them mostly to differences in the resolution of our measurements (see S1 Note for discussion).\n\nTo further corroborate these results, we used Chromatin Endogenous Cleavage sequencing ChEC-seq) [42] to measure the genome-wide binding profiles of Msn2,4. The binding profiles of the two factors were indistinguishable (S14 Fig). This identity of Msn2,4 targets is consistent with the high conservation of their DNA binding domains (Fig 3G), and identity of their in vitro DNA binding preferences[43] (S15 Fig). We conclude that Msn2,4 proteins are co-regulated by the same signals and, at the same kinetics, activate the same set of target genes with the same kinetics, essentially functioning as one TF.\n\nDifferential architecture of the MSN2,4 promoters explains the differences in their expression flexibility and noise\n\nMsn2 expression is stable along the growth curve, while Msn4 is strongly induced. To examine whether this differential dynamics is specific to these conditions or is a more general property of the two genes, we surveyed a data set composed of thousands of transcription profiles [13,44,45]. Expression of MSN2 showed little variability in all reported conditions, while MSN4 was variable (Fig 4A and 4B). Expression of MSN2 and MSN4 therefore conforms to the general tradeoff between expression noise and regulatory control: Msn2 is stable across conditions and shows low cell-to-cell variability (noise), while Msn4 expression readily responds to environmental signals and is noisy.\n\nPrevious studies defined promoter types that encode for flexible and noisy or stable and low-noise expression [51–53]. Flexible promoters tend to contain a TATA box and bind nucleosomes immediately upstream to their Transcription Start Site (TSS), while stable promoters lack a TATA box and display a Nucleosome-Free Region (NFR) upstream of their TSS. Consistent with their differential flexibility, we find that the MSN4 promoter contains a TATA box, binds nucleosomes around its TSS, and includes a large number of TF binding sites. By contrast, the MSN2 promoter does not contain a TATA box, displays an NFR immediately upstream of the TSS, and is largely devoid of TF binding sites (Fig 4C; data from [46–48]).\n\nWhen aligned by their coding frames, the nucleosome patterns along the upstream regions of MSN2 and MSN4 promoters are highly similar. However, the location of the TSS is different: in MSN4, the TSS is positioned approximately 105 bp away in a region that is nucleosome occupied, while in MSN2, the TSS is significantly further upstream and located on the border of an NFR. The resulting 5′ UTR of MSN2 is exceptionally long (approximately 430 bp in length; longer 5′ UTRs are found in only 2% of S. cerevisiae genes; data from [47]).\n\nTo examine whether the differential architectures of the MSN2,4 promoters are indeed responsible for their differential expression flexibilities, we first checked whether the region regulating MSN4 expression is the NFR region, predicted to bind multiple TFs. This was indeed the case because deleting this region practically abolished Msn4 induction along the growth curve (S16 Fig). Furthermore, replacing this region in the MSN4 promoter with the corresponding region from MSN2 promoter, which includes an NFR and the MSN2 TSS, increased MSN4 expression and reduced its noise (S17 Fig). Therefore, as predicted, this promoter region accounts for the differential expression characteristics of MSN2 and MSN4.\n\nMSN2 TSS was shifted following the WGD event\n\nMsn2,4 were generated in the WGD event approximately 100 million years ago [11], which was a result of an interspecies hybridization [12], and were retained in all WGD species tracing to this event. To examine whether the differential promoter structure of MSN2,4 is conserved in other WGD species, we used available 5′ RNA data [49] and further profiled TSS positioning in these species. The TSS positions of the MSN2 and MSN4 homologs were conserved in all post-WGD species (Fig 4D). Sequence analysis indicated that also the TATA box was conserved in all MSN4 homologs but absent from all MSN2 homologs (Fig 4D). We next profiled 5′ RNA in two non-WGD species. The transcript of the single MSN homolog has a short 5′ UTR, similar to that of MSN4. This pattern of conservation is consistent with a scenario in which the stable MSN2 promoter evolved from an ancestral flexible promoter through a shift in the TSS to a distant, TATA-lacking position at the boundary of a nearby NFR.\n\nMSN4 accentuated the environmentally responsive but noisy expression of the non-WGD homolog while MSN2 gained a stable, low-noise expression\n\nTo examine whether the differential expression flexibility of MSN2,4 is also conserved in the other post-WGD species, we used available expression data [50] of 13 yeast species along their growth curves. In all post-WGD species, MSN4 expression increased along the growth curve while MSN2 expression remained stable (Fig 4E). The single MSN homolog in the non-WGD species showed a moderate induction along the growth curve, with a dynamic range that was larger than that of MSN2 but lower than that of MSN4 (Fig 4E).\n\nTo examine whether this intermediate regulation is also reflected in the expression noise of these proteins, we introduced the MSN promoter from K. lactis, a non-WGD species, into S. cerevisiae upstream of the MSN2 ORF and measured expression noise using smFISH. As predicted, this promoter showed an intermediate noise level that was higher than MSN4 but lower than MSN2 (Fig 4F). In fact, when plotted on the noise–control curve, the three promoters all fell on the same line, consistent with same-proportion change in noise and dynamic range of regulated expression. Therefore, our analysis suggests that MSN2 gained its stable, low-noise expression following the duplication event, likely by shifting its TSS, while MSN4 accentuated the regulated expression of the ancestral factor, likely through the acquisition of new binding sites for TFs, increasing its dynamic range and expression noise.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTaken together, we find that Msn2,4 function as one unit to regulate stress response genes. The two paralogs are translocated to the nucleus with the same kinetics, bind and regulate the same set of target genes, and contribute additively to stress protection. Consistent with previous studies [15,54], we also observe a more severe phenotype of Msn2 deletion when stressing rapidly growing cells, but we now show that this results from the low expression of Msn4 under these conditions and not from a differential function.\n\nWhat limits replacement of Msn2,4, in at least some species, by a single factor of a more refined transcriptional control? Our data show that Msn2,4 function as one unit whose expression is both environmentally responsive and low-noise (Fig 4G), thereby resolving an inherent conflict that limits the tuning of individual gene expression. Msn2 provides the low-noise basal expression, whereas Msn4 is induced when additional amounts are needed. It is difficult to predict the evolutionary forces that promoted the evolution of Msn2,4 expression features, but since the Msn duplication traces to the WGD event, it is tempting to propose that its new expression characteristics were driven by the shift in metabolism: rapidly growing non-WGD species respire, while WGD species ferment. Following this metabolic change, genes needed in respiring cells may shift from being constitutively expressed to being Msn-dependent, as was indeed reported [55]. We propose that changes in the identity of Msn2,4-dependent genes accentuated its phenotypic effects on growth and drove selection for increased precision of Msn2 expression.\n\nGene duplication is a major source of evolutionary innovation [4,5] that greatly contributes to the expansion of transcription networks [2,3]. A surprisingly large fraction of TF duplicates, however, retained a conserved DBD and bind to the same DNA motif (S1 and S2 Figs). Whether these duplicates bind and regulate the same set of targets is not known, but the case of Msn2,4 suggests that at least a fraction of them do. Such an apparent redundancy does not comply with the accepted models of neo- or subfunctionalization explaining duplicate advantage. Our study supports a third model whereby duplicates with redundant biochemical properties realize dynamic properties that are not possible or are difficult to achieve using a single factor. In the case of Msn2,4, duplication resolved a conflict between regulatory control and noise. In fact, duplicated genes were reported previously to show higher regulatory plasticity and to gain more TATA boxes since the WGD event as compared to singletons[25]. This suggests an additional case of a relief of the noise–control conflict in other duplicates. In other cases, interactions between the factors may define a circuit with dynamic properties not implementable by a single gene [56–58]. Further studies will define the relative contribution of such circuit-forming mechanisms in explaining the retention of TFs or other duplicates.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStrains\n\nAll strains used in this study and their genotypes are listed in S1 Table. All the strains were constructed by standard genetic methods and were validated by PCR and/or sequencing of the relevant DNA. The strains with the duplication of Msn2 and Msn4 (S1 Table, 31–32) were generated by PCR duplication procedure, described by Huber and colleagues [59].\n\nsmFISH\n\nFor each gene (MSN2 and MSN4), a set of 48 probes was generated as described in Raj and colleagues [30]. The probes were designed by the online program Stellaris Probe Designer from Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA, USA) and were ordered with a fluorescent dye CAL Fluor Red 590 (Biosearch Technologies). Probe sequences are listed in S2 and S3 Tables.\n\nCells were grown overnight in synthetic complete (SC) medium at 30°C and constant shaking. Then diluted to reach the wanted cell densities after approximately 12 hours. Cells were fixated, prepared, and hybridized as described in Rahman and colleagues [60].\n\nImages were acquired with a 100× 1.4 oil UPLSAPO objective, using an Olympus IX83 based Live-Imaging system equipped with CSU-W1 spinning disc (sCMOS digital Scientific Grade Camera 4.2 MPixel, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK). For each sample, 4–6 different positions were chosen. In each position, three-channel Z-stacks images were taken with a step size of 200 nm for a total of &gt;6 μm: bright-field image, 488 nm laser with 100 mW; DAPI image, 405 nm laser with 120 mW and exposure time of 250 ms; mRNA image, 561 nm laser with 100 mW and exposure time of 1,000 ms. Each z-plane image was of size 2,048 × 2,048 pixels.\n\nSingle-molecule quantification. Cells were segmented using a modification of a custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) software [61]. In this modification, cell centers were defined manually using the bright-field images, and cell borders were found automatically. mRNA counts were then performed for each cell based on the custom-made MATLAB software from Raj and colleagues [30].\n\nStress experiments for RNA-seq levels\n\nIn these experiments, we used the WT strains, the single msn2 or msn4 deletion strains, and the double msn2 and msn4 deletion strain. Some of the experiments were also done with the strains with swapped promoters: MSN2 ORF under MSN4 promoter with a deletion of MSN4 and the opposite, MSN4 ORF under MSN2 promoter with an MSN2 deletion.\n\nGrowth conditions. Cells were grown overnight in rich medium—YPD or SC medium at 30°C (unless otherwise noted)—and constant shaking, then cells were diluted and exponentially grew for 6–8 hours before introducing the stress:\n\nOxidative stress. Cells were grown continuously in 30°C. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM.\n\nHeat shock. Cells were grown continuously in 25°C, then cell culture was moved to a new flask located inside a bath orbital shaker (Cat. WBT-450; MRC, London, UK) preheated to 37°C. It took less than 90 s for the culture to reach 37°C.\n\nGlucose limitation. Cells were grown in SC medium with 2% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, cells were washed twice and resuspended in SC with 0.1% glucose. Samples were taken before the washes (2% glucose), after every wash, and for the next 100 min.\n\nOsmotic shock. Cells were grown continuously in 30°C. 4 M NaCl solution was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.4 M or 1.2 M.\n\nLow nitrogen. Cells were grown in SC medium with 2% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich). Then cells were washed twice and resuspended in nitrogen-depleted medium (0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate [Bacto-YNB], 2% glucose, 0.05 mM ammonium sulfate, 20 mg/l uracil, 20 mg/l histidine, 100 mg/l leucin, 20 mg/l methionine).\n\nGrowth into stationary phase. Cells were grown in SC in 30°C without changing the media.\n\nRNA sample collection, extraction, and sequencing\n\nCells were grown overnight to stationary phase and then diluted in 100 ml to reach OD600 of 0.2–0.4 after 6–8 hours in constant shaking. A sample for time-point zero reference was taken, and then we introduced a stress perturbation as described above. For the growing into stationary phase experiment, a sample of 1 ml was taken every 20 or 30 minutes. For all other conditions, a sample of 1.5 ml was collected every 3 minutes for the first hour and every 10 minutes for an additional half/one hour. Samples were immediately centrifuged for 40 s in 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until RNA preparation.\n\nRNA was extracted using a modified protocol of the nucleospin 96 RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). Specifically, cell lysis was done in a 96 deep-well plate by adding 450 μl of lysis buffer containing 1 M sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM EDTA, and 0.45 μl lyticase (10 IU/μl). The plate was incubated at 30°C for 30 minutes in order to break the cell wall and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2,500 rpm, and supernatant was removed. From this stage, extraction proceeded as in the protocol of nucleospin 96 RNA kit, only substituting β-mercaptoethanol with DTT.\n\nFor all samples sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), RNA libraries were created as follows: fragmented, poly(A)-selected RNA extracts of approximately 200 bp size were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using barcoded poly(T) primers. cDNA was amplified and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using a primer complementary to the opposite adaptor to the poly(A).\n\nFor all samples sequenced by the Illumina NextSeq 500, RNA libraries were created as follows: poly(A) RNA was selected by reverse transcription with a barcoded poly(T) primer. The barcoded DNA–RNA hybrids were pooled and fragmented by a hyperactive variant of the Tn5 transposase. Tn5 was stripped off the DNA by treatment with SDS 0.2%, followed by SPRI beads cleanup, and the cDNA was amplified and sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq 500.\n\nProcessing and analysis of RNA-seq data\n\nWe mapped 50-bp reads of the RNA-seq of every sample to the S. cerevisiae genome (R64 in SGD) using bowtie (parameters:–best -a -m 2 -strata -5 10). After alignment to the genome, samples that had less than 150,000 reads were discarded from the analysis in order to prevent an artificial enrichment for highly expressed genes. The expression at those time points was calculated as the mean between the two closest time points in the time course. For every sequence, we normalized for PCR bias using the unique molecular identifier (UMI), scoring each position on the genome by the unique number of UMIs it had out of all possible UMIs. For each gene, we summed all the reads aligned to 400 bp upstream its 3′ end to 200 bp downstream in order to get the total expression of that gene. Reads that were aligned nonuniquely were split between the aligned loci according to the ratio of all other uniquely mapped reads in these regions. The number of reads for each sample was normalized to 106.\n\nMsn2-Promoter library preparation\n\nWe used 140 synthetic promoters from Keren and colleagues [32] pooled together and transformed them to replace the native MSN2 promoter in a strain with Msn2 tagged with YFP and deleted of msn4. We collected approximately 200 colonies after the transformation and measured YFP fluorescence with a flow cytometer (BD LSRII system from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). We picked 50 strains that spanned the expression range and were highly similar between the different repeats.\n\nGrowth experiment in harsh stress\n\nMSN2 promoter library strains. We grew the cells to stationary phase in SC media in a 96-well plate under constant shaking and 30°C. Next, we diluted the cells with fresh SC media in deep-well plates with one glass bead in each well to generate proper shaking so they would reach the wanted OD in the next morning. Then, right before stressing the cells, we took 150 μl to measure ODs (using infinite200 reader; Tecan Inc., Männedorf, Switzerland) and 100 μl to a flow cytometer to measure Msn2-YFP fluorescence.\n\nOther strains. We grew cells overnight to stationary phase in SC media and constant shaking at 30°C. Next, we serially diluted the cells with fresh SC media in a 96-well plate to reach sequential different ODs in the next morning. Then, right before stressing the cells, we took 150 μl to measure ODs (using infinite200 reader, Tecan Inc.) and diluted the cells to the same density.\n\nStress and growth measurements. We added 30 μl of growing cells to plates with 120 μl of H2O2. We inserted the plates into an automated handling robot (EVOware, Tecan Inc.) in which cells were grown in an incubator under constant shaking and 30°C. The robot was programed to take the plates out of the incubator every 30 or 45 minutes, vortex the plates, and measure the OD (using infinite200 reader, Tecan Inc.). Experiments lasted for approximately 70 hours. (An EVOware script for this experiment can be provided upon request.)\n\nGrowth analysis. Data from the growth measurements were parsed and processed. Time to exponential growth was calculated as the time of the maximal slope of the OD measurements (versus time). We calculated the median time and the standard deviation of the repeats.\n\nCompetition experiment in SC media\n\nCells were grown ON to stationary phase in SC, then diluted and grown for approximately 8 hours in exponential growth. Each strain was then coincubated with WT-mCherry strain at 30°C. WT initial frequency was approximately 50%. Approximately every 8 hours, cells were diluted with fresh SC media so they would grow exponentially at all times. In addition, a sample was taken to measure OD and to a flow cytometer to measure frequencies of each population. Flow cytometry measurements and analysis were done using the BD LSRII system (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was conducted with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 ± 25 nm for GFP samples. For mCherry markers, excitation was conducted at 594 nm and emission at 610 ± 10 nm. The number of generations was calculated from the dilution factor. Percent of WT division rate was calculated as previously described in Kafri and colleagues [62].\n\nMsn2,4 protein expression by flow cytometry\n\nFor this experiment, we used a strain with Msn2 tagged with GFP and a strain with Msn4 tagged with GFP and Msn2 tagged with mCherry. We grew the cells overnight in 5 mL SC media at 30°C and constant shaking to reach the stationary phase, then we diluted the cells to reach OD600 approximately 0.4 after approximately 8 hours. Next, we serially diluted the cells in a 96-well plate by diluting each column to the next one in a 1:1 ratio with SC media, ending up with 120 μl in each well, and a 1:2 ratio of cells in adjacent columns. After overnight incubation in 30°C and constant shaking, we measured the fluorescence using flow cytometer.\n\nFlow cytometry measurements and analysis were done using the BD LSRII system (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was conducted with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 ± 25 nm for GFP samples. For mCherry markers, excitation was conducted at 594 nm and emission at 610 ± 10 nm. The average number of cells analyzed was 50,000. For the samples with high OD, 100 μl of DDW was added to the sample before reading it in the FACS.\n\nWe calculated cell density using the flow cytometer parameters and output. This measure was calculated as following: NVC where R = flow rate (μl /s), T = total flow time (s), V = R*T = total volume read (μl), N = number of cells read (cells), C = dilution fix constant (values are either 1 for no dilution with DDW or 1.8333 for samples that were diluted with 100 μl DDW).\n\nWe filtered G1 cells similarly to how it was described in Hornung and colleagues [26]. Specifically, we filtered by the width size measure FSC-W, which has a bimodal distribution that corresponds to cells in G1 (smaller) and cells in G2/M (bigger). Next, we filtered outliers by two area measures, FSC-A and SSC-A. We used linear regression to describe FSC-A with SSC-A and removed cells that were far from the regression line. We then applied linear regression to describe SSC-A with FSC-A and removed outliers in a similar manner.\n\nIn order to eliminate the background fluorescence, we used a linear regression model that predicts background fluorescence. The independent variables were size parameters (FSC-W and SSC-W) and the cell density of the population. The dependent variable was the background fluorescence (GFP/mCherry). The model was trained on BY4741 cells with no fluorescent markers, then used to predict background in the other strains. Predicted background was subtracted from observed fluorescence for each cell.\n\nMsn2 protein expression noise by flow cytometry\n\nTo measure the noise in the strains expressing Msn2-YFP, we grew the cells overnight in 5 mL SC media at 30°C and constant shaking to reach the stationary phase. Then, we diluted the cells to reach OD600 approximately 0.4 after approximately 8 hours. We measured fluorescence using a flow cytometer as described in the previous part. We then filtered the cells and calculated the noise of the population as described in Hornung and colleagues [26].\n\nTime-lapse microscopy experiment\n\nWe used a strain with both Msn2-mCherry and GFP-Msn4 and a strain with GFP-Msn4 and a deletion of Msn2. We grew the cells overnight in SC media to reach stationary phase, then diluted them to reach the desired OD600 (approximately 7) after approximately 8 hours. When reaching the desired OD, cells were transferred to a microfluidics plate (catalog number: Y04C-02-5PK; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) for haploid yeast cells. We used an ONIX CellAsic microfluidics system, which allows changing the cells’ media at a fast rate in a predefined set time while not interfering with the imaging process. During imaging, after approximately 15 minutes of flowing the original media of the cells, medium with NaCl was added to the cells (0.4/1.2/1.4 M). Two positions were taken for each strain.\n\nImaging. We used a Zeiss AxioObserverZ1 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with Hamamatsu Flash4 sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan). In every imaging instance (every 1 minute for 4–8 hours), three images were taken for each position: bright-field image, GFP image using GFP filter with 20% intensity of HSP120 V lamp and with exposure time of 200 ms, and mCherry image using mPlum filter with same intensity and exposure as GFP. We used 2 × 2 binning, resulting in 1,024 × 1,024 pixels of image size.\n\nProcessing microscopy images and estimate nuclear localization levels\n\nTracking and segmentation. All images were subsequently analyzed using custom MATLAB software that segments and tracks individual cells along the movie in each bright-field image frame, as previously described [61]. Briefly, cell borders were detected automatically in the last frame. Then, the program goes back to the beginning of the experiment frame by frame and, for each cell in the image, uses the centroid coordinates of the cells from the previous frame. Each centroid is expended until the borders of the cell in the current frame is found. The program also outputs a score for the segmentation that was used to filter out cells with low quality segmentation.\n\nImage processing. Median filter: we ran a 3 × 3 median filter on all GFP and mCherry images. Background removal was done by running a mean filter of 50 × 50 on each image, then subtracting the filtered image from the original one. Rare events of missing frames (mainly due to focus issues) were interpolated to be the mean of the two adjacent frames.\n\nCalculating nuclear localization measure. Our method uses image filtering with a filter shaped like a nucleus with a radius of 3 pixels. We run the filter on each cell GFP/mCherry track and then find the maximal coordinate of the filtered cell image, defining it as the center of the hypothetical nucleus. Our measure is the average over the pixels in the hypothetical nucleus divided by the pixel average in the hypothetical cytoplasm. For normalization, we divide each cell’s Msn2/4 nuclear localization in time by the minimal value for this cell. As a result, this method, in fact, gives signal-to-noise ratio. In order to align the GFP and the mCherry tracks together, we used z-score normalization (subtracted the mean and divided by standard deviation for each cell).\n\nFiltering bad cells. We filtered out “bad” cells in two rounds, once after running segmentation and once after calculating the dynamical attributes. In the first round, we filtered cells that answered one or more of the following conditions: (1) cells with area outside the range defined as median ± 3 × mean absolute deviation (MAD) over all cells at least 10% of the time, (2) cells with segmentation score &lt;8 at least 10% of the time, and (3) cells that did not appear from the beginning of the experiment. In the second round, we removed cells with response amplitude below 1.1 or above 6.\n\nMSN2,4 homolog expression in growth\n\nData were taken from Thompson and colleagues [50]. For each yeast species in this experiment, 5 time points were measured as a ratio to mid-log sample: lag, late log, diauxic shift, postdiauxic shift, plateau. For each time point, 3 repeats were made. We show the average of the repeats. We exclude the first time point (lag) from the figure because of a large amount of missing data and repeats.\n\n5′ mRNA sequencing\n\nCells were grown overnight to stationary phase in SC media in 30°C and then diluted and exponentially grown for approximately 12 hours in constant shaking. Samples were fixed by mixing them with cold (−80°C) methanol. RNA was poly(A)-selected, reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and barcoded at the 5′ end using Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was pooled and fragmented by a hyperactive variant of the Tn5 transposase. Tn5 was stripped off the DNA by SDS 0.2% treatment, followed by SPRI beads cleanup, and the cDNA was amplified and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 500. The number of reads for each sample was normalized, and genomic tracks were created from the sequenced reads, representing the enrichment on each position of the genome.\n\nChEC-seq strains\n\nWe fused Msn2 or Msn4 to MNase (Amino Acids 83–231) using pGZ108 (pFA6a-3FLAG-MNase-kanMX6). This plasmid was a gift from Steven Henikoff (Addgene plasmid #70231; Watertown, MA, USA).\n\nChEC-seq experiment\n\nCells were grown overnight to stationary phase in SC media in 30°C and then diluted and grown for approximately 15 hours in 30°C and constant shaking until they reached OD600 of approximately 4. Then, ChEC-seq was performed as described in Zentner and colleagues [42] with 30 s of activated Mnase, and changes in the ethanolic precipitation (1 hour in −80°C), and SPRI beads size selection (0.8×). Library preparation was performed as describe in Orsi and colleagues [63], with converting the S-300 column cleanup following the phenol-chloroform step to ethanolic precipitation. Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq 500.\n\nChEC-seq analysis\n\nReads were mapped to the S. cerevisiae genome (R64 in SGD) using bowtie2. The first nucleotide of every read was counted as a binding signal. All samples had &gt;106 reads. Each sample was normalized to 107 reads. Promoter length was defined as 700 bp upstream to the TSS or the distance to the upstream transcript (the shorter between these two). Transcription start and end sites were taken from Pelechano and colleagues [64]. For the motif analysis, the average of the sum of signal of each 7-mer appearance (±10 bp) in all of the promoter regions was calculated.\n\nSupporting information"
