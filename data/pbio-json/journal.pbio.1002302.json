  "fullText": "Notice of Republication\n\nDue to the publication of copyrighted material, this article has been republished in order to remove this content from Fig 4, and from the published record. Please see below for full details.\n\nIn addition to this, the authors would like to make the following corrections and clarifications to Fig 2 and Fig 4, as well as to Supporting S1 and S8 Figs. The corrections are as follows:\n\nIn Fig 2, due to errors in gel loading order for the BAF-180 and BAF-250 knock-down time-course western blot analysis, the affected sample lanes were spliced into the correct order when the Fig 2D image was created. The β-actin lanes were, however, not correspondingly spliced in the originally published version as the signal was constant and did not change upon BAF-180 or BAF-250 depletion. In the corrected Fig 2D, we now clearly indicate all the relevant splice lines and have also spliced the β-actin lanes corresponding to the BAF-180 and BAF-250 panels to follow the same splicing pattern. The conclusions from this figure are not affected.\n\nThe corrected Fig 2 file is provided.\n\nIn Fig 4 the two FLAG-Tat panels within panel 4A were intentionally duplicated for presentation purposes in the originally published figure. They demonstrated expression of Tat in the A2 cell line after PMA treatment. These panels were included for presentation purposes as the same starting material (-/+ Tat) is used for both the Input and α-FLAG IP lanes. Due to this confusing presentation, the corrected figure now no longer includes the FLAG-Tat panels and instead includes an α-FLAG panel from a new replicate experiment (see below).\n\nThe originally published version of Fig 4A included FLAG-Tat, INI-1 and PKD panels that we had previously published in another journal (J Biol Chem. 2006 Jul 21;281(29):19960–8). They were also included in this PLOS Biology publication as controls for the specific Tat interaction with PBAF-specific BAF180 and not BAF250, which is the novelty of Fig 4 in this manuscript. When discussing this figure in article text, we had referred to the experiment and controls published in the JBC paper. However, due to reasons of copyright, we have now performed replicate experiments and in corrected Fig 4A we include this new data to replace the data that had previously been published elsewhere. The new replicate data provide the same results as the originally published version and the conclusions are unaffected.\n\nThe corrected Fig 4 file is provided.\n\nS1 Fig is being corrected to indicate a splice line between the PMA lane and the NaN3 1mM lane in panel S1B.\n\nThe corrected S1 Fig file is provided.\n\nIn S8 Fig the BAF250 panel (and its control Tubulin panel) and the BRG-1 panel (and its control Tubulin panel) from Figure 8A are intentionally duplicated in S8C Fig for presentation purposes and easy comparison. Similarly, the BAF250 panel (and its control Tubulin panel) and the BRG-1 panel (and its control Tubulin panel) from Figure S7D are also intentionally duplicated in S8F Fig for presentation purposes and easy comparison. To make the figure legend text more explicit than it currently is, we have added this clarification wording to the corrected S8 Fig legend. The figures remain unchanged.\n\nThe corrected legend for S8 Fig is provided.\n\nSupporting Information"
