  "abstract": "H2A.Z is an evolutionary conserved histone variant involved in transcriptional\n          regulation, antisilencing, silencing, and genome stability. The mechanism(s) by which\n          H2A.Z regulates these various biological functions remains poorly defined, in part due to\n          the lack of knowledge regarding its physical location along chromosomes and the bearing it\n          has in regulating chromatin structure. Here we mapped H2A.Z across the yeast genome at an\n          approximately 300-bp resolution, using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with tiling\n          microarrays. We have identified 4,862 small regions—typically one or two\n          nucleosomes wide—decorated with H2A.Z. Those “Z loci” are\n          predominantly found within specific nucleosomes in the promoter of inactive genes all\n          across the genome. Furthermore, we have shown that H2A.Z can regulate nucleosome\n          positioning at the GAL1 promoter. Within HZAD domains, the regions where\n          H2A.Z shows an antisilencing function, H2A.Z is localized in a wider pattern, suggesting\n          that the variant histone regulates a silencing and transcriptional activation via\n          different mechanisms. Our data suggest that the incorporation of H2A.Z into specific\n          promoter-bound nucleosomes configures chromatin structure to poise genes for\n          transcriptional activation. The relevance of these findings to higher eukaryotes is\n          discussed.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nEukaryotic chromosomes are packaged into a complex nucleoprotein structure termed\n        chromatin, from which the fundamental unit is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes are composed of\n        octamers of histone proteins designated as H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 that wrap approximately 146\n        bp of DNA [1,2]. Chromatin is generally highly\n        repressive to cellular processes that involve DNA transactions such as gene transcription\n          [3]. Cells have thus\n        devised at least three schemes to overcome the nucleosomal barrier: the first involves\n        adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis to mechanically displace nucleosomes [4,5], and the second consists of chemically modifying\n        the tails of histones, such as by acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and\n        ubiquitination [2].\n        This last scheme can take the form of a “code” where modifications act\n        as signals for subsequent chromatin modifications [6,7]. A third scheme that has been devised by cells to overcome the\n        nucleosomal barrier is to alter the composition of nucleosomes through the incorporation of\n        histone variants that can—directly or indirectly—alter the\n        permissiveness of chromatin to gene expression [8,9].\n\nNonallelic variants have been described for many classes of histones, and one of the\n        best-studied examples is the Z variant of H2A. H2A.Z, formerly called H2A.F/Z, is\n        evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals [10,11]. H2A.Z is essential for the viability of Tetrahymena,\n          Drosophila, and mice [12–14] and\n        constitutes approximately 10% of all cellular H2A molecules in S-phase\n          [15,16]. Experiments carried out in many organisms have\n        shown that H2A.Z has a function distinct from the canonical H2A [13,17,18]. H2A variant histones differ mainly in their N- and C-terminal portions\n        as compared to S-phase H2A, whereas the core region is highly conserved [16]. In fact, experiments carried\n        out in Drosophila and in yeast have revealed that the unique feature of\n        H2A.Z important for its specific function resides in the carboxyl-terminal region of the\n        variant histone and not in its histone fold [18,19].\n\nIn Tetrahymena thermophila, H2A.Z has been found to be associated with the\n        transcriptionally active macronucleus, thus implying a positive role for H2A.Z in gene\n        transcription [20].\n        Subsequently, experiments carried out in yeast have shown that H2A.Z could regulate\n        transcription [19,21] and that its function is\n        partially redundant with nucleosome remodeling complexes such as SAGA and Swi/Snf\n          [21]. H2A.Z has been\n        shown to be quickly remodeled soon after gene induction [19,21–23], a\n        result that implies that the role of H2A.Z in positive gene transcription occurs at an early\n        step. In line with this idea, we have shown that the transcriptional machinery is not\n        efficiently recruited to the GAL1 promoter in\n        htz1Δ cells [19]. Another mechanism by which H2A.Z could\n        contribute to gene regulation has been suggested by Farris et al. [23], where they have shown at the\n          c-myc gene that transcription-induced chromatin transactions involve the\n        exchange of H2A.Z for canonical H2A.\n\nIn addition to its well-established role in transcriptional activation, a recent important\n        piece of work by the Madhani group showed that H2A.Z positively regulates clusters of genes\n        that are proximal to telomeres [24]. The gene expression defect observed at those gene clusters (called\n        HZAD domains) in H2A.Z mutants can be suppressed by the deletion of silencing proteins such\n        as Sir2. It has therefore been suggested that H2A.Z functions as an antisilencing factor by\n        antagonizing the spread of heterochromatin to euchromatic regions [24]. The expression of other\n        H2A.Z-affected genes, however, is not sensitive to Sir proteins suggesting H2A.Z positively\n        regulates gene expression via both antisilencing and other mechanisms.\n\nEvidence also suggests that H2A.Z can negatively regulate gene expression, notably through\n        gene silencing. In Drosophila and in yeast, H2A.Z was reported to be\n        involved in heterochromatic silencing [25,26]. In mammalian\n        cells, H2A.Z colocalizes with, and directly interacts with, heterochromatin protein 1 or\n        HP1-α (LocusLink:23468) and with INCENP (LocusLink:3619)—a protein\n        involved in chromosome segregation—in pericentric heterochromatin [27,28]. In addition, HP1-α and H2A.Z may\n        function together to establish a specialized conformation at constitutive heterochromatin\n          [27]. Thus, from\n        these findings it is clear that H2A.Z is important both for the positive and negative\n        regulation of gene expression.\n\nTo add to all of these recent findings, there has been the codiscovery of an adenosine\n        triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that specifically loads H2A.Z into\n        chromatin and exchanges it with H2A [29–31].\n        This complex, from which the catalytic subunit is Swr1, also shares essential subunits with\n        the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex [29]. In addition to their importance in gene\n        regulation, the Swr1 complex, H2A.Z, and NuA4 are all involved in the regulation of\n        chromosome stability in yeast [32]. This is interesting and important since it was also demonstrated that\n        in mammalian cells, knockdown of H2A.Z causes the genome to become unstable, a process that\n        is attributed to defects in chromosome segregation [33]. Of equal importance is the fact that H2A.Z is\n        required for early mouse and Xenopus development [13,14].\n\nDespite all the work reviewed above, the mechanisms by which H2A.Z regulates transcription,\n        silencing, genome stability, and developement remains largely unknown. A key piece of data\n        that is missing is a global view of the distribution of H2A.Z across the genome. Polytene\n        chromosome stainings have shown that Drosophila H2A.Z is widely distributed\n        in the genome, but with nonuniform distribution that is characterized by a complex banded\n        pattern [34]. From\n        these data, it is thus conceivable that certain regions of the genome are preferentially\n        occupied by variant histones and interspersed with regular histones. The resolution provided\n        by this assay, however, is not high enough to allow one to correlate H2A.Z localization with\n        its effect on gene expression. Experiments aimed at localizing proteins on defined chromatin\n        segments in vivo—chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—have been\n        performed at specific loci, but these experiments do not allow determining whether H2A.Z\n        assembles preferentially within large chromosomal domains, whether it is randomly spread out\n        across the genome, or whether it is associated with specific loci along chromosomes.\n        Answering this question is a crucial step toward understanding the various functions of this\n        important protein.\n\nHere we make use of a genome-wide location assay (ChIP–chip) to map H2A.Z across\n        the yeast genome with a 300-bp resolution. Our data show that H2A.Z preferentially and\n        specifically associates to small regions within the promoters of inactive yeast genes. We\n        also show that replacement of H2A.Z for regular H2A within the GAL1\n        promoter region perturbs nucleosome positioning, a situation that might account for the\n        transcription defect at the latter gene in the absence of H2A.Z. Interestingly, the very\n        strict promoter-specific association of H2A.Z that is otherwise observed elsewhere is not\n        observed for genes contained within the HZAD domains. At those genes, the presence of H2A.Z\n        can be detected within wider domains encompassing both the promoter region and part of the\n        open reading frame (ORF).\n\n      Results\n      \n        Genome-Wide Location Analysis of H2A.Z\n        \nIn order to investigate the genomic distribution of H2A.Z in yeast, we performed\n          genome-wide location experiments (also known as ChIP–chip) on whole-genome\n          tiling microarrays. The assay consists of first performing ChIP assays to\n          immunoprecipitate (IP) our target DNA molecules of interest. Thus, yeast cells are first\n          cross-linked with formaldehyde prior to being lysed. Chromatin fragments (approximately\n          400 bp) are next obtained by sonication and specific antibodies are then used to IP our\n          protein or proteins of interest along with their target DNA. Purified DNA is next\n          amplified by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), labeled, and hybridizing to an array that\n          contains a total of 44,290 60-mer probes (including controls) for an average of one probe\n          every 266 bp (see Materials and Methods for more\n          details). Thus, ChIPs were performed using yeast strains bearing Myc epitopes on H2A.Z and\n          on the canonical H2A. In every case, a ChIP for histone H2B (performed using an HA-tagged\n          H2B strain) was hybridized together with the H2A.Z (or H2A) ChIP to control for nucleosome\n          density. In addition, other control experiments where two Myc-H2A.Z ChIPs are hybridized\n          against each other were also performed. All experiments were performed in duplicate and\n          combined using a weighted average method. A Gaussian filter was then applied to each\n          dataset in order to create a smooth interpolation occupancy curve. The method allowed for\n          the identification of 4,862 loci enriched in H2A.Z, referred to below as “Z\n          loci.” The enrichment ratio for every probe on the microarray is available in\n            Table S1, whereas the\n          smoothed data can be found in Tables\n            S2–S4. The\n          coordinates of all Z loci are listed in Table S5. All datasets were deposited into ArrayExpress under\n          accession number E-MEXP-396.\n\n        H2A.Z Is Associated with Small Genomic Regions Present All across the Yeast Genome\n        \nThe 4,862 loci identified here are widely distributed across all chromosomes, and no\n          regions show any bias (see Figure 1\n          for a map of Chromosome III and Table\n            S6 to see the whole genome). Typical Z loci are less than 400 bp long, suggesting\n          that the variant histone occupies regions that are generally no larger than two\n          nucleosomes. This estimation is based on four observations. First, the probes enriched in\n          the H2A.Z experiments were not depleted in the H2A experiments (data not shown). Because\n          the average size of the DNA fragments used in our ChIP assays is 400 bp, this suggests\n          that most 400-bp fragments within the genome that contains H2A.Z will also contain H2A.\n          Since, in principle, a nucleosome cannot contain both H2A and H2A.Z simultaneously\n            [35], the data\n          suggest that H2A.Z occupies regions that are smaller than 400 bp. Second, the size of the\n          Z loci as they appear from the microarray data (see Figure 1, for example) are consistent with H2A.Z\n          occupying small regions—especially considering the fact that ChIP experiments\n          necessarily overestimate the size of the region bound by proteins due to the size of the\n          chromatin fragments generated. Third, high-resolution quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of\n          ChIP experiments using small overlapping PCR probes allowed us to map the Z loci within\n          the promoter of the SRB8 genes to an approximately 260-bp region using\n          TFIIB as a reference [36] (Figure 1D; see\n            Protocol S1 and Figure S1 for more details). Last,\n          alignment of our data with global nucleosome positioning information from Yuan et al.\n            [37] revealed that\n          H2A.Z maps to one or two nucleosomes in promoters (see below). Taken together, these\n          analyses show that H2A.Z occupies very small regions scattered across the genome, rather\n          than concentrating within large chromosomal domains.\n\n        H2A.Z-Containing Nucleosomes Are Essentially Located within Promoter Regions\n        \nWe next examined the actual location of the Z loci relative to genes. Manual inspection\n          of the data suggests that Z loci are predominantly located within promoter regions. This\n          feature is illustrated in Figure 1,\n          that shows (i) only one ORF within the 40-KB window shown in Figure 1C contains enrichment for H2A.Z; (ii) none of the\n          seven intergenic regions that do not contain any promoter in that region (for example,\n          between SOL2 and ERS1) contain a Z locus; (iii) there is\n          a Z locus upstream of every ORF shown in Figure 1C; and (iv) interestingly, the intergenic region between the divergently\n          transcribed YCR090C and KIN82 ORFs contains two separate\n          Z loci, supporting the idea that each promoter is decorated with its own H2A.Z\n          nucleosome(s). In order to systematically evaluate the H2A.Z preference for promoter\n          regions, we analyzed the relation between the H2A.Z/H2B ratio and the distance to the\n          closest 5′ gene boundary (for example, the ATG for protein-coding genes) for all\n          probes on the microarray. As shown in Figure\n            2A, H2A.Z binding (green line) is higher around the 5′ boundary with a\n          small bias toward the regions located just upstream compared to downstream (see inlet for\n          a zoom into the 5′ region). This relationship is not observed on random data\n            (Figure 2A, black line) or when the\n          proximity to the 3′ end of genes is examined (not shown). Because 5′\n          UTRs are very small in yeast, these data are consistent with H2A.Z being localized over\n          promoters, although we cannot rule out the possibility that H2A.Z is rather present within\n          the 5′ UTR since only a few transcriptional start sites have been annotated in\n          yeast. For the sake of simplicity the word “promoter” will be used\n          here to refer to the regions localized between 500 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of\n          the 5′ boundary of transcribed elements (this includes ORFs, but also other\n          transcribed elements such as Ty elements, tRNAs, etc.). This interval was chosen based on\n          a recent genome-wide analysis of yeast promoters [38]. As shown in Figure 2B, 74% (3,639 out of 4,862) of the Z\n          loci identified in this study are located within the promoter of annotated genes.\n          Considering that promoters account for about 31% of the yeast genome, this\n          translates into a 2.4-fold enrichment over a random uniform distribution\n          (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, we find that 63% (4,742 out\n          of 7,488) of yeast promoters are decorated with H2A.Z (Figure 2C). Conversely, only 2% of the H2A.Z\n          loci are located within intergenic regions that contain no promoters (where two genes are\n          transcribed convergently).\n\nIn a recent elegant study, the Rando group mapped nucleosomes over 482 KB of yeast DNA,\n          including most of the entire Chromosome III. They showed that the scored yeast promoters\n          contain a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked with well-positioned nucleosomes\n            [37]. A median\n          sliding window of their data is reproduced in Figure 2D (blue) along with our genome-wide location data with H2A.Z/H2B (green)\n          and H2A/H2B (gold) data for a composite of 1,850 genes [37]. Despite both assays having different\n          resolution, the figure clearly shows that H2A.Z is preferentially localized downstream of\n          the NFR in yeast promoters. More important, data from the figure suggest that H2A.Z may\n          occupy the first, and perhaps also the second, well-positioned nucleosome downstream of\n          the NFR (see cartoon in Figure 2D).\n          Taken together, these data suggest that H2A.Z targets specific nucleosomes within\n          promoters across the genome and therefore contributes to create a promoter-specific\n          chromatin structure.\n\nIn addition to class II promoter regions, we found H2A.Z loci at other transcribed units\n          such as tRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, rDNAs, and Ty elements, suggesting that the role of\n          H2A.Z in transcription is not limited to protein-coding genes (data not shown).\n          Interestingly, we also found H2A.Z loci centered around centromeres and replication\n          origins (data not shown). The association of H2A.Z to centromeres was also reported\n          previously [32], and\n          the role of H2A.Z in DNA replication and chromosomal segregation will be studied elsewhere\n          (Bataille et al., unpublished data).\n\n        H2A.Z Is Not Enriched in the Promoter Region of Highly Active Genes\n        \nData from Figures 1 and 2 have clearly shown that H2A.Z has a\n          preference for promoter regions. However, Figure 2B shows that up to 37% of promoters are not associated with a\n          Z locus. In order to investigate what determines the association of H2A.Z with some\n          promoters but not others, we investigated the correlation between H2A.Z promoter occupancy\n          and the transcription rate for all genes. As shown in Figure 3, there is an inverse correlation between the\n          transcription rate and H2A.Z occupancy. Accordingly, when the genome-wide location of\n          H2A.Z was determined for cells grown in galactose, we noticed that the occupancy of H2A.Z\n          was reduced, compared to its occupancy in glucose, at the promoters of 147 out of 173\n          genes whose expression levels have been demonstrated to be induced the most under those\n          conditions according to the study of Ren et al. [39]. These data are consistent with H2A.Z being\n          dynamically associated with inactive genes. These genomic observations are also in line\n          with our ChIP/Q-PCR data (see Protocol\n            S2 and Figure S2) and\n          with previously published evidence at specific promoters [19,21,22]. We would\n          like to point out that data represented in the experiment of Figure 3 were collected from a population of cells that\n          are heterogeneous in the sense that each cell is in a different physiological state and\n          phase of the cell cycle. For that reason, and also because promoters have inherently\n          different strengths, a given gene is never completely off or on within the population. The\n          observed transcription rate across all genes is therefore a continuum ranging from near\n          zero to about 300 mRNA per hour for genes that are the most transcriptionally active. The\n          transcription rate being a continuum, it is expected that the H2A.Z occupancy will also be\n          a continuum. In that regard, RNA pol II or general transcription factors like TFIIB also\n          show continuum-like binding patterns in those assays [36,40,41]. We also\n          propose that the low enrichment of H2A.Z from the promoter of highly active genes most\n          likely reflects the low abundance of nucleosomes in those regions since recent evidence\n          shows that the promoters of highly active genes are depleted of nucleosomes\n            [42–46]. Collectively, these data\n          show that H2A.Z specifically associates with one or a few nucleosomes within the promoter\n          of some inactive genes but is generally absent from the promoter of highly active genes.\n\n        H2A.Z Regulates Nucleosome Positioning\n        \nHaving established that H2A.Z is present at most yeast promoters, we sought to\n          investigate the functional significance of the promoter-specific localization of H2A.Z.\n          First, we investigated nucleosome positioning of genes that have Z loci (Figure 4A) versus genes that are devoid of\n          those loci (Figure 4B) as previously\n          defined in Figure 2, using data\n          presented in Yuan et al. [37]. The figure clearly shows that nucleosomes within the genes that bear\n          Z loci are well positioned, whereas nucleosomes positioning at genes that do not have Z\n          loci are significantly less well organized. This observation is consistent with the fact\n          that H2A.Z-free promoters are less covered by nucleosomes than the more frequent\n          H2A.Z-containing promoters (not shown). The figure further suggests that H2A.Z may play an\n          important role in organizing chromatin structure at promoters. Alternatively, however,\n          H2A.Z may associate with promoters as a consequence of their well-organized chromatin\n          structure. In order to test directly whether H2A.Z can regulate chromatin structure at\n          promoters, we studied nucleosome positioning at a model gene in wild-type (WT) and\n          H2A.Z-null (htz1Δ) cells. The GAL1 gene was\n          chosen for these experiments, since H2A.Z is required for its full expression and since\n          the variant histone preferentially binds the repressed promoter of that gene\n            [19,21]. Furthermore, chromatin structure at the\n            GAL1 promoter has been thoroughly investigated [47–50], so any changes in chromatin structure should\n          be experimentally tractable. First, we performed indirect end-labeling experiments on\n          chromatin samples that were partially digested by MNase. Figure 4C, left panel, shows that the gross nucleosome\n          positioning pattern is not significantly altered in htz1Δ cells\n          when the latter are grown in media containing glucose. However, we do note a slight shift\n          of nucleosome C (nucC) in a downstream position as well as a few other nucleosomes. The\n          right panel of that figure shows the cleavage pattern of MNase-digested naked\n          GAL1 promoter DNA. The UASG region can be easily identified as\n          it is quite resistant to MNase cleavage [49]. Since indirect end-labeling experiments only\n          have a resolution of approximately 20–30 bp, we decided to carry out\n          high-resolution LM-PCR assays of MNase-digested mononucleosomes at two positioned\n          nucleosomes within the GAL1 promoter region (nucB and nucC; see Figure 4D). Thus, LM-PCR linkers were\n          ligated to mononucleosome-purified DNA, and PCR reactions were carried out with external\n          oligonucleotides corresponding to the linkers in combination with oligonucleotides\n          corresponding approximately to the center of the nucleosome-protected DNA as previously\n          determined by Fisher-Adams and Grunstein [49]. These last oligonucleotides are designed to\n          either amplify the right-end portion of nucleosome-embedded DNA (R) of nucB and nucC, or\n          the left-end portion (L) (Figure 4D,\n          above). The results show that nucB does not shift position in the\n          htz1Δ mutant as compared to WT cells when PCR reactions were\n          performed at either the right or left boundaries of the nucB. However, in the case of\n          nucC, there is an approximately 20-bp shift to a downstream position in\n          htz1Δ cells as compared to the WT case (Figure 4D, right panel). More important, this shift was\n          observed with both the right and left boundaries of nucC. These results confirm our\n          observations in indirect end-labeling experiments and suggest that the absence of H2A.Z\n          induces a specific shift of nucC to a downstream position but has no effect on the\n          positioning of nucB. Our results suggest that H2A.Z may be enriched at the promoters of\n          inactive genes in order to modulate the position of key regulatory promoter-associated\n          nucleosomes. Because we found that most Z loci are located within well-positioned\n          nucleosomes and because H2A.Z-free promoters have a less organized chromatin structure\n          than H2A.Z-containing genes, it is tempting to speculate that the variant histone also\n          plays a role in nucleosome positioning at other genes.\n\n        H2A.Z Is Unusually Localized at HZAD Genes\n        \nBecause genes contained within the so-called HZAD domains—unlike other H2A.Z\n          regulated genes—are proposed to be regulated by H2A.Z through an antisilencing\n          mechanism [24], we\n          investigated more closely the distribution of H2A.Z at those genes. First, manual\n          inspection suggested that H2A.Z occupied larger regions at those genes. As shown in Figure 5A, the regions occupied by H2A.Z\n          around the GIT1 gene (an HZAD gene) extend both upstream as well as\n          downstream within the coding region as compared to a non-HZAD gene such as\n          SRB8 (see Figure 5B).\n          Similar examples can be found in Figure S3. In order to investigate this in an unbiased manner, we have\n          calculated the size of the regions localized between the coordinates where the H2A.Z\n          occupancy curve approaches baseline (log2 ratio = 0.1). This size provides an\n          estimation of the width of the Z loci. Figure\n            5C shows a plot of that size relative to the distance to chromosome ends. The\n          figure shows that H2A.Z covers larger uninterrupted regions within the first 20 KB from\n          telomeres compared to telomere distal regions. This is consistent with H2A.Z occupying\n          wider regions around HZAD genes than at other genes in the genome. This conclusion was\n          also reached using a different analysis described in Figure S4 and Protocol S3 and is not dependent on\n          a difference in gene density at telomeres (not shown). This phenomenon is not restricted\n          to HZAD genes since many telomere-proximal non-HZAD genes also show the same pattern (not\n          shown). It is therefore possible that the antisilencing function observed at HZAD genes\n          could actually be extended to more (perhaps most) telomere-proximal genes. Three\n          possibilities could account for this wider distribution. First, H2A.Z could occupy more\n          nucleosomes at those genes. Second, the number of nucleosomes occupied by H2A.Z may be the\n          same, but these nucleosomes may not always be the same in different cells. Finally, it is\n          also possible that chromatin at those genes is more fluid such that the H2A.Z nucleosomes\n          can be found anywhere along a long stretch of DNA.\n\n      Discussion\n      \nWe have investigated the genome-wide distribution of histone variant H2A.Z as compared to\n        the regular S-phase histone H2A. Our results show that H2A.Z can preferentially associate to\n        narrow regions of yeast promoters. Surprisingly, the variant histone is present within most\n        nucleosome-containing promoters. Conversely, the promoters of highly transcribed genes are\n        not predominantly enriched in H2A.Z. Furthermore, and much to our surprise, H2A.Z does not\n        appear to be as sharply localized within HZAD genes. The wider distribution of H2A.Z at HZAD\n        genes may be important for preventing Sir protein spreading at those regions. Since H2A.Z\n        shows a strong preference for inactive gene promoter regions, we also investigated whether\n        the variant histone had an important role in modulating chromatin structure at the\n          GAL1 model gene. More important, we find that the replacement of H2A.Z\n        for regular H2A in cells induces a shift in the positioning of a nucleosome located over the\n        transcription start site. In accordance with this finding is the fact that nucleosomes at\n        promoter regions bearing Z loci are well positioned as compared to genes not enriched in\n        H2A.Z. Taken together, our results support a model where H2A.Z associates to specific\n        nucleosomes in the promoters of inactive genes in order to poise, and perhaps organize,\n        chromatin structure in a fashion that is permissive to transcription initiation. However, it\n        remains to be determined whether the simple incorporation of H2A.Z into specific nucleosomes\n        is by itself necessary and sufficient to facilitate gene activity or whether additional\n        factors are required for that action. The first possibility is supported by the fact that in\n        vitro-assembled chromatin arrays containing H2A.Z are inherently more resistant to\n        condensation as compared to H2A-containing nucleosomal arrays [51,52]. On the other hand, work from our laboratory\n        has shown that H2A.Z can interact with regulatory proteins and components of the\n        transcriptional machinery [19], arguing that H2A.Z may regulate gene expression through interactions\n        with such downstream effectors.\n\nAlthough H2A.Z has been previously shown to be enriched at the GAL1, PHO5,\n        and PUR5 genes [21,22], the fact that\n        H2A.Z globally associates to defined promoter regions of inactive genes is surprising since\n        previous studies had suggested that even though H2A.Z was generally enriched in euchromatic\n        regions, there did not appear to be any correlation between deposition of the variant\n        histone and promoters [24,30]. However, we note that in those\n        cases where H2A.Z was found more enriched in the ORF as compared to the promoter, the genes\n        were highly transcribed housekeeping genes (e.g.,ACT1 and\n        ADH1) [24,30]. Recent\n        studies have clearly established that the promoters of such highly active genes are rather\n        depleted of nucleosomes [42–46], and\n        thus the apparent low enrichment of H2A.Z at those promoters could actually reflect low\n        nucleosome occupancy. In support of this conclusion, we find that H2B levels are\n        significantly reduced at the ACT1 promoter, while the H2A.Z/H2B ratio shows\n        a slight enrichment in the promoter region (see Figure S2C). Because housekeeping genes are by definition transcribed\n        in most, if not all, conditions, and since we found that H2A.Z is present at promoters of\n        genes when they are inactive, we favor a model where H2A.Z would be more important for the\n        regulation of nonhousekeeping genes that are generally repressed when grown in rich medium\n        but are strongly induced under specific growth conditions (e.g.,GAL genes\n        upon galactose induction, etc.). It is interesting to note that this last possibility is in\n        line with published evidence regarding the role of H2A.Z in higher organisms. For example,\n        H2A.Z is not significantly expressed in the nondifferentiated inner cell mass tissue of the\n        mouse embryo, whereas it is highly expressed in the differentiating tissues [28]. Furthermore, H2A.Z is required\n        for the proper development of Xenopus [13]. These observations may be taken to suggest\n        that H2A.Z is only required when a particular gene expression program is engaged in an\n        organism and not so much for gene expression that pertains to basic cellular metabolisms.\n        Since H2A.Z has been shown to be abundantly associated with heterochromatin in higher\n        eukaryotes [28]—which is much more preponderant in metazoans as compared to\n        yeast [53,54]—it remains to be determined whether\n        or not the variant histone plays additional functions linked to this localization in\n        metazoans. It is worth emphasizing, however, that this colocalization of H2A.Z with metazoan\n        heterochromatin does not exclude the possibility that it may also be associated with the\n        promoter regions of inactive genes as we have shown with yeast. This possibility is\n        currently under investigation.\n\nOur genome-wide location assay has revealed that—as opposed to what is observed\n        at other genes—H2A.Z occupies wider regions that spread out well beyond the\n        promoter region and into the ORF, at HZAD genes. As previously suggested by Meneghini et al.\n          [24], it is\n        conceivable that H2A.Z has a dual role in gene expression, the first being that of poising\n        genes for transcription initiation in euchromatin, and the second being that of protecting\n        euchromatin from silencing. We propose that at most inactive genes where H2A.Z has a sharp\n        promoter-binding pattern, H2A.Z will simply be incorporated into specific repressive\n        nucleosomes that need to be remodeled quickly prior to gene induction, whereas at HZAD\n        genes, H2A.Z would create nucleated domains that are refractory to gene silencing by\n        heterochromatin. Alternatively to this scenario, it is possible that the broad distribution\n        of H2A.Z at HZAD genes reflects unstable positioning of variant histone-bearing nucleosomes,\n        perhaps due to a chromatin structure that is less well organized at those genes. This last\n        possibility, however, is less likely since examination of the nucleosome positioning data\n        from Yuan et al. [37]\n        reveals that nucleosomes are well positioned over the Chromosome III-contained HZAD genes.\n        Nevertheless, it is likely that the specific chromatin structure exemplified by this unusual\n        localization of H2A.Z renders the HZAD genes more sensitive to Sir2 silencing.\n\nOur observations that H2A.Z is also important in regulating nucleosome positioning, in\n        particular at the GAL1 promoter, may account for a mechanism by which H2A.Z\n        regulates transcription. We had previously observed that absence of H2A.Z prevents RNA\n        polymerase II and TBP from being efficiently recruited to the GAL1\n        promoter, whereas the Gal4 activator was efficiently recruited to the gene [19]. In addition to these findings,\n        recent experiments from our laboratory have shown that Mediator, SAGA, and Swi/Snf also\n        cannot be efficiently recruited to GAL1 in the absence of the variant\n        histone (K. Lemieux and L. Gaudreau, unpublished data). We thus propose that improper\n        positioning of at least one nucleosome over the GAL1 transcription start\n        site may be sufficient to severely impair the recruitment of the entire transcriptional\n        machinery to the gene. Our results also emphasize the fact that chromatin architecture is\n        exquisitely regulated, and even subtle changes in its structure may trigger transcription\n        defects. A similar situation was recently reported with bromodomain factor 1 (Bdf1) and\n        histone H4-tail acetylation at the PHO5 gene. It was reported that a shift\n        of 2–3 bp of a positioned nucleosome at a PHO5-lacZ reporter\n        construct resulted in a defect in PHO5 induction in the absence of Bdf1 and\n        H4-acetylation [55].\n        This is of particular significance since Bdf1 is a component of Swr1.com that loads H2A.Z\n        into chromatin [29,30]. It is conceivable that\n        deletion of BDF1 prevents loading of H2A.Z into chromatin, and therefore\n        the Bdf1-related defect would be owed to improper loading of H2A.Z at the\n        PHO5 promoter. Alternatively, it is conceivable that Bdf1 could be a\n        downstream target of H2A.Z and important in mediating its function in nucleosome\n        positioning. These possibilities are currently under investigation. Finally, we point out\n        that our data do not exclude the possibility that H2A.Z could also be important in\n        transcription elongation since the latter histone variant has been shown to interact\n        genetically with the TFIIS elongation factor in yeast [30] and since it appears to be replaced by H2A\n        downstream of the c-myc promoter region during elongation [23].\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Yeast strains and genetic methods\n        \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae W303a strains carrying 3xMyc-H2A.Z, 3xMyc-H2A\n          or 3xHA-H2B were generated using PCR epitope tagging as described previously\n            [56]. All\n            URA3 markers were “popped-out” and strains were\n          verified by PCR and immunoblotting analyses. MAY424 (htz1Δ) was\n          described previously [19].\n\n        Antibodies\n        \nAntibodies in this study were from the following source: anti-Myc, (9E10; Santa Cruz\n          Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, United States); anti-HA (12CA5; Roche, Basel,\n          Switzerland); and anti-TFIIB, a kind gift from Richard A. Young.\n\n        ChIPs\n        \nChIP experiments were performed essentially as described previously [19,22] with some modifications. Briefly, 50 ml of\n          cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone supplemented with 2% dextrose, or\n          2% raffinose/5% galactose for GAL-induced\n          conditions, to an OD600 of 0.7 and fixed with 1% formaldehyde as\n          described [19].\n          Next, 500 μl of whole-cell extract was incubated with the appropriate antibody\n          coupled to magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech, Brown Deer, Wisconsin, United States).\n          Immunoprecipitated DNA was either used for genome-wide location analysis (see below) or\n          Q-PCR analysis. Briefly, immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were mixed with the\n          appropriate oligonucleotides and Brilliant SYBR Green Q-PCR Master Mix (Stratagene) in 20\n          μl final volume. Q-PCR was performed on an Mx3000P Real-Time PCR System\n          (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States). The sequences of the oligonucleotides\n          used for all of the Q-PCR experiments are available in Table S7.\n\n        DNA microarrays\n        \nThe microarrays used for location analysis were purchased from Agilent Technologies (Palo\n          Alto, California, United States). The microarrays contain a total of 44,290 60-mer probes\n          (including 2,306 controls), covering the entire genome (except for repetitive regions) for\n          an average density of one probe every 270 bp (±100 bp) within the probed\n          regions. The greatest distance between the end of one probe and the beginning of the next\n          is 540 bp, and 97% of the probes are within 350 bp of another one. The probes\n          were mapped to the genome (UCSC) using BLAST. More than 99.9% of the probes\n          mapped to a single locus, whereas 370 probes (&lt;0.1%) had multiple BLAST\n          outputs and were mapped accordingly. These microarrays were previously used to map histone\n          modifications [57].\n\n        DNA labeling and hybridization\n        \nLabeling was done as described before [58]. Briefly, the immunoprecipitated DNA\n          fragments were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to unidirectional linkers. The\n          DNA was then amplified by LM-PCR in the presence of aminoallyl-modified dUTP. The labeling\n          was carried out post-PCR using monoreactive Cy-dye NHS esters that react specifically with\n          the aminoallyl-modified dUTP. Hybridization was performed as described in Pokholok et al.\n            [57], using salmon\n          sperm in place of herring sperm DNA. Detailed hybridization and labeling protocols can be\n          found at http://www.ircm.qc.ca/microsites/francoisrobert/en.\n\n        Data analysis\n        \nThe data were normalized and replicates were combinined using a weighted average method\n          as described previously [39]. To interpolate between probes and identify Z loci, a standard\n          Gaussian filter (SD = 200 bp) was applied twice to the data. Z loci were defined as the\n          maxima of this smoothed occupancy curve (excluding maxima smaller than zero).\n\n        Chromatin analysis\n        \nS. cerevisiae nuclei were prepared as previously described\n            [59]. Nuclei were\n          washed once in digestion buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaCl,\n          and 1.4 mM CaCl2) and resuspended in 1.2 ml digestion buffer per gram of dry\n          weight.\n\nFor indirect end-labeling experiments, resuspended nuclei were digested with either 0, 1,\n          3, 5, 25, or 50 U/ml of MNase (USB, Cleveland, United States). DNA was prepared as\n          described [59].\n          Southern blot analysis was conducted using an EcoRI-BanII fragment from the\n            GAL1–10 region as a probe.\n\nFor LM-PCR nucleosome boundary mapping, 200-μl aliquots of resuspended nuclei were\n          digested with a final concentration of 100 U/ml of MNase (USB) for 10 min at 37 °C\n          and stopped with 4 mM EDTA. DNA was then prepared as described [59]. MNase-digested DNA was\n          ligated overnight to unidirectional linkers, and mononucleosome-length fragments were then\n          purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR reactions were conducted with linker-specific\n          and nucleosome-specific oligonucleotides, using JumpStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Sigma, St.\n          Louis, Missouri, United States), using the manufacturer's recommendations.
