  "abstract": "Rhodopsin recycling via the retromer, rather than degradation through lysosomes, can alleviate light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in Drosophila.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n\nRhodopsins are G protein-coupled receptors that function as light sensors in photoreceptors (PRs), and defective trafficking of rhodopsins often leads to PR degeneration in humans and flies [1]–[5]. Because vision is not required for animal survival, previous studies in Drosophila mostly focused on viable mutations that specifically impair PR function [1]. However, it is likely that numerous additional players encoded by essential genes have remained unidentified. We performed an eye-specific mosaic genetic screen [6] and found that loss of subunits of the retromer causes light-induced PR degeneration.\n\nThe retromer, a hetero-multimeric protein complex, retrieves specific proteins from endosomes, thereby preventing the degradation of these proteins in lysosomes [7]–[9]. The retromer is composed of Vps26, Vps29, Vps35, and certain sorting nexins (Snx) (Figure 1A, [7]–[9]). Most subunits are evolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7]–[9]). Mutations in some subunits (Vps35 or Snx3) of the retromer have been shown to decrease the abundance of Wntless (Wls) and impair the secretion of Wingless (Wg), a ligand of the Wnt signaling pathway [10]–[14]. Wls is a transmembrane protein that binds to Wg and is required for Wg secretion [15],[16]. Impaired retromer function leads to excessive degradation of Wls in lysosomes, severely reducing Wg secretion and signaling [10]–[14]. The retromer has also been shown to maintain the levels of Crumbs, a transmembrane protein required for maintaining the apicobasal polarity in some tissues [17],[18]. More recently, mutations in human VPS35 have been shown to cause a dominant inherited form of Parkinson's disease (PD) [19],[20]. However, the retromer has not been implicated in neurons of the visual system in flies or vertebrates.\n\nThe Drosophila compound eye comprises ∼800 hexagonal units named ommatidia [1],[2],[21],[22]. Each ommatidium contains eight PRs (R1–R8) that express rhodopsin proteins [1],[2],[21]–[23]. Rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) is the major rhodopsin that is primarily expressed in R1–R6 [1],[2],[21],[22]. It is synthesized and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to rhabdomeres, the stacked membranous structures in PRs, via the secretory pathway [1],[2],[21]. The proper transport of Rh1 from ER to rhabdomeres requires molecular chaperones [24]–[30] and Rab GTPases [24]–[33]. Binding of opsins to chromophores [34]–[40] as well as protein glycosylation and deglycosylation [41]–[44] are essential for Rh1 folding and maturation. Mutations in genes involved in Rh1 synthesis, folding, or transport can result in defective PR development or PR degeneration [24],[25],[32],[41]–[43],[45]–[51].\n\nPhototransduction in the PRs relies on the activation of Rh1 by photons (Figure S1A, [52]). Active Rh1 (metarhodopsin, M*) activates phospholipase C (PLC) [53], which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) [54]. DAG or its metabolites can activate Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) and TRP-like cation channels that lead to depolarization of the PRs [55]–[59]. Similar to fly PRs, the vertebrate intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) use melanopsin (a homolog of fly Rh1) as the light sensor and requires PLC and TRPC channels for activation [60]–[63]. ipRGCs project their axons to specific brain areas to control circadian rhythms [64]–[67] or pupillary light reflex [64],[68],[69].\n\nTight regulation of Rh1 activity upon light exposure is required to maintain the integrity of PR cells [1],[2]. M* can be converted into its inactive form upon exposure to orange light [52]. In addition, a significant portion of active Rh1 can be endocytosed and degraded in lysosomes [70]–[72]. Mutations that abolish Rh1 deactivation [72]–[74] or impair the endolysosomal system [71],[75],[76] can cause PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation. However, it is unknown whether Rh1 can be retrieved from the endolysosomal compartments and whether impaired Rh1 recycling leads to PR degeneration.\n\nHere, we show that loss of the fly Vps26 or Vps35 causes early-onset PR degeneration. We show that retromer subunits are expressed in PRs in flies and melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs in the mouse retina. In fly mutant PRs, the numbers of late endosomes and lysosomes are significantly elevated. The PR degenerative phenotypes are dependent on exposure to light and the presence of Rh1. Our data indicate that the fly retromer recycles Rh1, preventing Rh1 retention in the PR cell bodies and shunting Rh1 from being degraded in lysosomes, thereby promoting Rh1 redelivery to rhabdomeres. In summary, the retromer recycles Rh1, prevents an overload of the endolysosomal pathway, and salvages a substantial fraction of Rh1 from degradation in flies. It may also play a similar role in ipRGCs in the retina of vertebrates.\n\nResults\n\nVps26 Mutant PRs Display Light-Dependent PR Degeneration\n\nTo identify mutations that cause PR degeneration, we generated large mutant clones of essential genes in the eyes (Figure S1B) and screened for mutants that exhibit an age-dependent decrease in amplitude of electroretinogram (ERG) recordings [6],[77],[78]. Mutations in a complementation group XE52, which we later mapped to Vps26 (Figure S2A), result in a progressive loss of ERG amplitudes compared to the control (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). Reduced amplitudes in ERG recordings may result from aberrant PR development, a defective phototransduction pathway, or PR degeneration [1]. To address if the ERG defects are due to aberrant PR development, we examined the light response of dark-reared control (y w FRT19Aiso, the isogenized y w FRT19A flies, or iso; see Materials and Methods) and two Vps26 mutant alleles. Upon rearing the flies in the dark, the Vps261 and Vps262 mutants exhibit nearly normal ERG responses and the ERG amplitude and on- and off-transients in Vps261 mutant PRs are slightly reduced when compared to control (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). In addition, imaging of newly eclosed flies (see definition in Materials and Methods) revealed that the overall morphology of ommatidia is similar to control, although loss of a rhabdomere is observed at low frequency in the Vps261 mosaic clones (Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). These data indicate that mutations in Vps26 do not significantly affect PR development, allowing nearly normal ERGs in young flies.\n\nTo assess the impact of the Vps26 mutations in aged flies, we raised the animals either in a 12-h light/dark cycle (LD, L = 1,800 lux) or in constant darkness (DD) and recorded the ERGs at 0, 2, 4, 10, and 21 d. In LD, both alleles show a loss of on- and off-transients, indicating a loss of synaptic transmission. They also exhibit a reduced depolarization by day 2, and a progressive loss of the ERG amplitude with age (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). At day 21, the light-induced PR depolarization in Vps261 and Vps262 mutant PRs is almost completely absent (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). Strikingly, 3-wk-old DD-reared Vps261 and Vps262 mutants exhibit nearly normal ERG responses, similar to newly eclosed flies (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). The PR morphology of Vps261 and Vps262 mutants is severely affected in flies kept in LD for 21 d (Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). In addition, we constructed an EGFP-tagged genomic rescue construct (Vps26-gEGFP; see below and Figure S2A) that fully rescues the lethality (Figure S2B), ERG, and morphological defects of both Vps261 and Vps262 alleles (Vps261 GR in Figure 1B–E; Vps262 GR in Figure 1C and S1C–E). However, PR morphology is nearly wild-type when the flies are raised in DD (Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). In summary, PR degeneration in the Vps26 mutant clones is light-dependent.\n\nMutations in XE52 Map to Vps26\n\nTo identify the mutations in XE52 complementation group consisting of two alleles, we performed duplication, deficiency, and P[acman] rescue mapping (Yamamoto et al., in preparation), narrowing the locus to a 21 kb genomic region (Figure S2A). The XE52 alleles fail to complement the lethality of P{EP}Vps26G2008 (Figures S2A–B, [79]), a transposable element inserted in the 5′-UTR of the Vps26 gene. Sanger sequencing revealed mutations in conserved amino acid residues in both alleles: a nonsense mutation (K264*) and a missense mutation (V267D) in Vps261 and Vps262, respectively (Figure 1F). To test if Vps26 is responsible for both the lethality and PR degenerative phenotypes in XE52 alleles, we generated the Vps26-gEGFP genomic rescue construct mentioned above (Figure S2A) as well as a UAS-Vps26 full-length cDNA construct [80]. Both the genomic rescue and ubiquitously expressed cDNA (tub-Gal4&gt;UAS-Vps26) rescue all phenotypes (Figure 1B–E, Figure S1C–E, Figure S2B, and unpublished data), confirming that the phenotypes are caused by loss of Vps26.\n\nVps26 is a subunit of the retromer (Figure 1A, [81],[82]). Because loss of retromer function in Vps35 and Snx3 mutants has been previously documented to lead to defects in Wg signaling [10]–[14], we tested whether the Vps26 mutants isolated in our screen also exhibit this phenotype. We generated mutant clones of Vps261 in wing discs of third instar larvae and observed a failure to secrete Wg in the wing margin cells. Furthermore, we observed concomitant loss of Senseless (Sens) expression, a downstream effector of the Wingless pathway (Figure S2C, [83]). These data confirm the loss of retromer function in the Vps26 mutants.\n\nVps26 Is Primarily Localized to Early and Late Endosomes\n\nThe subunits of the retromer complex have been shown to primarily associate with endosomes in vertebrates [7]–[9]. However, the in vivo subcellular localization of the retromer in Drosophila has not been documented. We therefore raised a polyclonal antibody against the full-length fly Vps26 protein (Figure S2D–E) and costained with antibodies against Avalanche (Avl, fly homolog of Syntaxin 7, an early endosomal marker, [84]), Rab5 (an early endosomal marker, [85]), Rab7 (a late endosomal marker, [76]), Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI, an ER marker, [86]), GM130 (a cis-Golgi marker, [87]), Peanut Agglutinin (PNA, a marker for the trans-Golgi network (TGN), [88]), or Rab11 (a TGN or post-Golgi secretory vesicle marker, [31]). Vps26 shows substantially greater colocalization with Avl, Rab5, and Rab7 than the ER, Golgi, and secretory vesicle markers (Figure S2F–G). This distribution is seen in both wing discs and adult PRs (Figure S2F–G and unpublished data), indicating that Vps26 associates preferentially with early and late endosomes in different tissues in vivo.\n\nLoss of Vps35 Causes PR Degeneration\n\nVps35 acts as a scaffolding protein and physically interacts with Vps26 in the retromer (Figure 1A, [81],[82],[89]). RNAi knockdown of vps35 has been shown to reduce Vps26 protein levels in HEK293 cells [13]. Consistent with work in cultured cells, we find that mutant clones of the Vps35 null allele (Vps35MH20, [13]) in eye discs cause a nearly complete loss of Vps26 (Figure 2A), showing that the presence of Vps35 is required for Vps26 in vivo. Next, we performed ERG recordings and bright field imaging on large mutant clones of Vps35MH20 in flies aged for 0, 4, 10, and 21 d and examined function and morphology of Vps35MH20 mutant PRs. As shown in Figure 2B–C, the ERG phenotypes of Vps35MH20 are very similar to those of Vps26 shown in Figure 1. In addition, mutations in the two genes exhibit very similar morphological defects in aged PRs (compare Figure 2D–E with Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). These results indicate that the retromer is required to maintain PR function and morphology. Loss of the retromer therefore leads to light-dependent PR degeneration.\n\nSorting nexins can be involved in retromer-mediated protein trafficking [7]–[9],[90],[91]. To test whether these proteins are involved in the maintenance of PRs, we performed ERGs on Snx1d1 and Snx3d1 null alleles (Figure S3, [10]). Upon keeping the flies for 10 d in LD, we did not observe a difference in ERG amplitudes of Snx1d1 or Snx3d1 mutants (Figure S3A–B), although we observed a partial loss of the on-transient in Snx3d1 (Figure S3A,C). The data indicate that these sorting nexins are not part of the complex or play a minor role. In addition, we tested whether the WASH (Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homolog) complex, a protein complex that has been shown to be required for the transport of several retromer cargos in vertebrate cells and the fly tracheal tubes [8],[90],[91], is involved in PR degeneration. As shown in Figure S4, RNAi-mediated loss of a subunit of the WASH complex, Washout (the single WASH ortholog in Drosophila, [92]), does not affect PR maintenance and function. Hence, the retromer can have different compositions in different cells.\n\nLoss of Retromer Subunits Leads to an Expansion of the Endolysosomal Compartments in PRs\n\nThe retromer retrieves membrane protein cargos from the endolysosomal pathway [7]–[9]. To assess whether endosomes and lysosomes are affected in the absence of the retromer, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and examined the ultrastructure of Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs. Vps261 and Vps35MH20 flies raised in LD for 4 d show obvious ultrastructural defects (Figure 3B,D) in PRs when compared to control (Figure 3A). These defects include a dramatic increase in late endosomes (inset 1 in Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and yellow arrowheads in Figure S5B,D; [93]) and lysosomes (inset 2 in Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and arrows in Figure S5B–C,E; [94]). However, PRs of the dark-reared Vps261 or Vps35MH20 flies (Figure 3C,E–F and Figure S6B–E) do not show an increased number of late endosomes or lysosomes when compared to control (Figure 3A,F, Figure S5A, and Figure S6A). These data show that the endolysosomal pathway is severely affected in retromer mutants upon light exposure.\n\nInternalized Rh1 Fails to Be Recycled from the Endolysosomal Pathway in Vps26 Mutant PRs\n\nTo address whether the trafficking of endocytosed Rh1 is affected in the retromer mutants, we assessed Rh1 distribution in PRs that were exposed to light. Two protocols have been used for Rh1 immunostaining in fly PRs: whole mount preparations [76] and eye sections [41]. Previously, we showed that the whole mount protocol is more sensitive than staining of sections for Rh1 present in the cell body, while sections are better than whole mount staining for assessing Rh1 in rhabdomeres [6]. Here, we slightly modified the whole mount protocol to increase Rh1 signals in the PR cell body by treating the tissues with higher concentrations of Triton X-100. As shown in Figure S7, Rh1 signals are obviously enhanced upon increasing Triton X-100 concentration (top panels) compared to low Triton X-100 treatment (bottom panels). Here, we use the high Triton X-100 protocol for our immunostaining assays.\n\nAs previously reported [6],[76], immunostaining of Rh1 in dark-reared wild-type control PRs reveals a typical crescent-shaped staining pattern at the base of the rhabdomeres, due to the densely stacked rhabdomeric membranes that do not permit antibody penetration in whole mount preparations (Figure 4A, top panels). Similar to this control, we observed that the distribution (Figure 4A, top panels) and levels (Figure 5A–B) of Rh1 are not affected in Vps261 mutants prior to light exposure. These data are in agreement with the observation that dark-reared Vps261 mutants exhibit nearly normal ERGs and PR morphology (Figure 1B–E). Upon a 12-h light exposure, Rh1 is internalized in both control and Vps261 mutant PRs, as shown by the dramatic increase in Rh1 levels in the PR cell bodies (Figure 4A, middle panels). This increase in Rh1 is not due to the changes in levels of Rh1 (unpublished data), but rather because Rh1 becomes increasingly accessible to the antibodies upon endocytosis [6]. In addition, this light exposure is not pathological as control flies exhibit normal ERGs and PR morphology (Figure S8). However, upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is restored to the original levels in control but not in Vps261 PRs (Figure 4A, bottom panels). Similarly, although less obvious, we also observed Rh1 accumulation in Vps261 mutant PRs upon light exposure in the sectioned eye samples (Figure S9). Hence, the Rh1 subcellular localization is altered in Vps261 mutants.\n\nTo assess where in the cell body Rh1 accumulates in Vps261 mutants, we transiently exposed the flies to light and monitored the subcellular localization of Rh1 using markers. We briefly exposed the flies to blue light for 20 min followed by 5-min exposure to orange light (Figure 4B) to acutely induce endocytosis of a small amount of Rh1. This light condition is not pathological as the ERG responses and morphology of control PRs are normal (Figure S8). Upon recovery in the dark for 4 h, Rh1 can be detected in very bright punctae that often colocalize with Rab7 or Lamp1::GFP, a marker for lysosomes [95], in Vps261 PRs (Figure 4B–C), implicating that Rh1 is trapped in the endolysosomal compartments.\n\nRh1 retention in the endolysosomal pathway in Vps261 mutants upon an acute light exposure may be due to reduced Rh1 recycling and/or decreased lysosomal degradation. If Rh1 recycling is decreased, one would expect a reduction in Rh1 levels in Vps261 mutants compared to controls upon light exposure as an increased amount of internalized Rh1 will be delivered to lysosomes for degradation. On the other hand, if Rh1 degradation in lysosomes is impaired, one would predict that Rh1 abundance is elevated in Vps26 mutant PRs when compared to controls exposed to light. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we exposed the dark-raised flies to white light (1,800 lux) for 16 h. Prior to this light exposure, the Rh1 levels are similar in control and Vps261 mutants (Figure 5A–B), indicating that Rh1 expression is not affected in Vps261 mutants. Upon a 16-h exposure to white light, Rh1 levels in Vps261 mutant PRs are significantly decreased when compared to control (Figure 5A–B). Reduced Rh1 levels in Vps261 mutants upon light exposure do not appear to be due to impaired Rh1 synthesis as the Rh1 levels are restored after 6-h recovery in the dark (Figure 5A–B). Moreover, the ERG responses of Vps261 mutants are not affected upon this light exposure (Figure 5C–D). The data indicate that, in the absence of Vps26, lysosomes are able to degrade internalized Rh1 to maintain PR function when briefly exposed to light. However, chronic light exposure (LD for several days) severely affects the endolysosomal system (Figure 3 and Figure S5) because accumulated Rh1 in endosomes and/or lysosomes persistently challenges the endolysosomal system [2].\n\nTo examine whether the retromer is recruited to Rh1 punctae upon endocytosis in the PRs, we performed colocalization studies of Vps26 and Rh1. In the dark, Rh1 and Vps26 signals do not overlap (Figure 5E). In contrast, numerous Rh1 punctae colocalize with Vps26 in the PR cell body upon transient light exposure (Figure 5E). These data indicate that endocytosed Rh1 is a cargo of the retromer.\n\nReducing Endocytosis or Rh1 Levels Suppresses PR Degeneration in Vps26 Mutants\n\nIf PR degeneration in retromer mutants is caused by aberrant accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal pathway, reducing the amount of endocytosed Rh1 or the abundance of Rh1 itself may suppress PR degenerative phenotypes. Dynamin (encoded by the shi gene) is required for Rh1 endocytosis upon light exposure [73]. shits1, a temperature-sensitive dynamin allele, encodes a mutant protein that is functional at 18°C but loses its function at elevated temperature [96]. Although impaired dynamin function leads to death of adult animals at 26°C or higher temperature (unpublished data), shits1 mutant flies are viable and do not exhibit ERG defects at 24°C (Figure 6A–B). This permits us to conditionally reduce dynamin function in adult flies without impairing their light response. To address whether internalization of Rh1 is critical for the PR degeneration in Vps261 flies, we raised the Vps261,shits1 double mutants at 18°C and shifted the newly eclosed flies to 24°C to decrease dynamin function. We then performed ERGs on Vps261,shits1 double mutants kept in LD (Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 6A–B, reducing dynamin function significantly suppresses the loss in ERG amplitude in Vps261 mutants at day 4 in LD, indicating that Rh1 endocytosis plays an important role in PR degeneration upon loss of retromer function.\n\nTo address if a reduction in Rh1 suppresses the demise of the PRs, we tested flies that lack one copy of the Rh1 gene. Strong hypomorphic or null Rh1 alleles impair rhabdomere development in homozygous animals, as Rh1 plays a key signaling role in maintaining the structure of rhabdomeres [97],[98]. However, flies that are heterozygous for Rh1 loss-of-function alleles do not show aberrant PR development even when the Rh1 protein levels are reduced by 50% (Figure S10 and [50]). To assess whether a reduction of 50% in Rh1 levels is able to suppress the Vps26-associated PR degenerative phenotypes, we tested ERGs in mutants that carry a single copy of the Rh1 null allele (ninaE17, [99]). As shown in Figure 6C–D, flies that carry a single copy of Rh1 exhibit a significant suppression of the ERG defects seen in Vps261 mutant flies that have been kept in LD for 4 d.\n\nTo strongly reduce Rh1 levels, we next raised Vps261 mutants on low vitamin A containing fly food. Vitamin A is a dietary precursor of 11-cis 3-hydroxyretinal, the chromophore that is covalently linked to the Rh1 opsin [100]. A decrease in vitamin A leads to loss of the chromophore. Because the chromophore is essential for Rh1 folding and stability [39],[101], absence of vitamin A leads to reduced Rh1 levels in flies. Although this manipulation still allows the formation of rhabdomeres, the size is dramatically reduced due to the requirement of Rh1 as a major structural component [102]. Indeed, a reduction in dietary vitamin A leads to diminished rhabdomere size in both control and Vps261 mutants. Remarkably, vitamin A deprivation leads to a very strong suppression of the PR degeneration observed in Vps261 mutants at day 10 in LD (Figure 6E–F). In addition, the reduced ERG amplitudes of Vps261 are strongly suppressed upon vitamin A deprivation (Figure 6G). In summary, decreasing Rh1 levels suppresses the retinal degeneration associated with Vps261. This also suggests that elevated levels of Rh1 trapped in the endolysosomal pathway, rather than alterations in the levels of Rh1 in the rhabdomeres per se, underlie PR degeneration in Vps261 mutants.\n\nIncreased Levels of Vps35 or Vps26 Are Sufficient to Suppress PR Degeneration\n\nRh1 accumulation in late endosomes causes PR degeneration in flies that lack PLC activity (encoded by the no receptor potential A (norpA) gene, [76],[103]) (Figure 7A). If the retromer retrieves Rh1 from endosomes, increasing retromer levels might alleviate PR degeneration in norpA flies. We therefore overexpressed the fly Vps35 (actin-GAL&gt;UAS-Vps35,UAS-w RNAi) or Vps26 (actin-GAL&gt;UAS-Vps26,UAS-w RNAi) in norpAP24 mutants. Upon continuous exposure to white light for 6 d, norpAP24 mutants exhibit reduced numbers of rhabdomeres compared to control flies (Figure 7B, left and middle left panels and Figure 7C). In addition, the ommatidia organization is often aberrant in norpAP24 mutants (Figure 7B, middle left panel), indicating that the PRs are undergoing a progressive demise. Expression of Vps35 or Vps26 significantly restores rhabdomere numbers (Figure 7B, middle right and right panel and Figure 7C), suggesting that this manipulation is sufficient to suppress PR degeneration caused by Rh1 accumulation. In addition, expression of human Vps26B also suppresses the norpAP24 phenotypes (unpublished data). These data indicate that rerouting some of the Rh1 slated for lysosomal degradation delays PR degeneration.\n\nMutations that impair lysosomal function can also lead to Rh1-induced PR degeneration [76]. We therefore assessed whether increasing Vps35 or Vps26 expression suppresses PR degeneration in mutants that affect a subunit of the AP-3 complex. AP-μ3, encoded by carmine (cm), is required for the proper biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles [104]. Upon 6 d of light exposure, cm1 mutant PRs showed degenerative features [76], including loss of rhabdomeres and disruption of the ommatidia organization (Figure 7D, bottom left panel and Figure 7E). In addition, cm1 mutant PRs exhibit decreased ERG amplitudes (Figure 7F–G). Similar to norpAP24 mutants, increasing Vps35 or Vps26 in cm1 mutants restores the number of rhabdomeres (Figure 7D–E) and suppresses ERG defects (Figure 7F–G). These data indicate that increased retromer function can not only prevent PR degeneration in mutants with impaired late endosomal trafficking but also suppress PR degeneration caused by defective lysosomal function.\n\nVertebrate Retromer Homologs\n\nBecause the genes that encode the retromer proteins are evolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7]–[9]), we investigated whether the vertebrate Vps26 and Vps35 may also function in the visual system. As shown in Figure S11A, vps26A is expressed in the mouse retina based on Northern blots. In addition, we stained the retina of wild-type control or heterozygous mice containing a lacZ inserted in the vps35 gene [105]. Most of the melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs (92%) also express β-GAL (Figure S11B). To test whether human Vps26 homologs can substitute for the function of fly Vps26 in PRs, we ubiquitously expressed the human vps26A or vps26B cDNA in the Vps261 mutant background. Both human Vps26A and Vps26B were able to rescue the lethality of Vps261 mutant flies (Figure 8A–D). We also recorded ERGs from adult flies kept in LD for 21 d. As shown in Figure 8A–B, we observed a full rescue of the loss of ERG amplitude and on–off transients. In addition, PR degeneration in Vps261 mutants is fully suppressed by overexpressing human Vps26 proteins (Figure 8C–D). These results show that the human Vps26 homologs are able to perform the same function as the fly Vps26 protein.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Retromer Complex Is Required for Maintenance of Fly PRs\n\nThe retromer recycles specific proteins from endosomes to the TGN or plasma membrane [7]–[9]. Here we show that, although the loss of the retromer does not obviously affect eye development, mutations in Vps26 or Vps35 genes lead to strong light-dependent PR degeneration (Figure 1B–E, Figure 2B–E, and Figure S1C–E). The demise of Vps261 and Vps35MH20 PRs is associated with a significant increase in the number of late endosomes and lysosomes upon light exposure (Figure 3 and Figure S5), showing that the endolysosomal pathway is strongly affected when Rh1 recycling by the retromer is impaired. Indeed, Rh1 accumulates in late endosomes or lysosomes in the mutant PRs (Figure 4B–C). Although Rh1 can be degraded and the function of Vps261 mutant PRs is not abolished upon short light exposure (Figure 5A–D), chronic exposure to light is detrimental to Vps261 mutants because persistent Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal pathway is toxic to PR cells [71],[75],[76]. Hence, reducing Rh1 endocytosis or Rh1 levels in the rhabdomeres suppresses PR degeneration upon prolonged light exposure (Figure 6). Interestingly, increasing Vps35 or Vps26 in mutants that show PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal compartments [76] suppresses the degenerative phenotypes (Figure 7). In summary, the retromer is required to retrieve Rh1 from endosomes to maintain PR function and integrity (Figure 8E).\n\nHow does Rh1 internalization affect the endolysosomal pathway in retromer mutants? One possibility is that lysosomes in the mutants are unable to cope with the increased levels of internalized Rh1 over time as Rh1 is one of the most abundant proteins in PRs [106],[107]. This in turn triggers an increase in the number of lysosomes (Figures 3B,D,F and Figure S5B–C,E), the accumulation of aberrant lysosomes (Figure S5C), and the accumulation of endolysosomal intermediates, including late endosomes (Figure 3B,D,F and Figure S5B,D). Alternatively, loss of the retromer may increase the flux in the endolysosomal pathway, which overpowers the rate of endolysosomal maturation and leads to an adaptive response that eventually leads to the expansion of these compartments. Both pathways can lead to an apparent accumulation of Rh1 in the cell body when stained and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 and Figure S9).\n\nDefective regulation of Rh1 can lead to the demise of PRs via apoptosis [72],[108]. Does apoptosis play a critical role in the PR degeneration in retromer mutants? We argue that this is not the case based on the following observations. First, the retromer mutants exhibit progressive PR degeneration over a 3-wk period (Figure 1B–C, Figure 2B–C, and Figure S1C–E), whereas apoptosis typically occurs within hours [109]. Second, mutants that lead to PR loss via apoptosis lose most PRs within ommatidia by the engulfment of surrounding glial cells [110]. However, the degenerating Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs are not removed, although their morphology is very severely disrupted. Indeed, they can still be identified in 3-wk-old flies (Figure 1D, Figure 2D, Figure 8C, and Figure S1D), indicating a lack of engulfment by surrounding cells [111]. Third, overexpressing p35, a pan-caspase inhibitor of apoptosis [108], fails to suppress the PR degeneration in Vps26 mutants upon light exposure (unpublished data). Indeed, Rh1 accumulation in different subcellular compartments triggers different cellular responses, which leads to PR degeneration of varying severity [2]. Accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal pathway seems particularly toxic to PRs but often does not cause the removal of PRs for many weeks.\n\nLoss of Wg affects eye development [112], whereas loss of Crumbs leads to short and/or fused rhabdomeres [113],[114]. Although the retromer can recycle Wls or Crumbs in some fly tissues [10]–[14],[17],[18], Vps261 or Vps35MH20 mutants do not exhibit obvious eye developmental defects. It is therefore very likely that the composition of the eye retromer is different from the wing retromer. Indeed, loss of Snx3 does not cause obvious degenerative phenotypes when compared to loss of Vps26 or Vps35 (compare Figure S3 with Figures 1 and 2), yet these proteins are all essential for the recycling of Wls and wing development [10]–[14].\n\nThe Retromer in Photosensitive Cells in Flies and Vertebrates\n\nMany players required for phototransduction in Drosophila are conserved in a phototransduction cascade in vertebrate ipRGCs. These include melanopsin, PLC, and the TRP channels [60]–[63]. This phototransduction pathway plays a role in photoentrainment of circadian rhythms [64]–[67] and the control of the pupillary light reflex [64],[68],[69]. We find that vps35 is expressed in 92% of the melanopsin-expressing RGCs in the mouse retina (Figure S11B). This may be an underestimate due to technical difficulties with β-GAL immunostaining in mouse tissues. In addition, the human Vps26 proteins are able to substitute for the function of the fly homolog in PRs (Figure 8A–D). Because vertebrate melanopsin has very similar photochemical properties to fly rhodopsin [115],[116], the retromer may play a conserved role in vertebrate ipRGCs. As deletion of vps35 leads to early embryonic lethality [105], a vps35 conditional KO in ipRGCs will need to be established to address its role in ipRGCs.\n\nImplications of the Retromer Complex in Human Neurodegenerative Diseases\n\nThe retromer has been implicated in human neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and PD [19],[20],[117]. In AD, a retromer deficiency has been proposed to affect subcellular distribution of β-secretase, which leads to increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposits and defective neuronal function [105],[118]. In PD, a missense mutation in VPS35 (D620N) has been shown to cause an autosomal dominant late onset form of the disease [19],[20]. The Vps35 D620N mutant protein appears to function as a dominant negative, and Vps35 and LRRK2 (Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2) have been shown to interact [119]. It will therefore be interesting to assess if these mutants affect ipRGCs as PD patients often have sleep issues [120].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nFly Strains and Genetics\n\nVps261 and Vps262 alleles were isolated as described [6],[78]. Male large duplications (∼1–2 Mb) covering the X chromosome [121] were crossed with female y,w,mut*,P{neoFRT}19Aisogenized flies that were balanced with FM7c,Kr-GAL4,UAS-GFP(Kr&gt;GFP). For the XE52 group, the lethality of alleles was rescued by Dp(1;Y)y267g19.2 (1A1;2B17-18 + 20A3;20Fh). XE52 alleles complemented all the available deficiencies covered by Dp(1;Y)y267g19.2 [122],[123]. Therefore, we turned to cross the XE52 alleles with 80 kb P[acman] duplications that cover the gaps among deficiencies [124] and found three overlapping duplications (Dp(1;3)DC446, Dp(1;3)DC033, and Dp(1;3)DC034) that rescued the lethality of the mutants. These P[acman] duplications share a ∼21 kb interval. We then performed PCR sequencing for genes localized to this region and identified mutations in Vps26. A lethal insertion P{EP}Vps26G2008 in Vps26 failed to complement both XE52 alleles.\n\nRh117 [84], shits1 [81], y,w,GMR-hid,cl,P{neoFRT}19A [125], norpAP24 [65], cm1 [89], w1118 [126], UAS-w RNAi [127], and GMR-w-RNAi13D [128] were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC). Vps35MH20 is a gift from John-Paul Vincent [13]; Snx1d1 and Snxd3 are gifts from Xinhua Lin [10]; UAS-Lamp1::GFP is a gift from Helmut Krämer [95]; and the UAS-GFP RNAi is a gift from Norbert Perrimon [129]. UAS-RNAi stocks against the wash or wls genes were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC). shits1 was used to generate the y,w,Vps261,shits1,P{neoFRT}19A recombinant, whereas the GMR-w-RNAi13D was used to generate the y,w,GMR-w-RNAi13D,P{neoFRT}19A and y,w,Vps261,GMR-w-RNAi13D,P{neoFRT}19A recombinants.\n\nFor ERG, bright field, and TEM experiments, y,w,Vps261,P{neoFRT}19A/FM7c, Kr&gt;GFP, or y,w,Vps262,P{neoFRT}19A/FM7c,Kr&gt;GFP females were crossed with cl(1),P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y),y+,v+ [130]; ey-FLP males, whereas w ; Vps35MH20,P{neoFRT}42D/CyO females were crossed with y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ ; w+,cl,P{neoFRT}42D males. w; Snx1d1, P{neoFRT}FRT40A and w; Snx3d1, P{neoFRT}FRT82B mutants were crossed with y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ; w+,cl,P{neoFRT}40A and y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ; w+,cl, P{neoFRT}82B, respectively. White patches indicate mutant clones. Flies in which at least 90% of the eyes are mutant were examined. To produce clones for controls, homozygous iso were crossed with cl(1),P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y)y+,v+; ey-FLP; y,w; P{neoFRT}42D were crossed with y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ; w+,cl,P{neoFRT}42D; and y,w; P{neoFRT}82B were crossed with y,w,ey-FLP; w+,cl,P{neoFRT}82B. All the flies were raised in constant darkness before experiments. For immunostaining in wing imaginal discs of third instar larvae, y,w,Vps261,P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y)901 males were crossed with ubi-GFP,cl,FRT19A ; hh-GAL4,UAS-FLP [13] females to generate large mutant clones in the posterior region. In eye imaginal discs of third instar larvae, w; Vps35MH20,P{neoFRT}42D/CyO,Kr&gt;GFP [13] females were crossed with y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ; ubi-GFP,cl(2),P{neoFRT}42D.\n\nFor immunostaining, we crossed iso or y,w,Vps261,P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y)901 males with y,w,GMR-hid,cl,P{neoFRT}19A; ey-FLP females to remove w+ wild-type cells in the eyes. To generate Vps261 clones that express Lamp1::GFP, we crossed the y,w,Vps261,GMR-w-RNAi13D,P{neoFRT}19A; actin-GAL4&gt;UAS-Lamp1::GFP females with cl(1),P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y),y+,v+ [130]; ey-FLP males to remove eye pigments that are generated by the mini-w+ markers in the actin-GAL4 and UAS-Lamp1::GFP transgenic constructs.\n\nCrosses were kept in the dark to prevent flies from being exposed to light before experiments. The newly eclosed flies (1 d after eclosion) were used for all the experiments.\n\nFollowing are the genotypes used in our analyses: controls — y,w,P{neoFRT}19A/cl(1),P{neoFRT}19A; ey-FLP/+ ( = iso in Figures 1B–E, 3A, 6, 8A–D, S1B, S5A, S6A, S8, and S10); y,w,P{neoFRT}19A/y,GMR-hid,cl,P{neoFRT}19A; ey-FLP/+ ( = iso in Figure 4A, Figure 4B, top left panel, Figure 4C, top panel, Figure 5A–B,E, Figure S7, and Figure S9); y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ/w; P{neoFRT}42D,Vps35MH20/P{neoFRT}42D,ubi-GFP,cl (GFP positive tissues in Figure 2A); y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ/w; P{neoFRT}42D/P{neoFRT}42D,w+,cl ( = FRT42D in Figure 2B–E); y,w,GMR-w-RNAi13D,P{neoFRT}19A/cl(1),P{neoFRT}19A; ey-FLP/actin-GAL4&gt;UAS-Lamp1::GFP ( = iso in Figure 4B, bottom left panel and Figure 4C, bottom panel); w1118 (Figure 7B–C); w; actin-GAL4/UAS-w RNAi (Figure 7D–G); y,w,Vps261,P{neoFRT}19A/ubi-GFP,cl,P{neoFRT}19A; hh-GAL4&gt;UAS-FLP/+ (GFP positive tissues in Figure S2C–D); y,w,P{neoFRT}19A ( = iso in Figure S2F–G); y,w,ey-FLP,GMR-lacZ/y,w; P{neoFRT}82B/P{neoFRT}82B,w+,cl ( = FRT82B in Figure S3A–B); GMR-GAL4&gt;UAS-w RNAi/UAS-GFP RNAi ( = GMR&gt;GFP RNAi in Figure S4A–C); Rh1-GAL4/UAS-GFP RNAi ( = Rh1&gt;GFP RNAi in Figure S4D–E).

For tissue sections, we fixed fly tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated the tissues with acetone, and embedded them in LR white resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: rabbit anti-Rab5 (abcam), 1∶500; rabbit anti-Avl [84], 1∶500; rabbit anti-Rab7 [76], 1∶500; mouse anti-PDI (abcam), 1∶100; rabbit anti-GM130 (abcam), 1∶500; rabbit anti-Rab11 (abcam, [6]), 1∶500; chicken anti-GFP (abcam), 1∶1,000; mouse anti-Rh1 [4C5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)], 1∶50; mouse anti-Wash (P3H3, [131]), 1∶20; guinea pig anti-Vps26, 1∶1,000 (this study); biotin-conjugated PNA (Vector Labs), 1∶1,000; Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen), 1∶100; and Alexa 405-, Alexa 488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1∶600.\n\nWestern Blotting\n\nFly heads were homogenized in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue samples were loaded into 10% gels, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-actin (ICN Biomedicals), 1∶2,500; mouse anti-Rh1 (4C5, DSHB), 1∶1,000; and rabbit anti-TRP [58].\n\nMolecular Biology\n\nCloning\n\nPrimers 5′-CTTCGGCCGGCCACCATGAATTTCCTGGGATTC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTAGATTAGGTGGAGTCCAGGCCCAGCAGGGGGTTGGGGATGGGCTTGCCATCGGTGGCCAACGGCGTTG-3′ were used to clone the full-length fly Vps26 cDNA from a plasmid (LD29140) obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP). A C′-terminal V5 tag was designed in-frame with Vps26. The Vps26 PCR product and the pUAST-attB vector were digested with EagI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB). T4 ligase (NEB) was used to ligate the fly Vps26 PCR products with pUAST-attB vector. Full-length fly Vps35 cDNA was cloned from a plasmid (SD03023 from BDGP) using primers 5′-CTTCTCGAGGCCACCATGTATCCCTGGAGCTCC-3′ and 5′-TTCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTGAGAGTTATGCCCG-3′. A C-terminal HA tag was added to Vps35. Vps35 PCR product was digested with XhoI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with the pUAST-attB vector. Full-length human vps26A and vps26B were cloned from plasmids (HsCD00296497 and HsCD00076427, respectively) (Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University). The following primers were used for PCR cloning: for hvps26A, 5′-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGTTTTCTTGGAGGCTT-3′ and 5′-GCATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACATTTCAGGCTGTTCGGCAG-3′; for hvps26B, 5′-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGCTTCTTCGGCTTCGG-3′ and 5′-GAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACTGCCTGCAGTTGTTGTCAG-3′. A C-terminal HA tag was added to human vps26 isoforms. PCR products were digested with EcoRI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with pUAST-attB vectors. Fly Vps26::V5 and Vps35::HA and human vps26A::HA and vps26B::HA cDNA constructs were purified and injected into y,w,ΦC31 ; VK33 (fly cDNAs) or y,w,ΦC31 ; VK37 embryos (human cDNAs), and the transgenic flies were selected.\n\nGenomic tagging\n\nRecombineering was performed to tag EGFP at the C-terminus of the Vps26 gene. We used primers 5′-GCAATTACGCCCAATACGAAAAAGACCGGTGCAACGCCGTTGGCCACCGATGCAGCCCAATTCCGATCATATTC-3′ and 5′-GTTACTACTTATCCCCCTGAAGATGGAAATCCTCTCCAGCTTCCCACTCATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′ to amplify a PCR product containing the EGFP tag from the PL452-EGFP template vector [132]. We then electroporated the EGFP-tagged PCR products into DY380 bacteria, which had been previously transformed with a 20 kb P[acman] genomic rescue construct that covers the entire Vps26 genomic locus (clone CH322-92A18 from the BACPAC Resources Center, [133]). Recombineering and related procedures were performed according to the standard protocol [132]. Vps26-gEGFP–tagged genomic construct was injected into y,w,ΦC31 ; VK31 embryos, and the transgenic flies were selected.\n\nGeneration of Anti-Fly Vps26 Antibody\n\nFull-length fly Vps26 cDNA was cloned from LD29140 by PCR with primers 5′-CTTGGATCCATGAATTTCCTGGGATTCGGCCA-3′ and 5′-CTGGCGGCCGCTCAATCGGTGGCCAACGGC-3′. PCR products were then digested with BamHI (NEB) and NotI (NEB) and ligated with a pET28a(+) vector containing a Hisx6 tag at the N′-terminus (Novagen). The Vps26-pET28a(+) construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Invitrogen). Expression of Hisx6-Vps26 was induced with 0.5 mM isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich), and the recombinant protein was purified with a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) and inoculated into guinea pigs to generate polyclonal antibodies (Cocalico Biological Inc.).\n\nLight/Dark Cycle and Blue-Orange Light Exposure\n\nIn general, mosaic flies were grown in the dark at 25°C, and the newly eclosed flies were selected and shifted to a 12-h light/dark cycle (LD, 1,800 lux in the light cycle) or constant darkness (DD) at 25°C for the indicated periods. In the shits suppressor assay, animals were raised in the dark at 18°C to avoid reduced dynamin protein function. Newly eclosed flies were then shifted to 24°C in the dark for 12 h. Flies were then kept in LD or DD at 24°C. For aging experiments, flies were flipped to new vials every 3 d to maintain food conditions, and the positions of the vials were randomly shuffled to normalize light exposure. For pulse-chase assays, flies were kept in a box with a blue LED [6] for 20 min and then an orange LED for 5 min.\n\nLow Vitamin A–Containing Food\n\nLow vitamin A–containing food was made according to [134]. In brief, a solution containing 10% dry yeast, 10% sucrose, 0.02% cholesterol, and 2% agar was microwaved and poured into fly vials. After drying at room temperature overnight, fresh low vitamin A food was used for experiments.\n\nTEM and Bright Field Imaging\n\nTo prepare fly retina samples for TEM and bright field imaging, fly heads were dissected and fixed at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, and 0.005% CaCl2 (PH 7.2) overnight; postfixed in 1% OsO4; dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide; and then embedded in Embed-812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with vacuum attachments. PRs were then sectioned and stained in 4% uranyl acetate and 2.5% lead nitrate. TEM images of PR sections were taken using a JEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope with an AMT XR-16 mid-mount 16 mega-pixel digital camera, while bright field pictures were captured using the Zeiss Imager.Z2 light microscope with an AxioCamMRm digital camera. The morphology and quantity of rhabdomeres, endosomes, and lysosomes were determined in Image J.\n\nERGs\n\nERG recordings were performed as described [6]. Briefly, adult flies were glued to a glass slide, a recording probe was placed on the surface of the eye, and a reference probe was inserted in the thorax. A 1-s flash of white light was given, and the response was recorded and analyzed using the AXON™-pCLAMP®8 software.\n\nMouse Retina cDNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis\n\nMouse retina cDNA was prepared as described [135]. vps26A was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-GAGTTTTCTTGGAGGCTTTTTTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-TTACATCTCAGGCTGCTCCGCAGAGG-3′ and a 30 ng cDNA template. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript by blunt-end ligation and verified by sequencing. DNA probes were generated from gel-purified insert (excised with EcoRI and HindIII) by random-prime labeling with [α-32P]dCTP using the DECAprimeII kit (Ambion). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with a MicroBio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad).\n\nFor Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared from retinas of 3–4-mo-old CD-1 mice by homogenization in TRI reagent (Ambion) using a motorized pestle and passage through a 20-gauge needle, extraction with 1-bromo-3-chloro-propane, and purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). We resolved 10 µg of total RNA on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred it to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) by capillary transfer. Membranes were prehybridized in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for 1 h, then incubated at 42°C overnight with a ∼2.5×107 cpm denatured probe diluted in ULTRAhyb. Blots were washed several times in 2× SSC+0.1% SDS and several times in 0.1× SSC+0.1% SDS. Washes were performed at 42–45°C. For imaging, blots were exposed to a storage phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon (GE Healthcare).\n\nβ-Gal and Melanopsin Detection in Mouse Retina\n\nFor immunohistochemistry, wild-type or vps35 lacZ KI [105] mouse eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min, washed in PBS, then stored overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS. The cornea and lens were removed, and eyecups were embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek) and flash-frozen. Cryosectioned retina were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 10 min and stained with the indicated antibodies: chicken anti–β-GAL (abcam, 1∶1,000) and rabbit α-melanopsin (Advanced Targeting Systems, 1∶5,000). Alexa 488- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1∶600) were used for immunostaining. Images were captured using the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and analyzed using the Image J software.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nTwo-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze experimental results.\n\nSupporting Information"
