  "fullText": "Notice of republication\n\nThis article was republished on 2nd December 2019, to correct errors in analysis that led to each pixel in Fig 4 displaying the number of species not impacted by at least one threat, rather than the number of species that were not impacted by any threats.\n\nThis error subsequently affected the section entitled “Proportion of species impacted” and so species richness was overestimated, resulting in the values in Fig 5 also being incorrect.\n\nThe following files have been reproduced, in light of the errors above:\n\nFig 4, Fig 5, S4-S6 Figs, S3-S5 Tables.\n\nPlease download this article again to view the correct version. The originally published, uncorrected article is provided here for reference.\n\nSupporting information"
