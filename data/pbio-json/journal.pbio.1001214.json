  "abstract": "Comparison of human, chimpanzee, and macaque brain transcriptomes reveals a significant developmental remodeling in the human prefrontal cortex, potentially shaped by microRNA.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nIn multicellular organisms, the evolution of novel characteristics frequently involves gene expression change [1]. Nearly four decades ago, it was hypothesized that the evolution of the human brain could similarly be driven by expression changes [2]. In support of this, early comparative studies of adult human, chimpanzee, and macaque transcriptomes reported more human-specific expression changes than chimpanzee-specific changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain, but no such imbalance in other tissues such as blood, liver, or heart [3],[4]. Several studies further associated these expression differences with neuron-specific functions [5]–[7], and a recent analysis of the human, chimpanzee, and macaque PFC transcriptomes reported more human-specific than chimpanzee-specific changes in developmental timing [8].\n\nTogether, these studies suggest that the human brain transcriptome has evolved at an accelerated rate compared to that of the chimpanzee, possibly reflecting the accelerated rate of human cognitive evolution. Despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, the ontogenetic and tissue-specific properties of this phenomenon have yet to be investigated. For instance, whether human brain transcriptome acceleration involves species differences that are constitutive across lifespan, or differences in how ontogenesis proceeds, is unclear. In addition, as most existing transcriptome comparisons studied a single brain region, we do not know whether different brain regions exhibit the same rate and kind of evolutionary acceleration. Finally, the molecular basis of human brain transcriptome acceleration, such as the contribution of cis- and trans-events [9], also remains unknown.\n\nIn the present study we analyzed prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellar cortex (CBC) transcriptomes in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques of different ages. Both the PFC and CBC are brain regions potentially involved in human-specific behaviors. The cerebellum is important for motor function and memory and has been implicated in human language [10], while the PFC is associated with such functions as abstract thinking, planning, social intelligence, and working memory [11]. Using a number of datasets, we found that two types of divergence, both expression differences that are constitutive throughout lifespan as well as expression differences involving changes in developmental patterns, have contrasting functional and evolutionary properties. The accelerated evolution of human brain expression appears to mainly involve remodeling of developmental patterns, which may in turn be shaped by microRNA (miRNA) expression changes. Moreover, this acceleration is not uniform across the human brain and is particularly pronounced in the PFC.\n\n      Results\n      \nUsing Affymetrix microarrays we measured mRNA expression in the PFC and CBC of 12 to 26 individuals per species. The individual ages varied across a large portion of the species' lifespan, although most samples were chosen from the early postnatal period (Table S1; Figure S1A). Across the approximately 12,000 genes detected in either brain region, species differences could explain approximately 45% of total expression variation, while age could explain 30% (Figure S1B–C). Both effects were also manifest in principle component analyses (Figure 1A), and were highly reproducible upon comparison with published gene expression datasets (Figure S2).\n\nIn each brain region and species, we identified genes showing significant expression changes across the lifespan as well as genes showing significant expression divergence among species, using polynomial regression models and analysis of covariance, respectively (p&lt;0.001, false discovery rate &lt;10%). We then classified genes showing significant species divergence into the following three types (Figure 1B): type I, constant expression across lifespan; type II, variable expression across lifespan, no developmental pattern differences among species; type III, variable expression across lifespan and developmental pattern differences among species (developmental remodeling). We identified approximately 1,000–3,000 genes in each category, with type II being the most common and type III the rarest (Figure 1C, Table S2).\n\n        Human Developmental Expression Patterns Show Accelerated Evolution\n        \nWe estimated the expression divergence among species by calculating distances between species' expression-age trajectories and constructing neighbor joining trees (Materials and Methods). We found that the expression divergence in genes showing constant expression or no developmental pattern changes (type I and II), i.e. constitutive divergence, reflected the three species' known phylogenetic relationship (Figure 1D–E). Furthermore, human and chimpanzee branch lengths (which represent divergence on the respective lineages) for type I and type II genes were comparable, with average ratios of the human to chimpanzee branch lengths ranging between 1.0 and 1.6 (Table S3). Thus, the evolutionary rate of constitutive expression divergence roughly reflects the divergence between the two species from their common ancestor.\n\nBy contrast, when we studied species divergence in the shape of developmental trajectories among genes that underwent developmental remodeling (type III), we found markedly different results. In the PFC, the human branch was on average 5.2±0.7 times longer than the chimpanzee branch (Figure 1D–E, Table S3). The human branch was even 1.2±0.1 times longer than the “macaque” branch representing divergence between the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees and contemporary macaques. If gene expression was evolving in a similar way to genomic sequence, the human branch would be expected to be approximately seven times shorter compared to this “macaque” branch [12]. In the CBC, the median human-chimpanzee branch length ratio was 3.5±0.5. Thus, in the CBC, developmental pattern divergence was also significantly greater on the human versus the chimpanzee evolutionary lineage, but to a significantly less extent than in the PFC (p&lt;10−8). These results indicate that, while humans and chimpanzees evolved at similar rates with respect to constitutive expression differences, human developmental patterns have become highly differentiated from both chimpanzee and macaque developmental patterns, with 1.5- to 2-fold greater acceleration in the PFC.\n\nWe performed a number of analyses to test the validity of this conclusion, including (a) sub-sampling to equalize mean expression level distributions across the three gene types; (b) selecting the same number of individuals per species, with similar age-distributions across species' lifespan; (c) comparing the numbers of species-specific genes identified by the F test, as an alternative to our expression distance measure; (d) controlling for life-history differences among species, such as prolonged childhood and longer lifespan in humans [13]; and (e) repeating mRNA expression measurements in newborn and young adult pooled samples from each species by sequencing RNA with the Illumina platform (Text S1).\n\nThe excess of human developmental pattern divergence was found to be significant across all tests (Figure S3B–D, Table S3). Importantly, despite the limited sample size of the RNA-sequencing dataset, type III genes showed significantly more human-specific expression changes compared with the other two types in both brain regions (p&lt;0.001; Figure S4) and this excess was significantly higher in the PFC than in the CBC (p&lt;0.001). Considered together, these results indicate that the accelerated pace of developmental remodeling on the human evolutionary lineage is not caused by sampling or technical biases, and cannot be explained by life-history differences among species.\n\n        Genes Showing Developmental Pattern Divergence Are Neuron-Related and Evolutionarily Conserved\n        \nCould the accelerated evolution of brain developmental patterns on the human lineage reflect adaptive changes underlying human cognitive evolution? To address this possibility, we investigated the functional properties of type I, II, and III genes. Using the Gene Ontology [14] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases [15], we detected significant enrichment of PFC type III genes in neuron-related functional processes, including “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction” and “behavior” (Table S4, p&lt;0.05). CBC type III genes did not show significant associations with neural functions, but were enriched in more general processes such as “response to hormone stimulus” and “response to hypoxia,” while type I genes were enriched in mRNA processing and splicing-related processes in both brain regions. Type II genes showed no significant functional associations. Further, with respect to expression breadth, type III genes showed the greatest tissue-specificity, and significantly overlapped with neuron-related genes, but not glia-enriched genes (Figure 2A, Figure S5). In contrast, expression breadth was significantly above the genome average for type I genes and close to average for type II genes, with no significant enrichment among neuron- or glia-specific genes for either gene type (Figure 2A). Notably, PFC genes associated with neural function through Gene Ontology had ∼1.5 times larger human-chimpanzee branch ratios than non-neural type III genes (p&lt;0.002). In accordance with the general conservation of neuron-related genes [16], regulatory and coding sequences of type III genes, but not the other gene sets, were significantly conserved compared to all genes expressed in the brain (Figure 2B). Overall, developmental remodeling in the PFC showed a clear association with brain-specific functional processes, while no such association could be detected for the other divergence types.\n\n        Cis-Regulation of Gene Expression Divergence\n        \nWe next examined the possible mechanisms underlying PFC expression divergence for the three gene types. Expression divergence could be caused either by cis-changes that accumulate in regulatory regions over time and tend to affect each gene independently, or by altered expression, or function, of a few trans-regulators affecting the expression of hundreds of genes in a coordinated manner. To determine which mechanism played the more dominant role in human expression evolution, we first tested the correlation between gene expression divergence and sequence divergence in cis-regulatory regions on the human, chimpanzee, and macaque evolutionary lineages. To this end we analyzed the proximal promoter, the 3′UTR, and putative enhancer regions, using Ensembl [17] gene annotation, as well as regions defined using histone modification data derived from human cell lines [18] or human and mouse brain tissue (Materials and Methods) [19],[20].\n\nOn the macaque lineage, which contained the greatest number of sequence changes, we detected a significant positive correlation between promoter sequence divergence and expression divergence for the type I and type II genes (rho∼0.10, p&lt;0.05, Table S5). Similarly, we detected a significant and positive correlation between human-specific promoter sequence divergence and human-specific expression divergence across the type I genes, and a positive correlation trend for type II genes (Figure 2C). However, we found no significant correlations between promoter divergence and expression divergence on the chimpanzee lineage, or for the type III genes on any lineage (Table S5). This observation may be due to the paucity of species-specific mutations resulting in insufficient power in our tests. To overcome this limitation, we tested correlations between regulatory region sequence divergence across mammalian species (pan-mammalian) and species-specific expression divergence. For type III genes, both macaque- and chimpanzee-specific expression divergence correlated significantly and positively with pan-mammalian regulatory sequence divergence. Notably, human-specific expression divergence did not correlate positively with pan-mammalian regulatory sequence divergence, but showed a significant negative correlation, albeit marginally (Figure 2D). In other words, whereas regulatory regions of type III genes diverging on the macaque and chimpanzee lineages are less conserved, those diverging on the human lineage are more conserved. This trend of positive association between type III expression divergence and sequence divergence in chimpanzees and macaques, and negative association in humans, was also observed in 3′UTR and enhancer regions (Figure 2D, Table S5). Thus, the expression divergence of type I and II genes on all evolutionary lineages, as well as the divergence of type III genes on the chimpanzee and macaque lineages, may well be linked to sequence divergence in cis-regulatory regions. By contrast, type III expression divergence (developmental remodeling) on the human evolutionary lineage does not reveal any such trend. This suggests that mutation accumulation in cis-regulatory regions might not have been the major contributor to the extensive remodeling of the developmental expression patterns observed in the human PFC.\n\nThe cis- and trans-expression divergence mechanisms can also be indirectly discerned through their tissue-specificity. While mutations in cis-regions tend to affect multiple tissues, trans-factor-driven changes tend to be more tissue-specific [21]. Indeed, we found constitutive divergence (type I and II genes) to be highly correlated between PFC and CBC in all three species, while developmental pattern divergence (type III genes) showed no such correlation (Figure 2E, Figure S6). This result further supports the notion that constitutive divergence (type I and II) is driven largely by changes in cis-elements, but this is not the case for developmental pattern divergence in the human PFC.\n\n        MicroRNA Contribute to Human-Specific Developmental Pattern Divergence\n        \nWe hypothesized that type III divergence and, in particular, human-specific developmental pattern divergence in the PFC could be driven by trans-factors. In support of this notion, we found that type III genes, in comparison to the other gene sets, carry a higher density of predicted miRNA and transcription factor (TF) binding sites [22],[23] in their regulatory regions, even when accounting for conservation level differences among genes (Figure 3A). We next considered whether trans-regulators, specifically TFs and miRNAs, also show an increased divergence in developmental patterns on the human lineage. For this, we used expression profiles for 105 TFs from mRNA microarray data that had target prediction information. In addition, we measured expression of ∼200 miRNAs in the PFC and CBC of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, in 7 to 12 individuals of different age per species, using Agilent microarrays (Figure 3B, Figure S7A). We found that although TFs showed comparable human divergence to other genes, for 19 PFC-expressed type III miRNAs the median branch length was 24 times longer for humans than for chimpanzees (Figure 3C–D). This effect was stable after correcting for life-history differences among species (Table S3). By contrast, the median human-chimpanzee branch ratio based on 15 CBC-expressed type III miRNAs was found to equal 3.9. Thus, miRNAs in the PFC show an even greater excess of human-specific developmental remodeling than other transcripts. Despite the limited power of available target prediction algorithms, we also detected greater human-chimpanzee branch ratios among predicted targets of type III TF and type III miRNAs compared to non-target genes (p&lt;0.05; Figure 3D). Hence, evolutionary changes in these trans-regulator expression trajectories could underlie the excess of developmental pattern divergence in the human PFC.\n\nFocusing on PFC type III genes, we next directly tested possible associations between regulators and predicted target genes. We found a significant excess of negative correlations between miRNAs and their predicted targets' expression profiles (r&lt;−0.9, p&lt;10−6; Figure 3E), consistent with the inhibitory role of miRNAs on expression. For TFs, we observed a modest excess of positive correlations (r&gt;0.9, p = 0.08; Table S6). As variation in expression profiles reflects both age effects and species differences, we also calculated regulator-target correlations based only on species' expression differences across the lifespan. Again, in the PFC, species differences in miRNA expression showed a significantly negative association with differences in their predicted targets' profiles (Figure 3F, Table S6).\n\nTo estimate the effect of miRNA regulation on developmental pattern divergence in the PFC, we searched for miRNAs with significant target site enrichment among PFC type III genes. Screening all 157 expressed miRNAs using TargetScan predictions [23], we detected 39 miRNAs with significantly more predicted targets among PFC type III genes than among other gene sets (p&lt;0.05). Importantly, detection of only five miRNAs would be expected by chance (permutation test p&lt;0.001). Of the 39 miRNAs identified, 12 showed an excess of negative correlations with their type III targets, compared to the 118 miRNAs with no target enrichment in PFC type III genes (one-sided binomial test p&lt;0.05; Table S7, Table S8). The 140 target genes associated with these miRNAs constitute approximately 10% of the developmental remodeling events identified in the PFC. Notably, the majority of these miRNAs (90%), as well as their targets (89%), showed more divergence in humans than chimpanzees.\n\n        Experimental Validation of miRNA-Target Relationships\n        \nTo validate some of the predicted miRNA regulatory effects, we conducted an additional set of experiments with the miRNAs miR-92a, miR-454, and miR-320b. These miRNAs showed not only significant enrichment of predicted targets among type III genes, but also the strongest excess of negative correlations with their predicted targets in our analyses (Figure 4). At the same time, even though these miRNAs have been associated with malignancies [24] and angiogenesis [25] in the brain, to our knowledge, none of them have yet been implicated in brain developmental regulation.\n\nFirst, we directly tested predicted miRNA-target associations by transfecting two human neuroblastoma cell lines with miRNA constructs containing mature sequences for the three miRNAs (Materials and Methods). The regulatory effects were determined by comparing gene expression in cell lines transfected with miRNA constructs or transfected with negative controls, using Affymetrix microarrays. In all cases, we detected a strong inhibitory effect of the miRNA on target genes predicted by TargetScan [23], compared to non-target genes (Figure 5A, Figure S8). We also found that genes inhibited in the miRNA transfection experiment, irrespective of TargetScan annotation, showed a trend of negative associations with miRNA expression in our time series dataset (Figure 5B–C). Thus, based on miRNA targets experimentally identified in neuroblastoma cell lines, we confirmed the validity of TargetScan predictions used in our computational analysis, and directly demonstrated negative associations between miRNA expression and the expression of their type III target genes.\n\nWe then asked whether the verified type III target genes of the three miRNAs, i.e. the targets predicted by TargetScan that showed negative correlations in our time series and expression inhibition in the transfection experiments, might also be associated with particular functions and/or cell types. We found that targets of all three miRNAs were neuron-related when compared to other miRNA targets (p&lt;0.05 in each case, Figure 5D). Furthermore, targets of two out of the three miRNAs tested, miR-454 (n = 18) and miR-92a (n = 20), showed enrichment in the same KEGG term: “calcium signaling” pathway (Figure 5E, Table S9). This is noteworthy, since miR-454 and miR-92a do not share common targets except for one gene, and finding such a functional overlap between two such miRNA target sets is unlikely (p = 0.021). Intriguingly, calcium signaling is a major biological processes involved in neuronal plasticity [26],[27], implying a role of miR-92a and miR-454 in regulating genes associated with neurodevelopmental plasticity.\n\nIn a second experiment, we investigated the histological expression patterns of miR-320b, the miRNA showing the strongest enrichment in neuron-related genes (Figure 5D). By means of in situ hybridizations with an LNA-containing probe complementary to the mature sequence of this miRNA in human and macaque prefrontal cortex sections (Materials and Methods), we found that miR-320b preferentially co-localized with neurons in both species (Figure 6). These results are consistent with the proposed regulatory relationship between this miRNA and its neuron-related target genes.\n\n      Discussion\n      \n        Constitutive and Developmental Pattern Divergence Exhibit Distinct Characteristics\n        \nOur analysis marks constitutive divergence (represented by type I and II genes) as the most dominant form of expression difference among species. In the primate brain, 85%–90% of genes showing significant expression divergence between humans and chimpanzees fall within this category. Expanding our analysis to a published brain transcriptome time series from two mouse species (Mus musculus and Mus spretus) [8], 99% of genes with significant expression divergence can be classified as showing constitutive expression divergence.\n\nConstitutive expression divergence affects the two brain regions analyzed in a similar manner. Genes showing constitutive divergence tend to have high expression breadth, show no association with tissue-specific functions, and their regulatory sequences evolve as fast as, or faster than, those of other genes. Notably, humans and chimpanzees show approximately equal levels of constitutive divergence in both brain regions studied. Thus, while some constitutive expression differences may underlie adaptive changes in primate brain evolution, the majority could represent transcriptomic drift [28], driven by mutations in cis-regulatory regions, and affecting multiple tissues. This result supports a previously proposed transcriptome evolution model, in which a large portion of expression divergence among species is shaped by cis-changes [29].\n\nDevelopmental pattern divergence (type III genes), as identified in this study, shows a very different evolutionary mode. First, this is the least frequent divergence type, with less than 15% of genes differentially expressed between human, chimpanzee, and macaque brains showing developmental pattern differences. This might be expected given the general conservation of developmental expression trajectories among primates (Figure S2) [8]. Second, developmental pattern divergence differs substantially between the two brain regions analyzed, PFC and CBC. Third, developmental pattern differences found in the PFC are associated with neurons and neuronal functions. Fourth, in contrast to type I and II genes, type III genes have highly conserved regulatory and coding sequences. Furthermore, human-specific developmental pattern divergence in PFC shows negative correlation with cis-regulatory changes. This is striking, given that evolutionary expression divergence, including both quantitative and developmental pattern differences, is generally positively associated with regulatory and/or coding divergence [9],[29]–[32]. These results support a scenario, where tissue-specific changes in the expression of trans-regulators, such as miRNA, rather than sequence changes in cis-regulatory regions, are the driving force underlying developmental remodeling across hundreds of genes.\n\n        A Role for miRNAs in Shaping Developmental Divergence among Species\n        \nWhile divergence in transcription factor expression and activity has been shown to underlie evolutionary divergence in various contexts (e.g., [33],[34]), relatively little is known about the role of miRNA in transcriptome evolution. It is, therefore, of note that the strongest trans-regulatory signal associated with developmental pattern divergence in the primate brain could be associated with miRNAs rather than with TFs. The regulatory effects of the top three miRNAs identified by computational predictions could be further supported by cell line transfections and in situ hybridization experiments. Our analysis further implicates two of these miRNAs in the regulation of genes involved in the calcium signaling pathway in neurons. Given the role played by calcium signaling in neuronal plasticity [26],[27], this result raises the possibility that the observed human-specific developmental expression patterns in the PFC could underlie human-specific cognitive functions such as learning and memory. It would be interesting to test miR-454 and miR-92a as potential regulators of neurodevelopmental plasticity in vivo.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of the miRNA experimental results is the spatial expression patterns identified by in situ hybridization. These indicate substantial variation among neurons in the miRNAs' expression (Figure 6), raising the possibility that the identified miRNAs are specific to different neuron subpopulations. Differential miRNA activity among species may thus contribute to brain organization differences, which have been suggested as a major distinction between human and chimpanzee brains [35].\n\nMeanwhile, our work has a number of limitations. First, as our main analysis is based on human microarrays, we exclude any probes that do not match each of the three species' genomes perfectly and uniquely (Materials and Methods). Thus, we ignore regions that show copy number variation among species, or are species-specific. Likewise, our analysis is restricted to regulators conserved across the three species. This is important, because fast evolving or human-specific genes, TFs [36], or miRNAs [37] may have significant contributions to the evolution of primate brain development and species divergence [38]. Second, when analyzing the effects of cis-regulation on expression divergence, we are constrained by the limited annotation of cis-regulatory regions, and it is conceivable that mutations in a yet unidentified class of neural enhancers drive a substantial portion of developmental pattern divergence in humans. Third, our study is restricted to species differences in postnatal development. This is a critical period in brain ontogeny, when multiple processes, including synaptic maturation and myelination, take place [39]. Accordingly, expression differences in this period can readily generate phenotypic differences between species. Meanwhile, human-specific expression changes in earlier developmental stages could have at least as strong effects on the brain phenotype [40]. The evolution of fetal brain gene expression remains to be studied.\n\nDespite these limitations, our results extend earlier observations on accelerated evolution of gene expression in the human brain. Specifically, we show that compared with chimpanzees and macaques, humans exhibit extreme developmental remodeling in the PFC and, to a lesser extent, in the CBC. Accelerated divergence of human developmental patterns cannot be explained by neutral drift, and cannot be attributed to life-history differences among species. Mechanistically, these human-specific changes appear driven by changes in expression of trans-acting regulators, and specifically miRNA, rather than accumulation of cis-regulatory mutations. Assuming a link between gene expression pattern divergence and phenotypic changes in the human brain, these results suggest that our cognitive abilities might be traced to a handful of key regulatory changes that remodeled cortical development.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Sample Collection\n        \nWe collected prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellar cortex (CBC) samples from postmortem brains of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaque individuals of different ages (Table S1). Human samples were obtained from the NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the University of Maryland (USA), the Netherlands Brain Bank (Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and the Chinese Brain Bank Center (Wuhan, China); chimpanzee samples from the Yerkes Primate Center (Georgia, USA), the Anthropological Institute &amp; Museum of the University of Zürich-Irchel (Switzerland), and the Biomedical Primate Research Centre (the Netherlands); and the macaque samples from the Suzhou Experimental Animal Center (China). All subjects were healthy and had suffered sudden deaths. Informed consent for use of human tissues for research was obtained in writing from all donors or their next of kin. All non-human primates used in this study suffered sudden deaths for reasons other than their participation in this study, and without any relation to the tissue used. Detailed information on sample sources can be found in Text S1.\n\n        Gene Expression Experiments\n        \nFor details of experimental methods and quality assessment, see Text S1. For mRNA profiling we used postmortem brains of a total of 33 human (aged 0–98 years), 14 chimpanzee (aged 0–44 years), and 34 rhesus macaque individuals (aged 0–28 years). Total RNA extracted from 100 mg of dissected CBC and PFC samples (humans, n = 22/23; chimpanzees, n = 12/12; macaques, n = 24/26, respectively; Table S1) was hybridized to Affymetrix Gene1.0 ST human microarrays following standard protocols. Data analysis was conducted using probes matching all three species' genomes perfectly and uniquely, as determined using BLAT [41]. MicroRNA expression was measured among 14 humans, 11 chimpanzees, and 8 macaques using the Agilent Human microRNA Microarray (v3), containing probes for 866 human microRNAs. As the miRNA microarray probes are designed based on human mature miRNA sequences, we removed miRNA showing any sequence difference in their mature sequences, using BLAT [41] and aligning mapped sequences by ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2). Five hundred human miRNA showing 100% conservation across the three species were included. Only samples with &gt;200 detected miRNA were used. In total, 8 human, 11 chimpanzee, and 8 macaque PFC samples and 12 human, 7 chimpanzee, and 7 macaque CBC samples were retained. Only miRNAs that could be detected in &gt;50% of samples per species were used. All microarray gene expression datasets were log2 transformed and quantile normalized. RNA-sequencing was conducted in pooled samples from newborn and young adults from the three species in each brain region, using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II system. Chimpanzee and rhesus macaque gene annotations were constructed from human gene annotation using the UCSC “Liftover” tool (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver). Gene annotations were filtered to only include transcripts with a similar size in all three species. Transcript expression levels were calculated using “Cufflinks” (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/), based on “Tophat” mapping of conserved exons [42]. The mRNA microarray datasets are available at NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (accession number GSE22570). The miRNA datasets have been submitted to NCBI GEO (accession number GSE29356) and are available in processed form at the following locations for PFC and CBC, respectively: http://www.picb.ac.cn/Comparative/data_methods/data_ms_mirna_age_pfc_2011.txt and http://www.picb.ac.cn/Comparative/data_methods/data_ms_mirna_age_cbc_2011.txt.\n\nThe processed RNA-sequencing datasets are available at the following locations for PFC and CBC, respectively: http://www.picb.ac.cn/Comparative/data_methods/age_divergence_2010/rnaseq_hcm_PFC1.txt and http://www.picb.ac.cn/Comparative/data_methods/age_divergence_2010/rnaseq_hcm_CBC1.txt.\n\n        Statistical Tests\n        \nFor detailed descriptions of the tests applied, justifications of statistics, and detailed results, see Text S1. We used polynomial regression to model expression changes with age (age-test) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to model species differences (differential expression test). In both tests, we fit data to families of models including linear, quadratic, and/or cubic terms [8],[43]. The F test was used to assess significance. We used a log2-age scale to model expression changes with age. When indicated, we also used ages transformed using linear models of life-history landmarks in order to normalize life-history differences among species. For identifying developmental pattern divergence among species, we used the ANCOVA test on datasets where mean (constitutive) expression differences among species had been subtracted, such that the only remaining difference was differences in trajectory shapes. False discovery rates were estimated by permuting individuals' age or species identity. Confidence ranges for the median ratio reported in the text indicate 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. In the RNA-sequencing experiment, genes were binary coded to show higher divergence in human or chimpanzee lineages; we therefore used the binomial test to compare distributions between gene sets. We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparing log2-transformed human-to-chimpanzee branch length ratio distributions between the two gene sets, testing for a median &gt;0 in the distribution. For testing enrichment of a gene set in functional categories or among targets of regulators, we used the hypergeometric test. In functional analyses the p values were corrected using the Bonferroni method. We used Spearman rank correlation for comparing sequence and expression divergence estimates. For identifying candidate miRNAs regulating specific gene expression patterns, we used the approach described in [44]. Briefly, we first test an association between targets of each miRNA and a gene set showing a particular gene expression pattern, using the hypergeometric test. Second, we test if the significantly enriched miRNAs show a higher frequency of negative correlations (Pearson r&lt;−0.75) with their targets in the gene set, compared to the mean frequency for miRNAs without enrichment in the gene set. The frequencies were compared using the binomial test. The negative correlations were calculated by (a) using interpolated points from spline curves fit to the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, using all three species together, and (b) calculating differences between species' curves at interpolated points, for miRNA and mRNA, using all three pairs of differences (Text S1). For comparing expression change distributions and correlation distributions for Figure 5A–C, we used one-sided Wilcoxon tests.\n\n        Definition of the Three Divergence Types\n        \nType I, constitutive divergence among constant genes: genes showing constant expression (age-test p&gt;0.01 in all three species) and constitutive divergence across lifespan (differential expression test p&lt;0.001 in at least one pair of species). Type II, constitutive divergence among developmental genes: genes showing age-related change (age-test p&lt;0.001 in minimum one species) and constitutive divergence across lifespan (differential expression test p&lt;0.001 in at least one pair of species), but no evidence for developmental pattern divergence (pattern divergence test p&gt;0.01 in all species comparisons). Type III, divergence in developmental patterns: genes showing developmental regulation (age-test p&lt;0.001 in at least one species) and differences in developmental expression patterns among species (both differential expression test and pattern divergence test p&lt;0.001 in at least one pair of species).\n\n        Expression Divergence Estimates\n        \nTo estimate expression divergence, we first reduced the influence of individual variation within a species by fitting expression trajectories to each species' data points, for each gene independently. We next calculated Euclidean distances among these trajectories and constructed neighbor joining trees based on these distances (Text S1). Finally, expression divergence on each lineage was estimated as the length of the corresponding neighbor joining tree branch. Importantly, for type III genes we removed average expression level differences among species from the expression divergence calculation. Therefore, our estimates of expression divergence for type III genes purely reflect developmental pattern differences among species (Figure 1B).\n\n        Processing of TF and miRNA Datasets\n        \nThe TF expression profiles were obtained from the Affymetrix arrays. For the average TF expression divergence patterns shown in Figure 3C–D, we used all 1,071 genes annotated within the Gene Ontology category “transcription factor activity” (GO:0003700). Using alternative definitions, such as the list described in [45], or restricting the analysis to TFs annotated in TRANSFAC yielded similar results (unpublished data). miRNA profiles were measured using Agilent arrays and processed as described above.\n\n        TF and miRNA Target Predictions\n        \nThe procedure to define conserved human miRNA and TFBS target sites is described in [44]. For miRNA target prediction we used the Conserved Site Context Score Table from TargetScan (v5.0) [23]. We identified conserved TF binding sites (TFBS) in proximal promoters (±2,000 b.p. around the transcription start site) for each Ensembl human gene (v54), using the Match algorithm which uses binding site matrices from the TRANSFAC database (v11.2) [22]. We chose TFBS with average Phastcons scores ≥0.6 using the 17-way vertebrate Conserved Element Table [46]. TFBS were linked to transcription factor genes using two paths described in Text S1, which resulted in 426 TFBS mapped to ≥1 gene that were annotated with “transcription factor activity” (GO:0003700). For the analysis presented in Figure 3A, we removed the overall sequence conservation effect on BS density, using residuals from linear regressions between TFBS/miRNA-BS density and promoter/3′UTR mean Phastcons scores, respectively.\n\n        Functional Analyses\n        \nFor functional pathway analyses, we used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation [15] and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation [14] for humans. To estimate expression breadth per gene we used cell type information from the GNF dataset available from Ensembl (v54) [17]. For estimating the neural-enrichment per gene, we used a mouse cell type-specific gene expression experiment with expression profiles containing the terms “neuron,” “axon,” and “synapse” [47]. In addition, we used all genes containing the terms “neuron,” “axon,” and “synapse” in GO. Data were preprocessed as described in [44]. See Text S1 for details.\n\n        Sequence Divergence Estimates\n        \nFor estimating pan-mammalian regulatory site conservation, we used the mean Phastcons 18-way Placental Mammal Conservation Track [46] values. Mean scores were calculated for (a) proximal promoters and (b) 3′UTRs based on Ensembl (v54) annotation; (c) proximal promoters defined by H3K4me3 marks in a human PFC age-series ChIP-Seq experiment, combining all 14 samples together and choosing peaks with posterior possibility ≥0.95 [19]; (d) putative enhancer sites based on the presence of H3K4me1 “broad” peaks, presence of DNAseI hypersensitive sites, and the absence of H3K4me3 “broad” peaks (which is a promoter mark) identified in the Encode project, in an epithelial cell line (Hmec) (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/) [18] and assigned to nearest human Ensembl gene within 100 kb; (e) putative enhancer sites defined similar to (d) but showing peaks in a minimum of three cell lines among the seven main cell lines used in the Encode project; and (f) putative enhancer sites bound by the transcriptional activator CBP in a mouse brain ChIP-Seq experiment [20]. For estimating species-specific mutations for each of these regions, we extracted the corresponding regions from the human (hg18) genome, projected these onto chimpanzee (panTro2) and rhesus macaque (rheMac2) genomes using “Liftover,” and aligned the corresponding sequences with MUSCLE (v3.7, http://www.drive5.com/muscle). As inflated mutation estimates can arise due to homology or genome alignment problems, we removed the 5% upper fraction of mutation estimates. In Figure 2A–B, the variables (divergence or cell type specificity) were scaled by subtracting the average value across all expressed genes in the tissue, to represent deviation from the transcriptome average. To improve visualization within the same barplot, each variable was also further rescaled by multiplying with a constant.\n\n        Cell Line Transfections\n        \nConstruct sequences used and the details of the transfection experiment are provided in Text S1. Briefly, we transfected two human neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH, with three miRNA constructs containing mature sequences for miR-92a, miR-454, and miR-320b, based on miRBase [48], as well as two negative controls. Cells were incubated in DMEM (Hyclone) + 10% FBS (Hyclone) medium and transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) standard protocol (Text S1). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HG U133Plus2.0 arrays following standard protocols. Microarray expression data were processed as described above for other datasets. Expression levels for the negative control-transfected cell lines were subtracted from the expression of miRNA-transfected cell line, for each miRNA and cell line type separately, yielding a measure of miRNA effect size. For Figure 5A, we calculated the mean effect size per gene per miRNA across the two cell lines. Treating each cell line separately, as well as together, gave us significant results, and targets verified in each cell line (i.e. TargetScan targets that show inhibition upon transfection) also showed significant overlap (Figure S8).\n\n        In Situ Hybridizations\n        \nHybridizations were performed following [49], and details can be found in Text S1. Briefly, tissue sections were collected on Superfrost/plus slides (Fisher). Tissue was fixed with formaldehyde and subsequently treated with proteinase K [50]. After washing by PBS, sections were acetylated and incubated in humidified bioassay trays for prehybridization at 50°C for 4 h in hybridization buffer [49],[51]. This was followed by an overnight hybridization step using the DIG-labeled LNA oligonucleotide probes complementary to the target miRNAs. Sections were rinsed at 50°C and washed multiple times in SSC buffer. The in situ signal was detected by incubation with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-DIG antibody, using NBT/BCIP as substrate.\n\n      Supporting Information"
