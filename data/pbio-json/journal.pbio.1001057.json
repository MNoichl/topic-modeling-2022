  "abstract": "Cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) have a reciprocal synapse that\n                    underlies lateral inhibition and establishes the antagonistic center-surround\n                    organization of the visual system. Cones transmit to HCs through an excitatory\n                    synapse and HCs feed back to cones through an inhibitory synapse. Here we report\n                    that HCs also transmit to cone terminals a positive feedback signal that\n                    elevates intracellular Ca2+ and accelerates neurotransmitter\n                    release. Positive and negative feedback are both initiated by AMPA receptors on\n                    HCs, but positive feedback appears to be mediated by a change in HC\n                        Ca2+, whereas negative feedback is mediated by a change in\n                    HC membrane potential. Local uncaging of AMPA receptor agonists suggests that\n                    positive feedback is spatially constrained to active HC-cone synapses, whereas\n                    the negative feedback signal spreads through HCs to affect release from\n                    surrounding cones. By locally offsetting the effects of negative feedback,\n                    positive feedback may amplify photoreceptor synaptic release without sacrificing\n                    HC-mediated contrast enhancement.",
  "fullText": "Introduction\n      \nThe retina is an exceptionally approachable part of the brain, hence deciphering the\n                retinal neural circuit was one of the earliest triumphs of systems neuroscience\n                    [1]. The\n                basic wiring diagram of the retina was determined largely from electrical recordings\n                from each of the main neuronal cell types. Synaptic connections were first deduced\n                by examining how the light response is transformed from one retinal cell type to the\n                next [2]. Paired\n                recordings from different cell types and anatomical and pharmacological studies\n                confirmed the occurrence of these connections and helped define their functional\n                properties.\n\nThe synaptic connection between HCs and cone photoreceptors attracted particular\n                interest right from the beginning [3],[4]. Voltage changes in HCs result in sign-inverted voltage\n                changes in cone photoreceptors, a negative feedback connection. HCs project\n                laterally in the retina over hundreds of microns and integrate inputs from many rods\n                and cones, so negative feedback causes cones [3] and rods [5] to have an antagonistic\n                center-surround receptive field. This receptive field organization is reflected\n                postsynaptically first in bipolar cells [2] and in subsequent neuronal\n                layers of the visual system [6], enhancing the neural representation of spatial contrast\n                and sharpening visual detection of edges.\n\nDespite decades of study, the mechanism of negative feedback from HCs remains\n                controversial. Three main hypotheses have been advanced to explain how this\n                sign-inverting synapse works; that is, how depolarization of the HC inhibits\n                neurotransmitter release from cones. First, it was proposed that HCs release the\n                neurotransmitter GABA, hyperpolarizing the cone membrane potential [7]. Second, an ephaptic\n                mechanism was proposed, in which electrical current through channels in HC dendrites\n                locally changes the transmembrane potential of the cone terminal [8],[9]. The ephaptic\n                signal is proposed to mediate negative feedback and modulate the gain of the cone\n                synapse [10].\n                Third, it was proposed that depolarization of HCs causes the efflux of protons,\n                which acidifies the extracellular space and inhibits cone voltage-gated\n                    Ca2+ channels [11],[12]. The debate continues over which of these mechanisms\n                predominate in generating negative feedback to cones.\n\nHere we report the surprising discovery that HCs also generate\n                    positive feedback onto cones, distinct from the negative\n                feedback signal that has been studied for the past 40 years. Optical imaging methods\n                reveal that the cone neurotransmitter glutamate triggers a retrograde signal from\n                HCs, which elevates intracellular Ca2+ in cones and enhances\n                neurotransmitter release. This signaling system is robust in the intact retina but\n                disrupted in retinal slices, which are often used for investigating the HC synapse.\n                We propose that the positive feedback synapse between HCs and photoreceptors locally\n                offsets the effect of negative feedback and boosts photoreceptor transmission,\n                preserving signal strength in the visual system without sacrificing HC-mediated\n                contrast enhancement.\n\n      Results\n      \n        Glutamate Increases Synaptic Release from Cone Terminals\n        \nTo investigate feedback at the cone-HC synapse we monitored synaptic vesicle\n                    release from cone terminals with fluorescence microscopy. As previously\n                    described, the all-cone retina of the anole lizard was dark-adapted in\n                    physiological saline containing the amphipathic dye FM1-43 [13]. In darkness, cone terminals\n                    support continuous exocytosis and compensatory endocytosis. Vesicles\n                    internalized during endocytosis incorporate the dye, producing brightly labeled\n                    cone synaptic terminals. Washing the retina with a solution containing Advasep-7\n                    removes FM1-43 from the surface membranes of cells but spares the dye in\n                    internalized vesicles. Subsequent loss of dye from synapses results from the\n                    exocytosis of labeled vesicles [13],[14], and this can be monitored with an infrared 2-photon\n                    laser-scanning microscope (Figure\n                        1A).\n\nTo elicit feedback from HCs onto cones we added glutamate to the bath solution.\n                    HCs depolarize when glutamate activates ionotropic glutamate receptors on their\n                    dendrites [15],[16]. Depolarized HCs feed back onto cones by inhibiting\n                    the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that support exocytosis [11],[17],[18]. Hence,\n                    the predicted effect of HC depolarization is a decrease in the\n                    rate of synaptic release from cones. Remarkably, the addition of glutamate\n                        increased release from cone terminals (Figure 1B), with the rate of exocytosis\n                    increasing ∼4-fold over the rate in darkness (Figure 1C).\n\n        Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors Are Responsible for Accelerating Cone\n                    Release\n        \nGlutamate activates ionotropic receptors (iGluRs), metabotropic receptors\n                    (mGluRs), and plasma membrane transporters. To ascertain which of these is\n                    responsible for accelerating release from cones, we started by applying\n                    selective agonists and antagonists of mGluRs. Cones are known to possess group\n                    III mGluRs that can regulate intraterminal Ca2+\n                    [19], but\n                    mGluR agonists decrease synaptic release [20]. In agreement with this,\n                    we found the mGluR group III-selective agonist L-APB slowed FM1-43 release from\n                    dark-adapted cones (Figure\n                        2A). Blocking cone mGluRs with the group II/III antagonist MSPG\n                    failed to increase release, indicating that cone mGluRs are not tonically\n                    activated in darkness, when glutamate release is high.\n\nGlutamate also binds to and activates plasma membrane transporters in cones,\n                    triggering a Cl− current [21]. The current is usually\n                    hyperpolarizing, but under some conditions it might depolarize the cone and\n                    activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, increasing the release\n                    rate. To preclude activation of transporters, we used the iGluR-selective\n                    agonist AMPA, which depolarizes HCs but does not affect the glutamate\n                    transporter [22]\n                    and has no detectable direct action on photoreceptors [15],[19]. Similar to glutamate, AMPA\n                    caused a large (∼6-fold) increase in the release rate from cone terminals\n                        (Figure 2B). The\n                    AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX blocked the effect of AMPA. A\n                    dose-response curve for AMPA reveals an EC50 of 13 µM (Figure 2C), similar to the\n                        EC50 of 15 µM for AMPA receptors in isolated catfish HCs\n                        [15].\n\nTaken together, these results establish that iGluRs are responsible for\n                    triggering the increase in vesicular release from cone terminals. In contrast to\n                    mGluRs and glutamate transporters, which might play a negative feedback role in\n                    regulating cone release, iGluRs play a positive feedback role in augmenting the\n                    release rate. Cone terminals do not appear to possess iGluRs [23],[24],\n                    implying that AMPA-induced acceleration of cone release operates through a\n                    multi-cellular pathway, for example involving HCs.\n\nTo test whether there is sufficient glutamate released in darkness to activate\n                    the positive feedback mechanism, we applied DNQX. DNQX significantly decreased\n                    the FM1-43 release rate by 52%±14%\n                    (p&lt;0.001, Figure 2D, 2E). Hence the ambient concentration of glutamate at the\n                    synapse in darkness is sufficient to activate the positive feedback system.\n\nDepolarizing the cone beyond the dark membrane potential elicits more glutamate\n                    release, which could further increase positive feedback. High K+\n                    (50 mM) saline evoked a 2-fold increase in exocytosis as compared to darkness\n                        (Figure 2F), and\n                    blocking AMPA receptors with DNQX significantly reduced high\n                    K+-elicited release by 56%±12%\n                        (p&lt;0.01). The observation that DNQX reduces cone release\n                    both in darkness and in high K+ suggests that positive feedback\n                    operates over much of the dynamic range of the cone synapse, helping to set the\n                    physiological release rate.\n\nIf elevated glutamate at the synapse can trigger positive feedback, suppressing\n                    glutamate removal from the synapse should enhance cone release. Consistent with\n                    this prediction, we found that TBOA, an inhibitor of the plasma membrane\n                    glutamate transporter [21], increases cone release in darkness by\n                    45%±9% (p&lt;0.005). However, TBOA does\n                    not reduce AMPA- or glutamate-accelerated release, confirming that the glutamate\n                    transporter is not required for positive feedback.\n\nWe found that AMPA increased vesicular release from retinal photoreceptors in\n                    species across several phyla, including zebrafish (Danio\n                    rerio), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), anole\n                    lizard (Anolis carolinensis), and rabbit (Oryctolagus\n                        cuniculus) (Figure S1). In each species AMPA increased\n                    the release rate by &gt;2-fold as compared to darkness. The enhancement of\n                    release was uniform over the variety of cone and rod terminals found in the\n                    outer plexiform layer of these retinas, indicating that AMPA augments release\n                    from both rods and cones. In the rod-only retina of the gecko (Gecko\n                        gecko) AMPA also increases release from rods. In anole retina, AMPA\n                    increased the release rate to about the same final value whether the retina was\n                    dark-adapted or light-adapted (Figure S2), suggesting that AMPA\n                    receptor-regulated release operates through a mechanism that is distinct from\n                    light-regulated release.\n\n        Narrowing Down the Source of the Positive Feedback Signal\n        \nOur results indicate that iGluRs are responsible for augmenting cone release, yet\n                    studies suggest that cone photoreceptors do not possess iGluRs [23],[24]. To\n                    confirm that functional AMPA receptors are absent from cones, we examined\n                    release from cones acutely isolated from the retina. Retinas loaded with FM1-43\n                    were treated with papain and mechanically triturated to isolate individual\n                    cones. The dissociated cones retained bright FM1-43 fluorescence at their\n                    terminals (Figure 3A, top)\n                    and spontaneously released the dye at a rate similar to that measured in the\n                    intact retina. As expected, AMPA had no effect on release from dissociated cones\n                        (Figure 3A, bottom).\n\nWe next tested the effect of AMPA on retinal slices. The transverse retinal slice\n                    is a popular preparation for studying the synapse between HCs and photoreceptors\n                    because it provides unimpeded access for patch-clamp recordings. However,\n                    slicing can damage HCs, whose processes extend laterally over hundreds of\n                    microns, and thus might compromise HC feedback. Indeed, when we prepared 200-\n                    µm-thick slices from FM1-43 loaded retinas, AMPA failed to accelerate\n                    release from cones. When we prepared larger 500 µm-width slices, AMPA\n                    could still accelerate release from cones but only half as much as in the\n                    flat-mounted retina (Figure\n                        3). Because the width of these slices should not affect the health of\n                    the cones whose diameter is ∼10 µm, these results suggest that\n                    AMPA-induced feedback operates through cells that project over a more extended\n                    region (&gt;200 µm).\n\nTo further investigate the source of positive feedback to cones, we used laser\n                    ablation to disrupt various neuronal layers in 500- µm-thick slices of the\n                    anole retina. Prior to AMPA application, the power of the imaging laser was\n                    increased from ∼20 mW to ∼2 W. We scanned along the slice to induce cell\n                    damage in either the portion of the inner nuclear layer (INL) where HC somata\n                    reside or in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which contains processes of\n                    amacrine, bipolar, ganglion, and interplexiform cells (IPCs), but not HCs (Figure 3C, top). Laser\n                    ablation produced immediate cell damage, which was apparent from cellular\n                    blebbing and the loss of dye in the scanned region. There was no significant\n                    difference in the dark release rate from cone terminals caused by ablation of\n                    either the INL or IPL (Figure\n                        3C, bottom). When the laser was targeted to the INL to ablate HCs,\n                    AMPA failed to accelerate FM1-43 release from cone terminals. However, when the\n                    laser was targeted to the IPL, there was no significant difference in the effect\n                    of AMPA on cone release from slices with and without laser ablation (Figure 3B,C,\n                        p = 0.41). These results implicate\n                    cells with processes in the INL, but not in the IPL, as the source of positive\n                    feedback.\n\nHCs and IPCs are the only two laterally projecting neurons in the retina that are\n                    known to contact cones. There are several different types of IPCs containing\n                    different neurotransmitters including dopamine [25] and glycine [26] and receptors\n                    for these transmitters are found on cone terminals [27],[28]. To ascertain whether IPCs\n                    might be the source of positive feedback onto cones, we asked whether AMPA could\n                    still accelerate the cone release rate after applying agonists or antagonists of\n                    dopamine or glycine receptors. AMPA acceleration of cone release was unaffected\n                    by dopamine (100 µM) or glycine (1 mM), and the glycine receptor\n                    antagonist strychnine (1 µM) also failed to block AMPA-accelerated release\n                        (Figure\n                        S3). Hence it seems unlikely that IPCs are the source of\n                    AMPA-elicited positive feedback, focusing our attention on HCs.\n\n        Putative Negative Feedback Mechanisms Are Not Involved in Positive\n                    Feedback\n        \nThree mechanisms have been proposed to account for negative feedback regulation\n                    of cone neurotransmitter release by HCs: (1) GABA-ergic feedback, (2) electrical\n                    (ephaptic) feedback, and (3) proton-mediated feedback. To evaluate whether any\n                    of these mechanisms is involved in AMPA-elicited positive feedback, we\n                    manipulated each of these systems with pharmacological agents while monitoring\n                    FM1-43 release from flat-mounted anole retinas.\n\nFor many years, GABA was the leading candidate as the HC negative feedback signal\n                        [7],[29]. In this\n                    scenario, GABA released from HCs activates GABAA receptors on cone\n                    terminals, hyperpolarizing the cone membrane potential and suppressing\n                    neurotransmitter release. However, GABAA antagonists do not block\n                    negative feedback [30],[31] and rather than regulating a Cl−\n                    conductance in cones as predicted by the GABA hypothesis, HC feedback appears to\n                    regulate a voltage-gated Ca2+ conductance in cones [18],[32]. These\n                    and other studies challenge the role of GABA as the mediator of negative\n                    feedback, but we considered the possibility that GABA could be involved in\n                    positive feedback. We found that neither GABA nor bicuculline, a\n                        GABAA antagonist, had a significant effect on the rate of FM1-43\n                    release from cone terminals (Figure\n                        4A). Moreover, applying GABA or bicuculline for 20 min prior to AMPA\n                    did not significantly change the AMPA-induced increase in FM1-43 release. These\n                    results suggest that GABA is not the positive feedback signal.\n\nThe second hypothesis is that negative feedback from HCs is electrical in nature.\n                    This “ephaptic” hypothesis states that electrical current through\n                    ion channels in the tips of HC dendrites causes a local change in the\n                    extracellular voltage, shifting the activation curve in cones such that a larger\n                    depolarization is needed to activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels\n                        [8],[9]. HCs\n                    possess connexin hemichannels, and HC-mediated negative feedback can be blocked\n                    with the hemichannel blockers Co2+\n                    [30] or\n                    carbenoxolone (CBO) [9]. We used these blockers to test the possible\n                    involvement of hemichannels in AMPA-elicited positive feedback. Both\n                        Co2+ and CBO caused a small but significant decrease in the\n                    dark rate of release (Figure\n                        4B). Both reagents reportedly inhibit cone voltage-gated\n                        Ca2+ channels [33],[34], which could explain the\n                    decreased release rate, although the concentration of Co2+ used\n                    (100 µM) should have a minimal effect on photoreceptor voltage-gated\n                        Ca2+ channels [30]. More to the point,\n                    neither Co2+ nor CBO blocked the AMPA-induced increase in\n                    release. These results rule out hemichannels as mediating AMPA-elicited positive\n                    feedback.\n\nThe third hypothesis is that depolarization of HCs leads to the extrusion of\n                    protons through pumps or channels, acidifying the extracellular space and\n                    inhibiting the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the\n                    cone terminal. Supporting this hypothesis, HC-mediated negative feedback is\n                    blocked by high concentrations of strong pH buffers [11],[12],[35]. To test whether protons\n                    play a role in AMPA-elicited positive feedback, we performed similar\n                    experiments, comparing the effect of AMPA on cone release with bath solutions\n                    that contained either HEPES, a strong buffer that blocks negative feedback, or\n                        HCO3 (bicarbonate), a weak buffer that preserves negative\n                    feedback. We found that a high concentration of HEPES slightly increased the\n                    release rate of cones in darkness as compared to HCO3 (Figure 4C), consistent with\n                    inhibition of negative feedback. However, the AMPA-elicited increase in release\n                    was the same in HCO3 and HEPES, inconsistent with positive feedback\n                    being mediated by a change in pH.\n\n        Glutamate Receptor Activation Triggers an Increase in Ca2+ in\n                    Cone Terminals\n        \nNeurotransmitter release from cones is Ca2+-dependent, so we next\n                    asked whether AMPA leads to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the\n                    cone terminal. Previous studies showed that iGluR agonists fail to elevate cone\n                    terminal Ca2+ in retinal slices [12],[36], but we know that positive\n                    feedback is impaired in the slice preparation. Flat-mounted anole retinas were\n                    incubated with the AM-ester form of Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1), resulting in\n                    incorporation of Ca2+ indicator dye into cone photoreceptors,\n                    retinal ganglion cells, and Muller cells (Figure 5A). Robust OGB-1 labeling was seen in\n                    cone terminals, but not in the adjacent horizontal cells (Figure 5B). Application of AMPA triggered a\n                    large increase of Ca2+ (Figure 5C). In contrast, DNQX caused a small\n                    but significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in Ca2+\n                        (Figure 5C). This result\n                    indicates that the ambient activation of AMPA receptors is sufficient to keep\n                    intracellular Ca2+ elevated, again suggesting that the positive\n                    feedback system is operating in darkness. High K+ saline also\n                    elevated intracellular Ca2+ (Figure 5C), but to a lesser extent than AMPA.\n                    This agrees with the results of Figure 2, which show that FM1-43 release from cone terminals is\n                    accelerated more by AMPA than by high K+.\n\nAMPA triggered a persistent rise in intracellular Ca2+ in cone\n                    terminals that was difficult to reverse, even with prolonged washing. To confirm\n                    that the rise in Ca2+ is reversible, we needed a faster and more\n                    precisely targeted method for activating AMPA receptors. A particularly powerful\n                    approach involves the photolysis of a caged neurotransmitter agonist, for\n                    example 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI)-glutamate [37]. However, glutamate\n                    acts on many receptor types in the retina, and while iGluRs and mGluRs can be\n                    blocked selectively, blockade of glutamate transporters will lead to an increase\n                    in the ambient level of glutamate, confounding our results. In fact, uncaging of\n                    MNI-glutamate triggered oscillations of Ca2+ in cone terminals\n                    that may have been caused by activation of glutamate transporters (unpublished\n                    data).\n\nTo circumvent this problem, we chemically synthesized a form of caged AMPA, which\n                    upon photolysis should activate AMPA receptors but not glutamate transporters.\n                    We synthesized the nitroveratryl carbamate derivative of AMPA (NVOC-AMPA) (Figure 5D), which contains the\n                    photolabile NVOC protecting group that can be removed with exposure to 365 nm\n                    light. Using NVOC-AMPA on the OGB-loaded anole retina, we found that flashes of\n                    UV light could trigger a repeated transient rise in Ca2+ in the\n                    cone terminals (Figure 5E).\n                    Unlike glutamate, AMPA is not removed from the extracellular space by plasma\n                    membrane glutamate transporters, which may account for the slow decay of these\n                    responses. Our ability to resolve the time-course of the cone\n                        Ca2+ increase was hindered by the necessity that we change\n                    optical elements in the microscope when switching from two-photon imaging to\n                    UV-uncaging. However, our experiments show that Ca2+ peaks\n                    within 5 s of the end of the uncaging flash, the shortest interval we could\n                    achieve. The UV uncaging flashes had no measurable effect on cone\n                        Ca2+ when the caged molecule was not present. These\n                    experiments demonstrate that AMPA receptor activation causes a rapid, reversible\n                    rise in Ca2+ in cone terminals.\n\nTo evaluate the spatial spread of the positive feedback signal, we uncaged AMPA\n                    in a small circular region of the OPL (100 µm diameter) and measured the\n                    resulting increase in cone terminal Ca2+ (Figure 5F). We found that the spatial profile\n                    of Ca2+ elevation in the underlying array of cone terminals\n                    closely matched the area of AMPA uncaging (Figure 5G). Hence positive feedback appears\n                    to remain tightly localized to the AMPA-activated region, in contrast to\n                    negative feedback, which can spread widely not only within an individual HC but\n                    between coupled networks of HCs connected through gap junctions [1],[38].\n\n        The Positive Feedback Signal Activates a Voltage-Independent Conductance in\n                    Cones\n        \nWe next turned to electrophysiology to compare positive and negative feedback.\n                    Previous patch clamp studies showed that depolarization of HCs leads to\n                    inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in cones [18], a key\n                    consequence of negative feedback. We confirmed this effect by recording from\n                    synaptically connected HCs and cones in a retinal slice. We used the retina from\n                    tiger salamander because the compact structure of their cones allows for more\n                    effective voltage-clamp of the synaptic terminal than lizard cones, which have a\n                    long axon separating the terminal from the cell body.\n\nWe used a ramp depolarization in cones to activate voltage-gated\n                        Ca2+ channels, which generated an inward current at\n                    potentials more positive than −40 mV (Figure 6A, top). We computed the activation\n                    curve of the Ca2+ channels (Figure 6A, bottom). Hyperpolarizing the HC\n                    increases the cone Ca2+ current and shifts the activation curve\n                    to more negative potentials, whereas depolarizing decreases the current and\n                    shifts the curve to more positive potentials. Substituting extracellular\n                        HCO3 with HEPES prevents the HC-induced shift in activation\n                        (Figure 6B), as shown\n                    previously [11],[17]. Hence, HEPES blocks the electrophysiological\n                    consequence of negative feedback from HCs to cones.\n\nTo selectively examine the consequence of positive feedback, we added HEPES to\n                    the extracellular saline and recorded from cones in flat-mounted retinas instead\n                    of slices. Bath application of AMPA elicited an inward current that increased\n                    with hyperpolarization (Figure\n                        6C) even below the activation range of voltage-gated\n                        Ca2+ channels. In fact, AMPA had no effect on the activation\n                    curve of the Ca2+ channels. Instead, AMPA elicited a current\n                    that changed linearly with voltage.\n\nWhile AMPA elicited an inward current, the AMPA-receptor\n                    antagonist NBQX elicited a small, but significant outward\n                    current, also evident below the activation range of the voltage-gated\n                        Ca2+ channels (Figure 6D). The current versus voltage relationships of the AMPA-\n                    and the NBQX-elicited currents were linear below −40 mV (Figure 6E,F), consistent with\n                    regulation of voltage-insensitive channels. The extrapolated reversal potential\n                    of the AMPA and NBQX responses were −0.6±10 mV and\n                    −4.8±12 mV, respectively, with AMPA causing an increase in membrane\n                    conductance (Figure 6G) and\n                    NBQX causing a small but significant decrease (p&lt;0.05)\n                        (Figure 6H). The nature\n                    of the channels that underlie this conductance is unknown, but the observation\n                    that AMPA leads to rise in Ca2+ in the cone terminal (Figure 5) is suggestive of a\n                    non-selective cation channel that is permeable to Ca2+. However,\n                    we cannot exclude the possibility that the voltage-independent channels are\n                        Ca2+-activated rather than\n                    Ca2+-permeable.\n\nIn summary, positive feedback leads to activation of a voltage-independent\n                    conductance in cones, distinct from negative feedback, which modulates a\n                    voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductance. Supporting this conclusion,\n                    we found that the nicardipine, a blocker of cone voltage-gated\n                        Ca2+ channels [39], had no effect on\n                    AMPA-induced FM1-43 release from anole cones but did block release in darkness\n                    and after exposure to high K+ saline (Figure 6I), both of which depolarize cones.\n                    The two forms of feedback can also be distinguished using HEPES, which blocks\n                    negative feedback but not positive feedback.\n\n        Raising Ca2+ in HCs Triggers Positive Feedback\n        \nOur results thus far suggest that the effect of AMPA on cone release is mediated\n                    by HCs. However, the results of Figure 6 suggest that manipulation of HC voltage cannot completely\n                    recapitulate the effects of iGluR agonists and antagonists on cone release.\n                    Assuming that HCs are the source of positive feedback, something other than\n                    voltage must trigger retrograde signaling to photoreceptors.\n\nCa2+ seems a likely candidate. There is evidence that HCs contain\n                        Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptors [40] and glutamate application\n                    has been shown to elicit a rise in internal Ca2+ in HCs that\n                    does not involve influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or\n                    release from internal stores [41],[42]. Moreover, glutamate receptors on HC dendrites are\n                    located adjacent to the cone terminals [43], ideally positioned to\n                    trigger a Ca2+-dependent feedback signal. To test this\n                    hypothesis, we applied philanthotoxin-74 (PhTx), a blocker of\n                        Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors [44]. As expected, PhTx\n                    significantly decreased FM1-43 release from dark-adapted cones by\n                    49%±17% (p&lt;0.05, Figure\n                    S4A). Moreover, PhTx blocked AMPA-accelerated release from cone terminals\n                    by 68%±17% (p&lt;0.01, Figure\n                    S4B), supporting the involvement of Ca2+-permeable AMPA\n                    receptors in positive feedback.\n\nTo confirm that glutamate can increase Ca2+ in HCs, we carried\n                    out current-clamp recordings from cells in slices of salamander retina and\n                    introduced through a patch pipette the Ca2+ indicator dye\n                        Ca2+-Orange (Figure S5A). Local extracellular two-photon\n                    uncaging of MNI-glutamate [37] led to an increase in Ca2+ in the\n                    portion of the dendritic tree immediately adjacent to the uncaging area (within\n                    2 µm), but not in more distant dendrites (5B,C). This\n                    tight localization of the Ca2+ signal suggests that synaptic\n                    release of glutamate from photoreceptors would also result in a spatially\n                    localized rise in Ca2+ within an HC.\n\nTo determine whether a rise in Ca2+ can trigger retrograde\n                    signaling from HCs, we elevated intracellular Ca2+ in an HC and\n                    asked whether this could increase neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors.\n                    We introduced caged Ca2+ (DM-nitrophen) via a patch pipette into\n                    an HC in a salamander retinal slice and used UV light to trigger photolysis and\n                    elevate internal Ca2+. A brief (1 ms) uncaging light flash\n                    triggered an increase in the frequency of small spontaneous inward currents in\n                    HCs (Figure 7A). The inward\n                    currents were blocked by NBQX, identifying the events as glutamatergic miniature\n                    excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which have been shown previously to\n                    result from photoreceptor vesicular release [45]. Salamander HCs receive\n                    input from rods and cones, so mEPSCSs could be generated by either cell\n                    type.\n\nWe quantified the rate of these events before and after Ca2+\n                    uncaging in 31 HCs. To identify mEPSCs we used a template matching procedure\n                    that compared the waveform of individual events to the average mEPSC (Figure 7B). After\n                        Ca2+ uncaging, the peak mEPSC rate increased in 74%\n                    of cells, decreased in 10% of cells, and did not change in 16% of\n                    cells (Figure 7C). Overall,\n                    the average mEPSC rate increased 86%±29% in the 200 ms\n                    following uncaging, which was statistically significant\n                    (p&lt;0.05). In HCs without DM-nitrophen, the flash caused no\n                    significant change in the mEPSC rate (Figure 7E,F). The increase in mEPSC rate was\n                    rapid, appearing within 100 ms after the uncaging flash (Figure 7C), and persisted for several hundred\n                    milliseconds, consistent with the expected decay of the cytoplasmic\n                        Ca2+ transient [46]. These results suggest that\n                        Ca2+ is sufficient for triggering the retrograde signal that\n                    accelerates vesicular glutamate release from photoreceptors. In addition,\n                    because Ca2+ was uncaged within an individual HC, these results\n                    identify HCs as a source of positive feedback.\n\nDepolarization of HCs decreased the mEPSC rate, opposite to the effect of\n                        Ca2+ uncaging. After depolarizing from −70 to\n                    −40 mV the mEPSC rate declined by 38%±17%\n                        (p&lt;0.05) (Figure 7G). This voltage span approximates the physiological\n                    operating range of the HC in light versus darkness. The decline in mEPSC rate\n                    with HC depolarization is consistent with negative feedback, which decreases\n                    neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors. HEPES inhibits negative feedback\n                        [11],[12],[35] and after adding HEPES, HC depolarization decreased\n                    the mEPSC rate by only 8%±12%, no longer statistically\n                    significant (Figure 7H).\n                    Taken together, these findings indicate that depolarization of the HC leads to a\n                    decrease in neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors, whereas raising\n                        Ca2+ leads to an increase in neurotransmitter release.\n\nWe also attempted to detect positive feedback by recording membrane current in an\n                    individual cone while uncaging Ca2+ in an individual HC.\n                    Positive feedback should elicit a voltage-independent conductance in the cone,\n                    as was elicited by AMPA applied on the entire flat-mounted retina (see Figure 6). However,\n                        Ca2+ uncaging had no significant effect (unpublished data).\n                    Each salamander cone is contacted by ∼12 HCs [47], so the magnitude of the\n                    feedback effect on a single cone from manipulating a single HC should only be\n                    1/12 of the total feedback effect, perhaps too small to detect.\n\n      Discussion\n      \n        HCs Transmit a Positive Feedback Signal to Photoreceptors\n        \nThe findings presented in this article reveal a previously unknown positive\n                    feedback synapse onto cone photoreceptors. Our results indicate that HCs are the\n                    source of this positive feedback signal. HCs possess the type of glutamate\n                    receptors that we implicate in positive feedback (AMPA receptors) and these\n                    receptors are located on HC dendrites that invaginate the cone terminal adjacent\n                    to sites of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Selective laser ablation of cells in\n                    the HC layer of the INL eliminates positive feedback. Retinal slice experiments\n                    suggest that cells that project laterally for &gt;200 µm are required,\n                    consistent with the cytoarchitecture of HCs. Finally, our mEPSC analysis\n                    indicates that neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors can be evoked by\n                    uncaging Ca2+ within an individual HC, identifying HCs as the\n                    source of positive feedback. This shows that a rise in Ca2+ in\n                    an HC is sufficient for triggering positive feedback to\n                    photoreceptors, but we do not yet have the tools to confirm that a rise in\n                        Ca2+ in HCs is necessary for positive\n                    feedback.\n\nSeveral special features of the synaptic connection between HCs and cones may\n                    help explain why positive feedback has evaded notice over the past four decades.\n                    First, positive feedback onto a cone cannot be evoked simply by depolarizing a\n                    synaptically connected HC, the standard test for synaptic connectivity. Second,\n                    positive feedback is compromised by making transverse slices of the retina, a\n                    procedure that is a near-necessity for making electrophysiological recordings\n                    between HCs and other neurons. Third, without a means for selectively\n                    eliminating positive feedback, its effects could easily be misattributed to a\n                    higher intrinsic gain of the synaptic release machinery in cones.\n\nThe discovery of positive feedback helps explain a long-standing puzzle about\n                    synaptic signaling in the outer retina. Kainate and other selective iGluR\n                    agonists hyperpolarize On-bipolar cells in the intact retina [48],[49] but not in\n                    retinal slices [50]–[52]. On-bipolar cells in slices continue to exhibit a\n                    robust response to glutamate, but this can be completely attributed to mGluRs\n                        [53],\n                    which are unaffected by kainate. Our results may help explain the indirect\n                    action of iGluR agonists: They trigger HC-mediated positive feedback onto rods\n                    and cones, increasing their release of glutamate, which leads to\n                    hyperpolarization of the On-bipolar cell. An iGluR-elicited signal in amacrine\n                    cells may be communicated to On-bipolar cells through GABA receptors, also\n                    contributing to the hyperpolarization [51].\n\nOur results suggest that positive feedback applies not only to cones but also to\n                    rods. Most of our optical studies utilized the all-cone retina from anoles, but\n                    in retinas containing both rods and cones (including zebrafish, salamander, and\n                    rabbit) we noticed no difference in the AMPA-elicited acceleration of\n                    neurotransmitter release in rods and cone terminals interspersed in the OPL.\n                    Rods and cones are electrically coupled through gap junctions [54], so it is\n                    possible that AMPA-elicited enhancement of release from rods is an indirect\n                    consequence of signals originating in cones. It is also possible that glutamate\n                    released at photoreceptor synapses “spills over” to affect other\n                    photoreceptor synapses, contributing to enhanced release from both rods and\n                    cones. However, AMPA accelerates release from rod photoreceptors in the gecko\n                    retina, which has no true cones. HC-mediated negative feedback\n                    has recently been demonstrated to occur in rods as well as cones [5], so it\n                    seems likely that the positive feedback signal is also communicated to both\n                    photoreceptors.\n\n        Searching for the Mechanism of Positive Feedback\n        \nFigure 8A shows our proposed\n                    outline of the positive feedback process. First, glutamate released from a cone\n                    activates Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors on an HC, leading to\n                        Ca2+ influx. This results in an increase in cytoplamsic\n                        Ca2+. Next, we propose that intracellular\n                        Ca2+ in the HC triggers the release of a retrograde\n                    messenger that acts on the cone terminal. Finally, this messenger causes an\n                    increase in cone terminal Ca2+ that accelerates neurotransmitter\n                    release.\n\nThe two most important unanswered questions are: (1) What is the identity of the\n                    retrograde messenger? (2) What is the receptor for that messenger that leads to\n                    a rise of intracellular Ca2+ in cones? Our experiments rule out\n                    many conventional neurotransmitters being the retrograde messenger. Positive\n                    feedback persists after adding GABA, glycine, or dopamine to the retina, ruling\n                    out these neurotransmitters. In fact, EM studies show that HC dendrites lack\n                    accumulations of synaptic vesicles and plasma membrane specializations found at\n                    active zones [38], making it unlikely that a conventionally secreted\n                    neurotransmitter is involved.\n\nHowever, neurotransmitters can be released by means other than synaptic vesicle\n                    exocytosis. Activation of plasma membrane transporters on HCs can lead to the\n                    efflux of GABA [55] and protons [56],[57], but our experiments rule\n                    out either of these being the positive feedback signal. Nitric oxide (NO)\n                    diffuses across biological membranes and serves as a retrograde synaptic\n                    messenger in the brain [58]. HCs possess NO synthase (NOS) [59],[60], cones possess the NO effector\n                    enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) [61],[62], cone terminals possess\n                    cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, and Ca2+ influx through\n                    these channels can support release [63]. Moreover, NO donors\n                    increase exocytosis from isolated cones [64] and NOS or sGC inhibitors\n                    decrease release [63]. These observations might seem to make NO a likely\n                    candidate. However, we found that positive feedback persists after application\n                    of an NO donor, inhibitors of NOS, or inhibitors of sGC (Figure\n                    S6A). The ineffectiveness of these reagents argues against NO as the\n                    positive feedback transmitter.\n\nPhospholipid-derived molecules are another class of potential retrograde\n                    messengers. Arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids are released\n                    by the retina in response to light [65],[66], however these compounds\n                    inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in photoreceptors [67], different\n                    from the actions of the positive feedback transmitter. Endocannabinoids,\n                    including anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), are also found in the\n                    retina and there is evidence that they modulate voltage-gated conductances in\n                    cones [68].\n                    We find that anandamide does not activate a voltage-independent conductance in\n                    cones (Figure\n                        S6C), suggesting that it is not the positive feedback transmitter.\n                    There are many other phospholipid-derived molecules that can serve as messengers\n                    between cells. For now, the transmitter that mediates positive feedback from HCs\n                    to cones is unknown, but hopefully, this mystery will be solved more quickly\n                    than the mechanism of negative feedback.\n\nThe retrograde messenger activates a voltage-independent conductance and\n                    increases intracellular Ca2+ in cones, but we do not yet know\n                    the channel(s) that are responsible for these events. Several types of\n                        Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels are found in\n                    photoreceptor terminals, including CNG channels [63],[64] and TRPC channels [69]. The\n                    voltage-independent channel may be the conduit for Ca2+ entry,\n                    but we cannot exclude the possibility that activation of these channels is an\n                    indirect consequence of Ca2+ elevation through some other type\n                    of channel rather than being the cause of Ca2+ elevation. Our\n                    results exclude several other possible routes of Ca2+ entry.\n                    Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels can be excluded because AMPA\n                    accelerates release in nicardipine (Figure 6I). Ca2+ release from internal stores seems\n                    unlikely because reagents that interfere with this process do not inhibit\n                    AMPA-accelerated release (Figure S6B).\n\n        Functional Consequences of Positive and Negative Feedback\n        \nThe cone synapse encodes information about light intensity by modulating its rate\n                    of vesicular neurotransmitter release. Because vesicular release is quantal, the\n                    encoding capacity of the cone synapse is limited by the maximal release rate\n                    (i.e., in darkness) [14]. Any process that decreases the maximal release rate\n                    will degrade the representation of light intensity by the cone synapse, which in\n                    turn will degrade the performance of the visual system as a whole.\n\nNegative feedback from HCs enhances the neural representation of spatial contrast\n                    as an array of photoreceptors transmits a visual image to bipolar cells.\n                    However, the benefit of contrast enhancement comes at a cost: negative feedback\n                    lowers the maximal release rate and therefore reduces the dynamic range of the\n                    cone synapse. This compresses the neural representation of a visual image,\n                    counteracting enhanced contrast sensitivity. By boosting neurotransmitter\n                    release from cones, positive feedback may recoup the dynamic range lost to\n                    negative feedback. The factors that prevent positive feedback from causing\n                    runaway excitation remain to be determined.\n\nOur results indicate that positive feedback temporally overlaps with negative\n                    feedback and might play a role in the neural representation of visual stimuli.\n                    While the precise time course of positive feedback remains to be determined, the\n                    rise in intracellular Ca2+ in an HC peaks within 1 s of\n                    glutamate application (Figure S5C), and the acceleration of\n                    photoreceptor transmitter release peaks within 100 ms of HC Ca2+\n                    elevation (Figure 7D). These\n                    values are over-estimates that are limited by the temporal resolution of our\n                    recording methods. In comparison, negative feedback peaks within 100 ms of the\n                    onset of light [3] and is maintained indefinitely with persistent\n                    illumination.\n\nWe propose that the signals that give rise to positive and negative feedback\n                    spread differently through an HC, which may explain why the signals do not\n                    simply cancel out (Figure\n                    8B). Our results suggest that positive feedback acts locally, occurring\n                    only where HC dendrites receive direct excitatory input (Figure 5F,G). Immunocytochemistry shows that\n                    HCs express the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and CaBP-28K [70], and\n                    these proteins may limit the spread of Ca2+ to individual HC\n                    dendrites, making Ca2+-dependent positive feedback local. In\n                    contrast, negative feedback is controlled by the HC voltage, not by\n                        Ca2+. The voltage signal generated by synaptic current into\n                    individual dendrites spreads electrotonically, not only within a single HC but\n                    through the syncytium of HCs, distributing negative feedback over a large area\n                        [71],[72]. Thus our\n                    working hypothesis is that positive feedback is more spatially constrained than\n                    negative feedback.\n\nIt is perhaps counterintuitive, but if the two feedback signals were to spread\n                    differently, positive feedback would amplify, rather than suppress, contrast\n                    enhancement mediated by negative feedback. We explored the interplay between\n                    these two processes by constructing a model (see Methods) of how feedback might impact release from a linear array of\n                    cone terminals (Figure 8B).\n                    When a dark spot on a brighter background is projected on the retina, cones\n                    within the center of the spot are depolarized, maintaining their rate of\n                    glutamate release, while those in the surround are hyperpolarized, decreasing\n                    release. In the absence of negative feedback, the spatial profile of release\n                    from an array of cones mirrors the profile of the stimulus. Adding negative\n                    feedback enhances the representation of contrast by opposing the intrinsic\n                    response of cones. Release from terminals in the dark spot is decreased by\n                    depolarized HCs, while release from terminals in the brighter surround is\n                    increased by hyperpolarized HCs. Cone terminals at the light-dark edge receive\n                    inputs from HCs straddling the border. Because negative feedback spreads through\n                    HCs, cones near the edge will receive signals from both depolarized and\n                    hyperpolarized HCs and their effects will cancel, unleashing the full ability of\n                    light and dark to modulate cone release. If positive feedback were spatially\n                    constrained, it would scale release in direct proportion to the local synaptic\n                    output from individual cones. As a result, positive feedback could amplify cone\n                    release without sacrificing the contrast enhancement provided by negative\n                    feedback.\n\n      Materials and Methods\n      \n        Dye Loading\n        \nAll procedures were approved by the UC Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee.\n                    Retina were isolated as described previously [14] from lizards (Anolis\n                        segrei), tiger salamanders (Abystoma tigrinum),\n                    tokay geckos (Gecko gecko), zebrafish (Danio\n                        rerio), and New Zealand white rabbits maintained on a 12∶12\n                    light:dark cycle.

For rabbit retinas, the\n                    saline solution contained: 1.9 g/L NaHCO3, 0.05 g/L kanamyacin\n                    sulfate, 8.8 g/L Ames powder (Sigma), bubbled with 95%\n                    O2–5% CO2.\n\nFor FM1-43 loading, retinas were mounted onto nitrocellulose filter paper\n                    RPE-side down, and bathed in saline containing 30 µM FM1-43 for 1–3\n                    h followed by a 5 min wash with 1 mM Advasep-7, as described previously [13]. Retinal\n                    slices were prepared using a Stoelting tissue chopper. Retinas were mounted for\n                    imaging in a gravity fed perfusion chamber with a bath volume of ∼0.5 ml\n                    (Warner Instruments) and perfused with solution at 1 ml/min. Drugs were bath\n                    applied by perfusion. High K+ saline contained 50 mM KCl,\n                    iso-osmotically replacing NaCl.\n\nFor Ca2+ indicator dye loading, retinas were bathed for 2 h in\n                    saline containing 100 µM of either Oregon Green BAPTA-1 AM (OGB-1 AM) or,\n                    in some experiments, X-Rhod-1 AM (Molecular Probes). The loading solution\n                    contained 1% DMSO and 0.2% pluronic acid to enhance dye solubility\n                    and cell permeation, and retinas were gently agitated to encourage\n                    dye-permeation into the tissue. Dye-loaded retinas were mounted onto\n                    nitrocellulose filter paper RPE-side down after loading.\n\n        Imaging\n        \nRetinas were imaged with a Zeiss 510 upright confocal microscope equipped with a\n                    MaiTai (Spectra Physics) mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser and a 20× or\n                    40× water-immersion objective. The excitation wavelength was tuned to 860\n                    nm (FM1-43), 800 nm (OGB-1), or 880 nm (X-Rhod-1). Laser intensity was\n                    20–40 mW, averaged power. Images were acquired with Zeiss LSM software,\n                    and ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) was used to analyze the average\n                    fluorescence of the OPL.\n\nFM1-43 fluorescence in the OPL of retinal flat-mounts was measured by taking\n                    5–6 images in a Z-stack spaced at 2 µm so that the OPL fell entirely\n                    within the Z-stack. Anole cone terminals are ∼6 µm in diameter, so in\n                    each stack the brightest focal plane could be identified as containing the\n                    center of the cone terminals, and average intensity was measured from this focal\n                    plane. This allowed us to readjust our measurement at each time point to\n                    compensate for movement of the sample. When the retina was not perfectly flat,\n                    the image was divided into quadrants and the measurements were made from the\n                    brightest image for each quadrant. The pixel dimension was 0.82×0.82\n                    µm (256×256 pixels) and the dwell time per pixel was 3.2 µs\n                    (493 ms per image).\n\nFluorescence was normalized to 1.0 at the start of experiments. Dye release rates\n                    were calculated from the fluorescence decrements between images in time series.\n                    Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's\n                        t tests in Excel (Microsoft). In previous studies we\n                    background subtracted OPL measurements with respect to the fluorescence of the\n                    INL, which exhibits no light-dependent change in fluorescence over the recording\n                    period of ∼20 min [14]. However, in this study we could not be certain that\n                    glutamate receptor agonists have no effect on FM1-43 fluorescence in the INL, so\n                    no background subtraction was used. Consequently, the rate of the normalized\n                    FM1-43 fluorescence decline is slower here than in previous reports [14],[73]. Graphing\n                    and curve fitting was performed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Unless noted\n                    otherwise, variability among data throughout the article is represented as mean\n                    ± SEM.\n\n        Ablation and Agonist-Uncaging\n        \nTo ablate cell layers in retinal slices, the Ti:sapphire laser power was\n                    increased to maximal (∼2 W average output) and the laser was scanned in a\n                    line 400–500 µm across the slice surface at the layer of the retina\n                    chosen for ablation, at a speed of 500 µm/ms. The line scan was repeated 8\n                    times, before the focus was moved in the z-direction. This was repeated at depth\n                    intervals of 2 µm, to a final depth of 30 µm into the slice.\n\nFor experiments involving NVOC-AMPA uncaging, light from a mercury lamp was\n                    focused through the microscope objective onto the plane of the OPL. Light was\n                    filtered through a Zeiss FS02 filter set\n                    (EMmax = 365 nm) and controlled by electronic\n                    shutter. To uncage AMPA within a small spot, the microscope field stop was\n                    closed, producing a spot of UV light with a Gaussian profile and a FWHM diameter\n                    of 100 µm, determined by photobleaching of FM1-43 absorbed onto filter\n                    paper.\n\nFor MNI-glutamate uncaging, the mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser was tuned to 720 nm\n                    light (∼50 mW). After adding 2 mM MNI-glu to the bath solution, the laser\n                    was scanned over a 2×2 µm section of the HC dendrite for &lt;100\n                    µs. Calcium Orange dye was excited with a 543 nm HeNe laser, and images\n                    were acquired at 1 s intervals using a Zeiss 510 upright confocal\n                    microscope.\n\n        Electrophysiology\n        \nRetinal slices from the larval tiger salamander Ambystoma\n                        tigrinum were prepared as previously described [22] using\n                    procedures approved by the UNMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The\n                    standard bath solution contained (in mM): 101 NaCl, 22 NaHCO3, 2.5\n                    KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 9 glucose. The pH was ∼7.35\n                    after bubbling with 95% O2/5% CO2. Where\n                    indicated, pH buffering capacity was increased by adding 10 mM HEPES. Whole-cell\n                    voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from cones or horizontal cells using\n                    10–15 MΩ patch pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass. The standard\n                    pipette solution contained (in mM): 48 CsGluconate, 42 CsCl, 9.4 TEACl, 1.9\n                        MgCl2, 9.4 MgATP, 0.5 GTP, 5 EGTA, 32.9 HEPES (pH 7.2). For\n                    MNI-glutamate uncaging on horizontal cells, the pipette solution contained 0.5\n                    EGTA and 100 µM Calcium Orange. For caged Ca2+ experiments\n                    with horizontal cells, the pipette solution consisted of (in mM): 40\n                    CsGluconate, 20 CsGlutamate, 40 CsHEPES, 10 TEACl, 10 DM-nitrophen, 8 CaCl2, 1\n                        MgCl2, 2 DPTA, 5 NaATP, 0.5 mM GTP (pH 7.2). Resting\n                        [Ca2+] prior to photolysis was &lt;200 nM as\n                    determined from aliquots using Fura-2. DM-nitrophen was photolyzed by flashes of\n                    UV light derived from a Xenon arc flash lamp (Rapp Optoelectronic). Cones were\n                    voltage clamped at −70 mV and horizontal cells at −60 mV using a\n                    Multiclamp or Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier. Data were acquired with a\n                    Digidata 1322 interface and pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). mEPSCs were\n                    analyzed using the template search Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices).\n                    Statistical comparisons were performed using paired two-tailed Student's\n                        t tests in Excel.\n\n        Modeling Feedback\n        \nAn array of photoreceptors was stimulated with a dark spot on a brighter\n                    background. Photoreceptors were assigned arbitrary intrinsic release rates of 1\n                    in darkness and 0.2 in light. To model negative feedback, release from many\n                    photoreceptors was integrated by each post-synaptic HC to produce an unscaled HC\n                    voltage that in turn regulated feedback, according to the\n                            function:where N is the number of presynaptic cones, Ri\n                    the release rate of the ith cone, Δxi the distance between the\n                    ith cone and the HC center, and λ the length constant of voltage spread in\n                    HCs. Release after feedback was calculated as Rneg\n                     =  Ri − Cneg•\n                        (VHC−Rmin), and Rpos\n                     =  Cpos•Rneg, where\n                        Cneg and Cpos are arbitrary scaling constants\n                    determining the strength of feedback, which were both set to 1.5.\n\n      Supporting Information"
