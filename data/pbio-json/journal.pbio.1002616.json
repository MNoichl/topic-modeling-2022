  "fullText": "The authors would like to clarify several issues recently raised by the PLOS Biology editors.\n\nIn Fig 1 and Fig 2 the same image of beta-actin loading control has been mistakenly used for panels Fig 1B, Fig 1E and Fig 2D. Please see the corrected figures here, in which the beta-actin control for Fig 1E and Fig 2D is replaced with the correct image. The figure legends remain unchanged.\n\nIn Fig 2D, two time points (days 1 and 14) are not included. As requested by the editors, the authors have re-run this experiment, using the same cell lines as used in the original experiments and, with this newly generated data, provided a corrected version of the figure here that includes both days 1 and 14. In addition, all three gel images from replicate experiments for Fig 2D are presented in a new S1 File. Quantitation of these three replicate gels is presented as a bar graph in revised Fig 2D. The editors have verified the data underlying the corrected panel and are satisfied that these continue to uphold the conclusions from this figure.\n\nSupporting information"
