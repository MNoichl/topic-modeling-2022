Type I chaperonins are large, double-ring complexes present in bacteria (GroEL),
                    mitochondria (Hsp60), and chloroplasts (Cpn60), which are involved in mediating
                    the folding of newly synthesized, translocated, or stress-denatured proteins. In
                        Escherichia coli, GroEL comprises 14 identical subunits and
                    has been exquisitely optimized to fold its broad range of substrates. However,
                    multiple Cpn60 subunits with different expression profiles have evolved in
                    chloroplasts. Here, we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the
                    minor subunit Cpn60β4 forms a heterooligomeric Cpn60 complex with
                    Cpn60α1 and Cpn60β1–β3 and is specifically required for the
                    folding of NdhH, a subunit of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex
                    (NDH). Other Cpn60β subunits cannot complement the function of Cpn60β4.
                    Furthermore, the unique C-terminus of Cpn60β4 is required for the full
                    activity of the unique Cpn60 complex containing Cpn60β4 for folding of NdhH.
                    Our findings suggest that this unusual kind of subunit enables the Cpn60 complex
                    to assist the folding of some particular substrates, whereas other dominant
                    Cpn60 subunits maintain a housekeeping chaperonin function by facilitating the
                    folding of other obligate substrates.
