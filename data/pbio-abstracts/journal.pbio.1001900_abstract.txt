Kim and Ziff examine the molecular mechanism of synaptic scaling, showing that inhibition of neuronal excitability reduces calcium influx into neurons, resulting in decreased calcineurin activity. This leads to increased surface expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors as a homeostatic response.
