Failure to archive published data can impede reproducibility and inhibit downstream synthesis. Alarmingly, we estimate that âˆ¼70% of existing DNA sequence alignments/phylogenetic trees, representing much of the underpinning of modern phylogenetic analysis, are no longer accessible. The evolutionary biology community needs to adopt policies ensuring that data are publicly archived upon publication.
