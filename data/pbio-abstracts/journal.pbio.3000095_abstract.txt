Regulation of cellular ATP level is critical for diverse biological processes and may be defective in diseases such as cancer and mitochondrial disorders. While mitochondria play critical roles in ATP level regulation, we still lack a systematic and quantitative picture of how individual mitochondrial-related genes contribute to cellular ATP level and how dysregulated ATP levels may affect downstream cellular processes. Advances in genetically encoded ATP biosensors have provided new opportunities for addressing these issues. ATP biosensors allow researchers to quantify the changes of ATP levels in real time at the single-cell level and characterize corresponding effects at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. Along this direction, several recent single-cell studies using ATP biosensors, including the work by Mendelsohn and colleagues, have started to uncover the principles for how genetic and nongenetic parameters may modulate ATP levels to affect cellular functions and human health.
