Correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy (CLEIM) offers huge potential to track the intracellular fate of antibiotics, with organelle-level resolution. However, a correlative approach that enables subcellular antibiotic visualisation in pathogen-infected tissue is lacking. Here, we developed correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy in tissue (CLEIMiT) and used it to identify the cell typeâ€“specific accumulation of an antibiotic in lung lesions of mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Using CLEIMiT, we found that the anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug bedaquiline (BDQ) is localised not only in foamy macrophages in the lungs during infection but also accumulate in polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells.
