Adenosine modulation is considered both a paracrine signal coordinating different cells in a tissue and a stress signal. Both functions are ensured by 4 types of adenosine receptors (ARs), which have been studied individually. Mice with knockout of all ARs (quad-AR-KO) now allow enquiring the overall function of the adenosine modulation system. The observed “normal” physiology of quad-AR-KO mice indicates that ARs do not regulate homeostasis and are likely recruited to selectively control allostasis.
