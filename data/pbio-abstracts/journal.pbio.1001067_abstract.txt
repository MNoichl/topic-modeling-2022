Assessment of conservation status is done both for areas or habitats and for
                    species (or taxa). IUCN Red List categories have been the principal method of
                    categorising species in terms of extinction risk, and have been shown to be
                    robust and helpful in the groups for which they have been developed. A recent
                    study highlights properties associated with extinction risk in flowering plants,
                    focusing on the species-rich hot spot of the Cape region of South Africa, and
                    concludes that merely following methods derived from studies of vertebrates may
                    not provide the best estimates of extinction risk for plants. Biology,
                    geography, and history all are important factors in risk, and the study poses
                    many questions about how we categorise and assess species for conservation
                    priorities.
