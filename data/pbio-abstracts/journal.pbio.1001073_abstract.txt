Amino-terminal acetylation is probably the most common protein modification in
                    eukaryotes with as many as 50%â€“80% of proteins reportedly
                    altered in this way. Here we report a systematic analysis of the predicted
                    N-terminal processing of cytosolic proteins versus those destined to be sorted
                    to the secretory pathway. While cytosolic proteins were profoundly biased in
                    favour of processing, we found an equal and opposite bias against such
                    modification for secretory proteins. Mutations in secretory signal sequences
                    that led to their acetylation resulted in mis-sorting to the cytosol in a manner
                    that was dependent upon the N-terminal processing machinery. Hence N-terminal
                    acetylation represents an early determining step in the cellular sorting of
                    nascent polypeptides that appears to be conserved across a wide range of
                    species.
