The eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) domain mediates the majority of signaling and
          coordination of complex events in eukaryotes. By contrast, most bacterial signaling is
          thought to occur through structurally unrelated histidine kinases, though some ePK-like
          kinases (ELKs) and small molecule kinases are known in bacteria. Our analysis of the
          Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) dataset reveals that ELKs are as prevalent as histidine
          kinases and may play an equally important role in prokaryotic behavior. By combining GOS
          and public databases, we show that the ePK is just one subset of a diverse superfamily of
          enzymes built on a common protein kinaseâ€“like (PKL) fold. We explored this huge
          phylogenetic and functional space to cast light on the ancient evolution of this
          superfamily, its mechanistic core, and the structural basis for its observed diversity. We
          cataloged 27,677 ePKs and 18,699 ELKs, and classified them into 20 highly distinct
          families whose known members suggest regulatory functions. GOS data more than tripled the
          count of ELK sequences and enabled the discovery of novel families and classification and
          analysis of all ELKs. Comparison between and within families revealed ten key residues
          that are highly conserved across families. However, all but one of the ten residues has
          been eliminated in one family or another, indicating great functional plasticity. We show
          that loss of a catalytic lysine in two families is compensated by distinct mechanisms both
          involving other key motifs. This diverse superfamily serves as a model for further
          structural and functional analysis of enzyme evolution.
