Premature release of nascent ribosomes into the translating pool must be prevented because these do not support viability and may be prone to mistakes. Here, we show that the kinase Rio1, the nuclease Nob1, and its binding partner Pno1 cooperate to establish a checkpoint that prevents the escape of immature ribosomes into polysomes. Nob1 blocks mRNA recruitment, and rRNA cleavage is required for its dissociation from nascent 40S subunits, thereby setting up a checkpoint for maturation. Rio1 releases Nob1 and Pno1 from pre-40S ribosomes to discharge nascent 40S into the translating pool. Weak-binding Nob1 and Pno1 mutants can bypass the requirement for Rio1, and Pno1 mutants rescue cell viability. In these strains, immature ribosomes escape into the translating pool, where they cause fidelity defects and perturb protein homeostasis. Thus, the Rio1–Nob1–Pno1 network establishes a checkpoint that safeguards against the release of immature ribosomes into the translating pool.
