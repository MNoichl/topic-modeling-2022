Glucagon, secreted from pancreatic islet α cells, stimulates gluconeogenesis and liver glycogen breakdown. The mechanism regulating glucagon release is debated, and variously attributed to neuronal control, paracrine control by neighbouring β cells, or to an intrinsic glucose sensing by the α cells themselves. We examined hormone secretion and Ca2+ responses of α and β cells within intact rodent and human islets. Glucose-dependent suppression of glucagon release persisted when paracrine GABA or Zn2+ signalling was blocked, but was reversed by low concentrations (1–20 μM) of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel opener diazoxide, which had no effect on insulin release or β cell responses. This effect was prevented by the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide (100 μM). Higher diazoxide concentrations (≥30 μM) decreased glucagon and insulin secretion, and α- and β-cell Ca2+ responses, in parallel. In the absence of glucose, tolbutamide at low concentrations (&lt;1 μM) stimulated glucagon secretion, whereas high concentrations (&gt;10 μM) were inhibitory. In the presence of a maximally inhibitory concentration of tolbutamide (0.5 mM), glucose had no additional suppressive effect. Downstream of the KATP channel, inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ (TTX) and N-type Ca2+ channels (ω-conotoxin), but not L-type Ca2+ channels (nifedipine), prevented glucagon secretion. Both the N-type Ca2+ channels and α-cell exocytosis were inactivated at depolarised membrane potentials. Rodent and human glucagon secretion is regulated by an α-cell KATP channel-dependent mechanism. We propose that elevated glucose reduces electrical activity and exocytosis via depolarisation-induced inactivation of ion channels involved in action potential firing and secretion.
