Lipids are essential components of biological membranes that present a wide diversity in eukaryotic cells. Recent impressive advances in lipid biochemistry and biophysics have enabled a refocus of our view of lipids as functional units for cellular activity. However, the gap between molecular and cellular processes remains to be bridged. Here, 2 papers meet the burden of proof that choline transporters participate in local lipid composition modifications at the trans-Golgi network, an intracellular compartment that serves as the main sorting station in the cell. Localization of choline transporters to this precise compartment could be a way for plant cells to quickly modify the membrane lipid composition and asymmetry during both the allocation of cargos and the recruitment of trafficking machineries into distinct subcellular pathways.
