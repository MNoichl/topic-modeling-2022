Many animals can encode temporal intervals and use them to plan their actions, but only humans can flexibly extract a regular beat from complex patterns, such as musical rhythms. Beat-based timing is hypothesized to rely on the integration of sensory information with temporal information encoded in motor regions such as the medial premotor cortex (MPC), but how beat-based timing might be encoded in neuronal populations is mostly unknown. GÃ¡mez and colleagues show that the MPC encodes temporal information via a population code visible as circular trajectories in state space; these patterns may represent precursors to more-complex skills such as beat-based timing.
