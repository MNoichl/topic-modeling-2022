Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a photosensitive, DNA repair disorder associated with progeria
          that is caused by a defect in the transcription-coupled repair subpathway of nucleotide
          excision repair (NER). Here, complete inactivation of NER in
              Csbm/m/Xpa−/−
          mutants causes a phenotype that reliably mimics the human progeroid CS syndrome. Newborn
              Csbm/m/Xpa−/− mice display
          attenuated growth, progressive neurological dysfunction, retinal degeneration, cachexia,
          kyphosis, and die before weaning. Mouse liver transcriptome analysis and several
          physiological endpoints revealed systemic suppression of the growth hormone/insulin-like
          growth factor 1 (GH/IGF1) somatotroph axis and oxidative metabolism, increased antioxidant
          responses, and hypoglycemia together with hepatic glycogen and fat accumulation. Broad
          genome-wide parallels between
            Csbm/m/Xpa−/− and naturally
          aged mouse liver transcriptomes suggested that these changes are intrinsic to natural
          ageing and the DNA repair–deficient mice. Importantly, wild-type mice exposed to
          a low dose of chronic genotoxic stress recapitulated this response, thereby pointing to a
          novel link between genome instability and the age-related decline of the somatotroph
        axis.
