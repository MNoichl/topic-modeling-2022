Cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) have a reciprocal synapse that
                    underlies lateral inhibition and establishes the antagonistic center-surround
                    organization of the visual system. Cones transmit to HCs through an excitatory
                    synapse and HCs feed back to cones through an inhibitory synapse. Here we report
                    that HCs also transmit to cone terminals a positive feedback signal that
                    elevates intracellular Ca2+ and accelerates neurotransmitter
                    release. Positive and negative feedback are both initiated by AMPA receptors on
                    HCs, but positive feedback appears to be mediated by a change in HC
                        Ca2+, whereas negative feedback is mediated by a change in
                    HC membrane potential. Local uncaging of AMPA receptor agonists suggests that
                    positive feedback is spatially constrained to active HC-cone synapses, whereas
                    the negative feedback signal spreads through HCs to affect release from
                    surrounding cones. By locally offsetting the effects of negative feedback,
                    positive feedback may amplify photoreceptor synaptic release without sacrificing
                    HC-mediated contrast enhancement.
