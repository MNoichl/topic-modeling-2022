Mycobacteriophage Bxb1 integrates its DNA at the 
					attB site of the 
					Mycobacterium smegmatis genome using the viral 
					attP site and a phage-encoded integrase generating the recombinant junctions 
					attL and 
					attR. The Bxb1 integrase is a member of the serine recombinase family of site-specific recombination proteins and utilizes small (&lt;50 base pair) substrates for recombination, promoting strand exchange without the necessity for complex higher order macromolecular architectures. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism for the integration and excision reactions, we have identified a Bxb1-encoded recombination directionality factor (RDF), the product of gene 
					47. Bxb1 gp47 is an unusual RDF in that it is relatively large (̃28 kDa), unrelated to all other RDFs, and presumably performs dual functions since it is well conserved in mycobacteriophages that utilize unrelated integration systems. Furthermore, unlike other RDFs, Bxb1 gp47 does not bind DNA and functions solely through direct interaction with integrase–DNA complexes. The nature and consequences of this interaction depend on the specific DNA substrate to which integrase is bound, generating electrophoretically stable tertiary complexes with either 
					attB or 
					attP that are unable to undergo integrative recombination, and weakly bound, electrophoretically unstable complexes with either 
					attL or 
					attR that gain full potential for excisive recombination.
