The pre- and postsynaptic membranes comprising the synaptic junction differ in protein composition. The membrane trafficking mechanisms by which neurons control surface polarization of synaptic receptors remain poorly understood. The sorting receptor Sortilin-related CNS expressed 1 (SorCS1) is a critical regulator of trafficking of neuronal receptors, including the presynaptic adhesion molecule neurexin (Nrxn), an essential synaptic organizer. Here, we show that SorCS1 maintains a balance between axonal and dendritic Nrxn surface levels in the same neuron. Newly synthesized Nrxn1α traffics to the dendritic surface, where it is endocytosed. Endosomal SorCS1 interacts with the Rab11 GTPase effector Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 (Rab11FIP5)/Rab11 interacting protein (Rip11) to facilitate the transition of internalized Nrxn1α from early to recycling endosomes and bias Nrxn1α surface polarization towards the axon. In the absence of SorCS1, Nrxn1α accumulates in early endosomes and mispolarizes to the dendritic surface, impairing presynaptic differentiation and function. Thus, SorCS1-mediated sorting in dendritic endosomes controls Nrxn axonal surface polarization required for proper synapse development and function.
