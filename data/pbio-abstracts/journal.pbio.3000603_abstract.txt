Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance along with pancreatic β cell failure. β cell factors are traditionally thought to control glucose homeostasis by modulating insulin levels, not insulin sensitivity. Exosomes are emerging as new regulators of intercellular communication. However, the role of β-cell–derived exosomes in metabolic homeostasis is poorly understood. Here, we report that microRNA-26a (miR-26a) in β cells not only modulates insulin secretion and β cell replication in an autocrine manner but also regulates peripheral insulin sensitivity in a paracrine manner through circulating exosomes. MiR-26a is reduced in serum exosomes of overweight humans and is inversely correlated with clinical features of T2D. Moreover, miR-26a is down-regulated in serum exosomes and islets of obese mice. Using miR-26a knockin and knockout mouse models, we showed that miR-26a in β cells alleviates obesity-induced insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Mechanistically, miR-26a in β cells enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity via exosomes. Meanwhile, miR-26a prevents hyperinsulinemia through targeting several critical regulators of insulin secretion and β cell proliferation. These findings provide a new paradigm for the far-reaching systemic functions of β cells and offer opportunities for the treatment of T2D.
