Mutations that decrease insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and growth hormone signaling
          limit body size and prolong lifespan in mice. In vertebrates, these somatotropic hormones
          are controlled by the neuroendocrine brain. Hormone-like regulations discovered in
          nematodes and flies suggest that IGF signals in the nervous system can determine lifespan,
          but it is unknown whether this applies to higher organisms. Using conditional mutagenesis
          in the mouse, we show that brain IGF receptors (IGF-1R) efficiently regulate somatotropic
          development. Partial inactivation of IGF-1R in the embryonic brain selectively inhibited
          GH and IGF-I pathways after birth. This caused growth retardation, smaller adult size, and
          metabolic alterations, and led to delayed mortality and longer mean lifespan. Thus, early
          changes in neuroendocrine development can durably modify the life trajectory in mammals.
          The underlying mechanism appears to be an adaptive plasticity of somatotropic functions
          allowing individuals to decelerate growth and preserve resources, and thereby improve
          fitness in challenging environments. Our results also suggest that tonic somatotropic
          signaling entails the risk of shortened lifespan.
