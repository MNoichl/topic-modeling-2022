Cilia are remarkable cellular devices that power cell motility and transduce extracellular signals. To assemble a cilium, a cylindrical array of 9 doublet microtubules push out an extension of the plasma membrane. Membrane tension regulates cilium formation; however, molecular pathways that link mechanical stimuli to ciliogenesis are unclear. Using genome editing, we introduced hereditary elliptocytosis (HE)- and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-associated mutations into the Caenorhabditis elegans membrane skeletal protein spectrin. We show that these mutations impair mechanical support for the plasma membrane and change cell shape. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of spectrin-mutant animals uncovered a global down-regulation of ciliary gene expression, prompting us to investigate whether spectrin participates in ciliogenesis. Spectrin mutations affect intraflagellar transport (IFT), disrupt axonemal microtubules, and inhibit cilium formation, and the endogenous spectrin periodically distributes along cilia. Mammalian spectrin also localizes in cilia and regulates ciliogenesis. These results define a previously unrecognized yet conserved role of spectrin-based mechanical support for cilium biogenesis.
