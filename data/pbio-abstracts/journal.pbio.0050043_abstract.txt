It has long been thought that signal joints, the byproducts of V(D)J recombination, are
          not involved in the dynamics of the rearrangement process. Evidence has now started to
          accumulate that this is not the case, and that signal joints play unsuspected roles in
          events that might compromise genomic integrity. Here we show both ex vivo and in vivo that
          the episomal circles excised during the normal process of receptor gene rearrangement may
          be reintegrated into the genome through trans-V(D)J recombination
          occurring between the episomal signal joint and an immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor target.
          We further demonstrate that cryptic recombination sites involved in T-cell acute
          lymphoblastic leukemiaâ€“associated chromosomal translocations constitute hotspots
          of insertion. Eventually, the identification of two in vivo cases associating episomal
          reintegration and chromosomal translocation suggests that reintegration events are linked
          to genomic instability. Altogether, our data suggest that V(D)J-mediated reintegration of
          episomal circles, an event likely eluding classical cytogenetic screenings, might
          represent an additional potent source of genomic instability and lymphoid cancer.
