Many mRNAs specifically localize within the cytoplasm and are present in RNA-protein complexes. It is generally assumed that localization and complex formation of these RNAs are controlled by trans-acting proteins encoded by genes different than the RNAs themselves. Here, we analyze slow as molasses (slam) mRNA that prominently colocalizes with its encoded protein at the basal cortical compartment during cellularization. The functional implications of this striking colocalization have been unknown. Here, we show that slam mRNA translation is spatiotemporally controlled. We found that translation was largely restricted to the onset of cellularization when Slam protein levels at the basal domain sharply increase. slam mRNA was translated locally, at least partially, as not yet translated mRNA transiently accumulated at the basal region. Slam RNA accumulated at the basal domain only if Slam protein was present. Furthermore, a slam RNA with impaired localization but full coding capacity was only weakly translated. We detected a biochemical interaction of slam mRNA and protein as demonstrated by specific co-immunoprecipitation from embryonic lysate. The intimate relationship of slam mRNA and protein may constitute a positive feedback loop that facilitates and controls timely and rapid accumulation of Slam protein at the prospective basal region.
