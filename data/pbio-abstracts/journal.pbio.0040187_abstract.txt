The genes encoding members of the wingless-related MMTV integration site (WNT) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families coordinate growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation in many fields of cells during development. In the mouse, 
					Fgf9 and 
					Wnt4 are expressed in gonads of both sexes prior to sex determination. Loss of 
					Fgf9 leads to XY sex reversal, whereas loss of 
					Wnt4 results in partial testis development in XX gonads. However, the relationship between these signals and the male sex-determining gene, 
					Sry, was unknown. We show through gain- and loss-of-function experiments that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and WNT4 act as opposing signals to regulate sex determination. In the mouse XY gonad, 
					Sry normally initiates a feed-forward loop between 
					Sox9 and 
					Fgf9, which up-regulates 
					Fgf9 and represses 
					Wnt4 to establish the testis pathway. Surprisingly, loss of 
					Wnt4 in XX gonads is sufficient to up-regulate 
					Fgf9 and 
					Sox9 in the absence of 
					Sry. These data suggest that the fate of the gonad is controlled by antagonism between 
					Fgf9 and 
					Wnt4. The role of the male sex-determining switch—
					Sry in the case of mammals—is to tip the balance between these underlying patterning signals. In principle, sex determination in other vertebrates may operate through any switch that introduces an imbalance between these two signaling pathways.
