Interactions between membrane proteins are poorly understood despite their importance in cell signaling and drug development. Here, we present a co-immunoimmobilization assay (Co-II) enabling the direct observation of membrane protein interactions in single living cells that overcomes the limitations of currently prevalent proximity-based indirect methods. Using Co-II, we investigated the transient homodimerizations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) in living cells, revealing the differential regulation of these receptors’ dimerizations by molecular conformations and microenvironment in a plasma membrane. Co-II should provide a simple, rapid, and robust platform for visualizing both weak and strong protein interactions in the plasma membrane of living cells.
