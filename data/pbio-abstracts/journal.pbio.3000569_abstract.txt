Membrane proteins are organized in nanoscale compartments. Their reorganization plays a crucial role in receptor activation and cell signaling. To monitor the organization and reorganization of membrane proteins, we developed a new branched proximity hybridization assay (bPHA) allowing better quantification of the nanoscale proteinâ€“protein proximity. In this assay, oligo-coupled binding probes, such as aptamer, nanobody, and antibodies, are used to translate the proximity of target proteins to the proximity of oligos. The closely positioned oligos then serve as a template for a maximum of 400-fold branched DNA (bDNA) signal amplification. The amplified bPHA signal is recorded by flow cytometer, thus enabling proximity studies with high throughput, multiplexing, and single-cell resolution. To demonstrate the potential of the bPHA method, we measured the reorganization of the immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and immunoglobulin D (IgD)-class B cell antigen receptor (BCR) on the plasma membrane and the recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) to the BCR upon B lymphocyte activation.
