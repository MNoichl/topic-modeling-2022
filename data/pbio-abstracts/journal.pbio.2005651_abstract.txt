Cilia are organelles specialized in movement and signal transduction. The ciliary transient receptor potential ion channel polycystin-2 (TRPP2) controls elementary cilia-mediated physiological functions ranging from male fertility and kidney development to left–right patterning. However, the molecular components translating TRPP2 channel–mediated Ca2+ signals into respective physiological functions are unknown. Here, we show that the Ca2+-regulated mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi solute carrier 25 A 25 (SLC25A25) acts downstream of TRPP2 in an evolutionarily conserved metabolic signaling pathway. We identify SLC25A25 as an essential component in this cilia-dependent pathway using a genome-wide forward genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, followed by a targeted analysis of SLC25A25 function in zebrafish left–right patterning. Our data suggest that TRPP2 ion channels regulate mitochondrial SLC25A25 transporters via Ca2+ establishing an evolutionarily conserved molecular link between ciliary signaling and mitochondrial metabolism.
