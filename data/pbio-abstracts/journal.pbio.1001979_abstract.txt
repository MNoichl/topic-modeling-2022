The pathway that regulates asymmetric cell division in Caulobacter involves a signaling kinase whose catalytic output domain has been repurposed as an input sensor of the phosphorylation state of the response regulator â€“ a reversal of the conventional direction of information flow; this allows wiring of simple linear signaling pathways into complex eukaryote-like networks.
