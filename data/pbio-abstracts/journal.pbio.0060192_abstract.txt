In a similar manner to humans, fly circadian clock proteins are regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites, which affect a protein's activity or stability. A suicide model for destruction of transcriptional machinery may explain a conserved mechanism that gives the circadian clock a chance to respond to varying cellular influences throughout the circadian day.
