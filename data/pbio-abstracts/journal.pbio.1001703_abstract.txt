This study describes, for the first time, the rhythmic translational program within circadian clock cells. The results indicate that most clock cell mRNAs are translated at low-energy times of either mid-day or mid-night, and also that related cellular functions are coordinately regulated by the synchronized translation of relevant mRNAs at the same time of day.
