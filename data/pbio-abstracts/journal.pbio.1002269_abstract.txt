Sepsis, an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response, remains a major medical challenge. Both hyperinflammation and immunosuppression are implicated as causes of morbidity and mortality. Dendritic cell (DC) loss has been observed in septic patients and in experimental sepsis models, but the role of DCs in sepsis, and the mechanisms and significance of DC loss, are poorly understood. Here, we report that mice with selective deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in DCs (GRCD11c-cre) were highly susceptible to LPS-induced septic shock, evidenced by elevated inflammatory cytokine production, hypothermia, and mortality. Neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibodies prevented hypothermia and death, demonstrating that endogenous GC-mediated suppression of IL-12 is protective. In LPS-challenged GRCD11c-cre mice, CD8+ DCs were identified as the major source of prolonged IL-12 production, which correlated with elevations of NK cell-derived IFN-Î³. In addition, the loss of GR in CD11c+ cells rescued LPS-induced loss of CD8+ DCs but not other DC subsets. Unlike wild-type animals, exposure of GRCD11c-cre mice to low-dose LPS did not induce CD8+ DC loss or tolerance to subsequent challenge with high dose, but neutralization of IL-12 restored the ability of low-dose LPS to tolerize. Therefore, endogenous glucocorticoids blunt LPS-induced inflammation and promote tolerance by suppressing DC IL-12 production.
