Viewing the Invisible is a multimedia collaboration that explores common methodology between arts and sciences. Portraits of science influencers were painted while dialogue between artist and subject was filmed. Here, we show the implementation of our recent exhibition as a model that can be adapted for use elsewhere in public or school settings to challenge misconceptions about the role of creativity in science and technical precision in art.
