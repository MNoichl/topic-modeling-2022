Structural integrity of the extracellular membrane-proximal stalk region of CD3Îµ is required for efficient signaling by the T cell antigen receptor complex. The results in this article suggest that receptor aggregation may not be sufficient for a complete T cell receptor signal and that some type of direct allosteric signal may be involved.
