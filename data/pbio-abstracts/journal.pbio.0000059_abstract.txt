Complete inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is extremely
          common in advanced cancer, including prostate cancer (CaP). However, one
          PTEN allele is already lost in the vast majority of CaPs at presentation.
          To determine the consequence of PTEN dose variations on cancer progression, we have
          generated by homologous recombination a hypomorphic Pten mouse mutant
          series with decreasing Pten activity: Ptenhy/+
          &gt; Pten+/− &gt;
            Ptenhy/− (mutants in which we have rescued the
          embryonic lethality due to complete Pten inactivation) &gt;
            Pten prostate conditional knockout (Ptenpc)
          mutants. In addition, we have generated and comparatively analyzed two distinct
            Ptenpc mutants in which Pten is inactivated
          focally or throughout the entire prostatic epithelium. We find that the extent of
            Pten inactivation dictate in an exquisite dose-dependent fashion CaP
          progression, its incidence, latency, and biology. The dose of Pten affects key downstream
          targets such as Akt, p27Kip1, mTOR, and FOXO3. Our results provide conclusive
          genetic support for the notion that PTEN is haploinsufficient in tumor
          suppression and that its dose is a key determinant in cancer progression.
