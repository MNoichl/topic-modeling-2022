The sensitivity of genotype-based diagnostics that predict antimicrobial susceptibility is limited by the extent to which they detect genes and alleles that lead to resistance. As novel resistance variants are expected to emerge, such sensitivity is expected to decline unless the new variants are detected and incorporated into the diagnostic. Here, we present a mathematical framework to define how many diagnostic failures may be expected under varying surveillance regimes and thus quantify the surveillance needed to maintain the sensitivity of genotype-based diagnostics.
