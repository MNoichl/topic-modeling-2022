For many years, double-layer phospholipid membrane vesicles, released by most cells, were not considered to be of biological significance. This stance has dramatically changed with the recognition of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers of biologically active molecules that can traffic to local or distant targets and execute defined biological functions. The dimensionality of the field has expanded with the appreciation of diverse types of EVs and the complexity of vesicle biogenesis, cargo loading, release pathways, targeting mechanisms, and vesicle processing. With the expanded interest in the field and the accelerated rate of publications on EV structure and function in diverse biomedical fields, it has become difficult to distinguish between well-established biological features of EV and the untested hypotheses or speculative assumptions that await experimental proof. With the growing interest despite the limited evidence, we sought in this essay to formulate a set of unsolved mysteries in the field, sort out established data from fascinating hypotheses, and formulate several challenging questions that must be answered for the field to advance.
