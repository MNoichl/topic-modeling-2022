FUS/TLS is a nucleic acid binding protein that, when mutated, can cause a subset
                    of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). Although FUS/TLS is normally
                    located predominantly in the nucleus, the pathogenic mutant forms of FUS/TLS
                    traffic to, and form inclusions in, the cytoplasm of affected spinal motor
                    neurons or glia. Here we report a yeast model of human FUS/TLS expression that
                    recapitulates multiple salient features of the pathology of the disease-causing
                    mutant proteins, including nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation, inclusion
                    formation, and cytotoxicity. Protein domain analysis indicates that the
                    carboxyl-terminus of FUS/TLS, where most of the ALS-associated mutations are
                    clustered, is required but not sufficient for the toxicity of the protein. A
                    genome-wide genetic screen using a yeast over-expression library identified five
                    yeast DNA/RNA binding proteins, encoded by the yeast genes
                        ECM32, NAM8, SBP1,
                        SKO1, and VHR1, that rescue the toxicity
                    of human FUS/TLS without changing its expression level, cytoplasmic
                    translocation, or inclusion formation. Furthermore, hUPF1, a
                    human homologue of ECM32, also rescues the toxicity of FUS/TLS
                    in this model, validating the yeast model and implicating a possible
                    insufficiency in RNA processing or the RNA quality control machinery in the
                    mechanism of FUS/TLS mediated toxicity. Examination of the effect of FUS/TLS
                    expression on the decay of selected mRNAs in yeast indicates that the
                    nonsense-mediated decay pathway is probably not the major determinant of either
                    toxicity or suppression.
