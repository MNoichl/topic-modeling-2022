Peptide-based intercellular communication is a ubiquitous and ancient process that predates evolution of the nervous system. Cilia are essential signaling centers that both receive information from the environment and secrete bioactive extracellular vesicles (ectosomes). However, the nature of these secreted signals and their biological functions remain poorly understood. Here, we report the developmentally regulated release of the peptide amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine Î±-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), and the presence of peptidergic signaling machinery (including propeptide precursors, subtilisin-like prohormone convertases, amidated products, and receptors) in ciliary ectosomes from the green alga Chlamydomonas. One identified amidated PAM product serves as a chemoattractant for mating-type minus gametes but repels plus gametes. Thus, cilia provide a previously unappreciated route for the secretion of amidated signaling peptides. Our study in Chlamydomonas and the presence of PAM in mammalian cilia suggest that ciliary ectosome-mediated peptidergic signaling dates to the early eukaryotes and plays key roles in metazoan physiology.
