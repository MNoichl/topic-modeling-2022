Our sensory systems have evolved to provide us with information about the external world. Such information is useful only insofar as it leads to actions that enhance fitness, and thus, the link between sensation and action has been thoroughly studied in many species. In insects, for example, specific visual stimuli lead to highly stereotyped responses. In contrast, humans can exhibit a wide range of responses to the same stimulus, as occurs most notably in the phenomenon of multistable perception. On this basis, one might think that humans have a fundamentally different way of generating actions from sensory inputs, but Toepfer et al. show that flies show evidence of multistable perception as well. Specifically, when confronted with a sensory stimulus that can yield different motor responses, flies switch from one response to another with temporal dynamics that are similar to those of humans and other animals. This suggests that the mechanisms that give rise to the rich repertoire of sensory experience in humans have correlates in much simpler nervous systems.
