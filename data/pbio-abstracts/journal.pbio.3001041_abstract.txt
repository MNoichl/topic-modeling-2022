The capacity for T cells to become activated and clonally expand during pathogen invasion is pivotal for protective immunity. Our understanding of how T cell receptor (TCR) signaling prepares cells for this rapid expansion remains limited. Here we provide evidence that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-4b (Cul4b) regulates this process. The abundance of total and neddylated Cul4b increased following TCR stimulation. Disruption of Cul4b resulted in impaired proliferation and survival of activated T cells. Additionally, Cul4b-deficient CD4+ T cells accumulated DNA damage. In T cells, Cul4b preferentially associated with the substrate receptor DCAF1, and Cul4b and DCAF1 were found to interact with proteins that promote the sensing or repair of damaged DNA. While Cul4b-deficient CD4+ T cells showed evidence of DNA damage sensing, downstream phosphorylation of SMC1A did not occur. These findings reveal an essential role for Cul4b in promoting the repair of damaged DNA to allow survival and expansion of activated T cells.
