With the rapid improvement of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) resolution, new computational tools are needed to assist and improve upon atomic model building and refinement options. This communication demonstrates that microscopists can now collaborate with the players of the computer game Foldit to generate high-quality de novo structural models. This development could greatly speed the generation of excellent cryo-EM structures when used in addition to current methods.
