G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an important role in physiology and disease and represent the most productive drug targets. Orphan GPCRs, with their endogenous ligands unknown, were considered a source of drug targets and consequently attract great interest to identify their endogenous cognate ligands for deorphanization. However, a contrary view to the ubiquitous existence of endogenous ligands for every GPCR is that there might be a significant overlooked fraction of orphan GPCRs that function constitutively in a ligand-independent manner only. Here, we investigated the evolution of the bombesin receptor–ligand family in vertebrates in which one member—bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3)—is a potential orphan GPCR. With analysis of 17 vertebrate BRS3 structures and 10 vertebrate BRS3 functional data, our results demonstrated that nonplacental vertebrate BRS3 still connects to the original ligands—neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)—because of adaptive evolution, with significantly changed protein structure, especially in three altered key residues (Q127R, P205S, and R294H) originally involved in ligand binding/activation, whereas the placental mammalian BRS3 lost the binding affinity to NMB/GRP and constitutively activates Gs/Gq/G12 signaling in a ligand-independent manner. Moreover, the N terminus of placental mammalian BRS3 underwent positive selection, exhibiting significant structural differences compared to nonplacental vertebrate BRS3, and this domain plays an important role in constitutive activity of placental mammalian BRS3. In conclusion, constitutively active BRS3 is a genuinely orphan GPCR in placental mammals, including human. To our knowledge, this study identified the first example that might represent a new group of genuinely orphan GPCRs that will never be deorphanized by the discovery of a natural ligand and provided new perspectives in addition to the current ligand-driven GPCR deorphanization.
