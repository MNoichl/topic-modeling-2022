Lipid species patterns are conserved within cells to maintain physicochemical properties of membranes and cellular functions. We present the lipidome, including sterols, glycerolipids (GLs), glycerophospholipids (GPLs), and sphingolipids (SLs), of primary ex vivo differentiated (I) white, (II) brite, and (III) brown adipocytes derived from primary preadipocytes isolated from (I) epididymal white, (II) inguinal white, and (III) intrascapular brown adipose tissue. Quantitative lipidomics revealed significantly decreased fractions of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), with longer (C &gt; 36) and more polyunsaturated species, as well as lower levels of cardiolipin (CL) in white than in brite and brown adipocytes. Together, the brite and brown lipidome was comparable and indicates differences in membrane lipid packing density compared with white adipocytes. Changes in ceramide species profile could be related to the degree of browning. Beta-adrenergic stimulation of brown adipocytes led to generation of saturated lyso-PC (LPC) increasing uncoupling protein (UCP) 1-mediated leak respiration. Application of stable isotope labeling showed that LPC formation was balanced by an increased de novo synthesis of PC.
