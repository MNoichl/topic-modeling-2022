Extremely large datasets have become routine in biology. However, performing a computational analysis of a large dataset can be overwhelming, especially for novices. Here, we present a step-by-step guide to computing workflows with the biologist end-user in mind. Starting from a foundation of sound data management practices, we make specific recommendations on how to approach and perform computational analyses of large datasets, with a view to enabling sound, reproducible biological research.
