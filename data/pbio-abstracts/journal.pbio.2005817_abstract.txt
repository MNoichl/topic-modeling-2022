Over the last decade, multiple broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) to the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) gp120 have been described. Many of these recognize epitopes consisting of both amino acid and glycan residues. Moreover, the glycans required for binding of these bN-mAbs are early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This type of glycosylation substantially alters the mass and net charge of Envs compared to molecules with the same amino acid sequence but possessing mature, complex (sialic acid–containing) carbohydrates. Since cell lines suitable for biopharmaceutical production that limit N-linked glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates are not readily available, the production of vaccine immunogens displaying these glycan-dependent epitopes has been challenging. Here, we report the development of a stable suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that limits glycosylation to Man5 and earlier intermediates. This cell line was created using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing system and contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1). Monomeric gp120s produced in the MGAT1− CHO cell line exhibit improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent bN-mAbs directed to the V1/V2 domain (e.g., PG9) and the V3 stem (e.g., PGT128 and 10–1074) while preserving the structure of the important glycan-independent epitopes (e.g., VRC01). The ability of the MGAT1− CHO cell line to limit glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway without impairing the doubling time or ability to grow at high cell densities suggests that it will be a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.
