Structure-function studies reveal that Rap proteins have distinct, nonoverlapping surfaces that interact with different cellular targets, and that for antiactivator RapF, one surface mimics DNA to bind a response regulator DNA binding domain, thereby sterically preventing the activity of this transcription transactivator.
