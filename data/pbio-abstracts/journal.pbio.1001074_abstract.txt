Protein N-terminal acetylation is a major modification of eukaryotic proteins.
                    Its functional implications include regulation of proteinâ€“protein
                    interactions and targeting to membranes, as demonstrated by studies of a handful
                    of proteins. Fifty years after its discovery, a potential general function of
                    the N-terminal acetyl group carried by thousands of unique proteins remains
                    enigmatic. However, recent functional data suggest roles for N-terminal
                    acetylation as a degradation signal and as a determining factor for preventing
                    protein targeting to the secretory pathway, thus highlighting N-terminal
                    acetylation as a major determinant for the life and death of proteins. These
                    contributions represent new and intriguing hypotheses that will guide the
                    research in the years to come.
