The authors of this research article demonstrate the nature of the conformational changes MnmE was previously suggested to undergo during its GTPase cycle, and show the nucleotide-dependent dynamic movements of the G domains around two swivel positions relative to the rest of the protein. These movements are of crucial importance for understanding the mechanistic principles of this GAD.
