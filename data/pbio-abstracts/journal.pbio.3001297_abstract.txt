Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators in the central nervous system (CNS). However, their roles in the cerebellum are currently unclear. In this work, we identified the isoform 204 of lncRNA Gm2694 (designated as lncRNA-Promoting Methylation (lncRNA-PM)) is highly expressed in the cerebellum and derived from the antisense strand of the upstream region of Cerebellin-1 (Cbln1), a well-known critical cerebellar synaptic organizer. LncRNA-PM exhibits similar spatiotemporal expression pattern as Cbln1 in the postnatal mouse cerebellum and activates the transcription of Cbln1 through Pax6/Mll1-mediated H3K4me3. In mouse cerebellum, lncRNA-PM, Pax6/Mll1, and H3K4me3 are all associated with the regulatory regions of Cbln1. Knockdown of lncRNA-PM in cerebellum causes deficiencies in Cbln1 expression, cerebellar synaptic integrity, and motor function. Together, our work reveals an lncRNA-mediated transcriptional activation of Cbln1 through Pax6-Mll1-H3K4me3 and provides novel insights of the essential roles of lncRNA in the cerebellum.
